review,"Passive technologies for future large-scale photonic integrated circuits on silicon: polarization handling, light non-reciprocity and loss reduction","<p>Silicon-based large-scale photonic integrated circuits are becoming important, due to the need for higher complexity and lower cost for optical transmitters, receivers and optical buffers. In this paper, passive technologies for large-scale photonic integrated circuits are described, including polarization handling, light non-reciprocity and loss reduction. The design rule for polarization beam splitters based on asymmetrical directional couplers is summarized and several novel designs for ultra-short polarization beam splitters are reviewed. A novel concept for realizing a polarization splitter&#8211;rotator is presented with a very simple fabrication process. Realization of silicon-based light non-reciprocity devices (e.g., optical isolator), which is very important for transmitters to avoid sensitivity to reflections, is also demonstrated with the help of magneto-optical material by the bonding technology. Low-loss waveguides are another important technology for large-scale photonic integrated circuits. Ultra-low loss optical waveguides are achieved by designing a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> core with a very high aspect ratio. The loss is reduced further to &lt;0.1 dB m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with an improved fabrication process incorporating a high-quality thermal oxide upper cladding by means of wafer bonding. With the developed ultra-low loss Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> optical waveguides, some devices are also demonstrated, including ultra-high-Q ring resonators, low-loss arrayed-waveguide grating (de)multiplexers, and high-extinction-ratio polarizers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, USA', 'authors': ['Daoxin Dai', ',\xa0Jared Bauters', '\xa0&\xa0John E Bowers']}, {'address': 'Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, State Key Laboratory for Modern Optical Instrumentation, Zhejiang University, Zijingang, Hangzhou 310058, China', 'authors': ['Daoxin Dai']}]",True,"['Daoxin Dai', 'Jared Bauters', 'John E Bowers']","Dai, D., Bauters, J. & Bowers, J.

original article,Coherent excitation transfer via the dark-state channel in a bionic system,"<p>Light absorption and energy transfer were studied in a bionic system with donors and an acceptor. In the optimal case of uniform couplings, this seemingly complicated system was reduced to a three-level &#923;-type system. With this observation, we showed that the efficiency of energy transfer through a dark-state channel, which is free of the spontaneous decay of the donors, was dramatically improved. After the overall average transfer time was evaluated, it was revealed that the time required for transfer through this channel was not optimal. To find the optimal parameters for the present system, we defined a new quantity, output power, which characterizes the average mean output of the whole transfer process. We estimated the optimal parameters of the system to achieve the maximum output power. The splitting behaviour of the maximum power may be used to explain the phenomenon of photosynthetic systems primarily absorbing two colours of light.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Theoretical Physics, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China', 'authors': ['Hui Dong', ',\xa0Da-Zhi Xu', ',\xa0Jin-Feng Huang', '\xa0&\xa0Chang-Pu Sun']}]",True,"['Hui Dong', 'Da-Zhi Xu', 'Jin-Feng Huang', 'Chang-Pu Sun']","Dong, H., Xu, D., Huang, J. et al.
