original article,Simultaneous additive and subtractive three-dimensional nanofabrication using integrated two-photon polymerization and multiphoton ablation,"<p>Modern three-dimensional nanofabrication requires both additive and subtractive processes. However, both processes are largely isolated and generally regarded as incompatible with each other. In this study, we developed simultaneous additive and subtractive fabrication processes using two-photon polymerization followed by femtosecond (fs) laser multiphoton ablation. To demonstrate the new capability, submicrometer polymer fibers containing periodic holes of 500-nm diameter and microfluidic channels of 1-&#181;m diameter were successfully fabricated. This method combining both two-photon polymerization and fs laser ablation improves the nanofabrication efficiency and enables the fabrication of complex three-dimensional micro-/nanostructures, promising for a wide range of applications in integrated optics, microfluidics and microelectromechanical systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68588-0511, USA', 'authors': ['Wei Xiong', ',\xa0Yun Shen Zhou', ',\xa0Xiang Nan He', ',\xa0Yang Gao', ',\xa0Masoud Mahjouri-Samani', ',\xa0Tommaso Baldacchini', '\xa0&\xa0Yong Feng Lu']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China', 'authors': ['Lan Jiang']}, {'address': 'Technology and Applications Center, Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA 92606, USA', 'authors': ['Tommaso Baldacchini']}]",True,"['Wei Xiong', 'Yun Shen Zhou', 'Xiang Nan He', 'Yang Gao', 'Masoud Mahjouri-Samani', 'Lan Jiang', 'Tommaso Baldacchini', 'Yong Feng Lu']","Xiong, W., Zhou, Y., He, X. et al.

original article,Yb-doped large-pitch fibres: effective single-mode operation based on higher-order mode delocalisation,"<p>Rare earth-doped fibres are a diode-pumped, solid-state laser architecture that is highly scalable in average power. The performance of pulsed fibre laser systems is restricted due to nonlinear effects. Hence, fibre designs that allow for very large mode areas at high average powers with diffraction-limited beam quality are of enormous interest. Ytterbium-doped, rod-type, large-pitch fibres (LPF) enable extreme fibre dimensions, i.e., effective single-mode fibres with mode sizes exceeding 100 times the wavelength of the guided radiation, by exploiting the novel concept of delocalisation of higher-order transverse modes. The non-resonant nature of the operating principle makes LPF suitable for high power extraction. This design allows for an unparalleled level of performance in pulsed fibre lasers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Applied Physics, Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, 07745 Jena, Germany', 'authors': ['Jens Limpert', ',\xa0Fabian Stutzki', ',\xa0Florian Jansen', ',\xa0Hans-Jürgen Otto', ',\xa0Tino Eidam', ',\xa0Cesar Jauregui', '\xa0&\xa0Andreas Tünnermann']}, {'address': 'Helmholtz Institute Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany', 'authors': ['Jens Limpert', ',\xa0Tino Eidam', '\xa0&\xa0Andreas Tünnermann']}, {'address': 'Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, 07745 Jena, Germany', 'authors': ['Jens Limpert', '\xa0&\xa0Andreas Tünnermann']}]",True,"['Jens Limpert', 'Fabian Stutzki', 'Florian Jansen', 'Hans-Jürgen Otto', 'Tino Eidam', 'Cesar Jauregui', 'Andreas Tünnermann']","Limpert, J., Stutzki, F., Jansen, F. et al.
