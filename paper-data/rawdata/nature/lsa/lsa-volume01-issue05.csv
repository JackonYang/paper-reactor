review,Hardfacing steel with nanostructured coatings of Stellite-6 by supersonic laser deposition,"<p>The ability to manufacture coatings is critical to engineering design. Many components require the application of additional layers to enhance mechanical properties and protect against hostile environments. Supersonic laser deposition (SLD) is a novel coating method based on cold spray (CS) principles. In this technique, the deposition velocities can be significantly lower than those required for effective bonding in CS applications. The addition of laser heat energy permits a change in the thermodynamic experience of impacting particles, thereby offering a greater opportunity for efficient bonding at lower velocities as compared with the CS process. The work reported in this paper demonstrates the ability of the SLD process to deliver hardfacing materials to engineering surfaces. Stellite-6 has been deposited on low-carbon steel tubes over a range of process parameters to establish the appropriate target power and traverse speeds for the coating formation. The coating properties and parameters were examined to determine the primary characteristics and grain structure size. Their morphology and performance were studied through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction, hardness measurements and wear testing. The results have shown that SLD is capable of depositing layers of Stellite-6, with properties that are superior to those of their conventionally manufactured counterparts.</p>",[],True,"[""Rocco Lupoi"", ""Andrew Cockburn"", ""Chris Bryan"", ""Martin Sparkes"", ""Fang Luo"", ""William O'Neill""]","Lupoi, R., Cockburn, A., Bryan, C. et al.

review,Bismuth-doped optical fibers: a challenging active medium for near-IR lasers and optical amplifiers,<p>It has recently been demonstrated that Bi-doped glass optical fibers are a promising active laser medium. Various types of Bi-doped optical fibers have been developed and used to construct Bi-doped fiber lasers and optical amplifiers. This paper reviews the recent results regarding the luminescence properties of various Bi-doped optical fibers and the development of Bi-doped fiber lasers and optical amplifiers for the 1150 to 1550 nm spectral region.</p>,[],True,"[""Evgeny M Dianov""]","Dianov, E.
