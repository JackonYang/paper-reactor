review,Hardfacing steel with nanostructured coatings of Stellite-6 by supersonic laser deposition,"<p>The ability to manufacture coatings is critical to engineering design. Many components require the application of additional layers to enhance mechanical properties and protect against hostile environments. Supersonic laser deposition (SLD) is a novel coating method based on cold spray (CS) principles. In this technique, the deposition velocities can be significantly lower than those required for effective bonding in CS applications. The addition of laser heat energy permits a change in the thermodynamic experience of impacting particles, thereby offering a greater opportunity for efficient bonding at lower velocities as compared with the CS process. The work reported in this paper demonstrates the ability of the SLD process to deliver hardfacing materials to engineering surfaces. Stellite-6 has been deposited on low-carbon steel tubes over a range of process parameters to establish the appropriate target power and traverse speeds for the coating formation. The coating properties and parameters were examined to determine the primary characteristics and grain structure size. Their morphology and performance were studied through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction, hardness measurements and wear testing. The results have shown that SLD is capable of depositing layers of Stellite-6, with properties that are superior to those of their conventionally manufactured counterparts.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Engineering, Institute for Manufacturing, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0FS, UK', 'authors': ['Rocco Lupoi', ',\xa0Andrew Cockburn', ',\xa0Chris Bryan', ',\xa0Martin Sparkes', ""\xa0&\xa0William O'Neill""]}, {'address': 'College of Zhijiang, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310024, China', 'authors': ['Fang Luo']}]",True,"['Rocco Lupoi', 'Andrew Cockburn', 'Chris Bryan', 'Martin Sparkes', 'Fang Luo', ""William O'Neill""]","Lupoi, R., Cockburn, A., Bryan, C. et al.
