original article,Surface plasmon resonance of layer-by-layer gold nanoparticles induced photoelectric current in environmentally-friendly plasmon-sensitized solar cell,"<p>Layer-by-layer gold nanoparticles are used to generate photocurrent in an environmentally-friendly plasmon-sensitized solar cell towing to surface plasmon resonance. The efficiency of the photoelectric conversion of gold nanoparticle layers is increased as the intensity of surface plasmon resonance increases. We also explain the experimental results by modeling the phenomenon of charge separation and photocurrent formation, and the relationship between surface plasmon resonance and photocurrent formation, which has potential application in plasmon-sensitized solar cells and plasmonic solar cells in the future.</p>",[],True,"[""Yen-Hsun Su"", ""Yuan-Feng Ke"", ""Shi-Liang Cai"", ""Qian-Yu Yao""]","Su, YH., Ke, YF., Cai, SL. et al.

original article,Single and multiple optical switches that use freestanding silicon nanowire waveguide couplers,"<p>Silicon photonic devices consisting of nanowire waveguides are a promising technology for on-chip integration in future optical telecommunication and interconnection systems based on silicon-large scale integration fabrication. However, the accommodation of variable optical components on a chip remains challenging due to the small size of microchips. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of a microelectromechanical silicon nanowire waveguide switch with a gap-variable coupler. Due to its capacitive operation, the proposed waveguide switch consumed negligible power relative to switches that use a thermo-optical effect and carrier injection. The proposed switch was characterized using analyses based on coupled-mode theory for rectangular waveguides, as well as a simulation using the finite difference time domain method. A 2&#215;2 single switch with an improved configuration and a 2&#215;6 multiple switch composed of the 2&#215;2 switches was designed and fabricated by a combination of electron beam lithography, fast-atom beam etching and hydrofluoric acid vapor sacrificial etching. The properties of the switches were measured and evaluated at a wavelength of 1.55&#160;&#181;m.</p>",[],True,"[""Yuta Akihama"", ""Kazuhiro Hane""]","Akihama, Y., Hane, K.
