original article,Controlling light-with-light without nonlinearity,"<p>According to the fundamental Huygens superposition principle, light beams traveling in a linear medium will pass though one another without mutual disturbance. Indeed, the field of photonics is based on the premise that controlling light signals with light requires intense laser fields to facilitate beam interactions in nonlinear media, where the superposition principle can be broken. Here we challenge this wisdom and demonstrate that two coherent beams of light of arbitrarily low intensity can interact on a metamaterial layer of nanoscale thickness in such a way that one beam modulates the intensity of the other. We show that the interference of beams can eliminate the plasmonic Joule losses of light energy in the metamaterial or, in contrast, can lead to almost total absorption of light. Applications of this phenomenon may lie in ultrafast all-optical pulse-recovery devices, coherence filters and terahertz-bandwidth light-by-light modulators.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre & Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton, Southampton, Hampshire SO17 1BJ, UK', 'authors': ['Jianfa Zhang', ',\xa0Kevin F MacDonald', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}]",True,"['Jianfa Zhang', 'Kevin F MacDonald', 'Nikolay I Zheludev']","Zhang, J., MacDonald, K. & Zheludev, N.

review,Metallic subwavelength-cavity semiconductor nanolasers,"<p>Miniaturization has been an everlasting theme in the development of semiconductor lasers. One important breakthrough in this process in recent years is the use of metal-dielectric composite structures that made truly subwavelength lasers possible. Many different designs of metallic cavity semiconductor nanolasers have been proposed and demonstrated. In this article, we will review some of the most exciting progresses in this newly emerging field. In particular, we will focus on metallic-cavity nanolasers with volume smaller than wavelength cubed under electrical injection with emphasis on high-temperature operation. Such devices will serve as an important component in the future integrated nanophotonic systems due to its ultra-small size.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA', 'authors': ['K.
