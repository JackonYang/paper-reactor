original article,High-brightness polarized light-emitting diodes,"<p>Light-emitting diodes are becoming the alternative for future general lighting applications, with huge energy savings compared to conventional light sources owing to their high efficiency and reliability. Polarized light sources would largely enhance the efficiency in a number of applications, such as in liquid-crystal displays, and also greatly improve contrast in general illumination due to the reduction in indirect glare. Here, we demonstrate light-emitting diodes presenting high-brightness polarized light emission by combining the polarization-preserving and directional extraction properties of embedded photonic-crystals applied to non-polar gallium nitride. A directional enhancement of up to 1.8-fold was observed in the total polarized light emission together with a high polarization degree of 88.7% at 465&#160;nm. We discuss the mechanisms of polarized light emission in non-polar gallium nitride and the photonic-crystal design rules to further increase the light-emitting diode brightness. This work could open the way to polarized white-light emitters through their association with polarization-preserving down-converting phosphors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Elison Matioli']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Stuart Brinkley', ',\xa0Kathryn M Kelchner', ',\xa0Shuji Nakamura', '\xa0&\xa0Steven DenBaars']}, {'address': 'Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Yan-Ling Hu', ',\xa0Shuji Nakamura', ',\xa0Steven DenBaars', ',\xa0James Speck', '\xa0&\xa0Claude Weisbuch']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire de Physique de la Matière Condensée, CNRS, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France', 'authors': ['Claude Weisbuch']}]",True,"['Elison Matioli', 'Stuart Brinkley', 'Kathryn M Kelchner', 'Yan-Ling Hu', 'Shuji Nakamura', 'Steven DenBaars', 'James Speck', 'Claude Weisbuch']","Matioli, E., Brinkley, S., Kelchner, K. et al.

original article,Wavefront shaping of infrared light through a subwavelength hole,"<p>Light passing through a subwavelength hole in an opaque plate is a fundamental concern in both optical science and applications. Using both simulations and experiments, we show that, when a subwavelength hole in a silver thin film is surrounded by well-designed patterns of grooves, the wavefront of the infrared light through it can be shaped into a preset complicated pattern such as a Latin letter &#8216;L&#8217; or &#8216;O&#8217; at a given position instead of being diffracted in all directions. The design is created via the surface-wave-holography method, which allows direct determination of the surface plasmonic structure for a given wavefront-engineering functionality without the need to solve complex inverse problems. The results will deepen current understanding of this enduring issue and will find applications in many fields such as wave manipulation and sensing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory of Optical Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China', 'authors': ['Yu-Hui Chen', ',\xa0Lu Huang', ',\xa0Lin Gan', '\xa0&\xa0Zhi-Yuan Li']}]",True,"['Yu-Hui Chen', 'Lu Huang', 'Lin Gan', 'Zhi-Yuan Li']","Chen, Y., Huang, L., Gan, L. et al.

review,Spectral selectivity in infrared thermal detection,"<p>A review is made of the physics and technology of spectrally selective thermal detectors, especially those operating at non-cryogenic temperatures. The background radiation noise fluctuations are rederived for arbitrary spectral characteristics. Infrared absorption due to phonons and free carriers is discussed followed by a review of published works on artificial infrared absorption materials such as patterned grids, nanoparticles, plasmonic structures, metamaterials and others. Subsequently, the literature of the spectral characteristics of broadband thermal detectors and spectrally selective thermal detectors is reviewed. Finally, the authors speculate on the directions that future research and development in the area will take regarding architectures, sensitivity and spectral characteristics. </p>",,"[{'address': 'Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA', 'authors': ['Joseph J Talghader', ',\xa0Anand S Gawarikar', '\xa0&\xa0Ryan P Shea']}]",True,"['Joseph J Talghader', 'Anand S Gawarikar', 'Ryan P Shea']","Talghader, J., Gawarikar, A. & Shea, R.
