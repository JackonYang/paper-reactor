review,Electrodynamics of transformation-based invisibility cloaking,"<p>The existing knowledge on the electrodynamics of invisibility cloaking based on transformation optics is reviewed from an integrated science and engineering perspective. Several significant electromagnetic problems that have resulted in intense discussions in the past few years are summarized in terms of propagation, scattering, radiation and fabrication. Finally, the road ahead toward invisibility cloaking and transformation optics is discussed from the viewpoint of the author.</p>",[],True,"[""Baile Zhang""]","Zhang, B.

original article,Nanofluid-based optical filter optimization for PV/T systems,"<p>Optical filters are essential in a wide range of applications, including optical communications, electronics, lighting, optical sensors and photography. This article presents recent work which indicates that optical filters can be created from specialized nanoparticle suspensions. Specifically, this article describes a theoretical optimization process for designing nanofluid-based filters for hybrid solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) applications. This particular application is suitable because nanofluids can be utilized as both volumetric solar absorbers and flowing heat transfer mediums. The nanofluid filters described in this work compare favorably with conventional optical filters for five photovoltaic (PV) cell alternatives: InGaP, CdTe, InGaAs, Si, and Ge. This study demonstrates that nanofluids make efficient, compact and potentially low-cost, spectrally selective optical filters.</p>",[],True,"[""Robert A Taylor"", ""Todd Otanicar"", ""Gary Rosengarten""]","Taylor, R., Otanicar, T. & Rosengarten, G.
