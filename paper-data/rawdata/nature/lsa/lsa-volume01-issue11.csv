original article,Solving the inverse grating problem by white light interference Fourier scatterometry,"<p>Scatterometry is a well-established, fast and precise optical metrology method used for the characterization of sub-lambda periodic features. The Fourier scatterometry method, by analyzing the Fourier plane, makes it possible to collect the angle-resolved diffraction spectrum without any mechanical scanning. To improve the depth sensitivity of this method, we combine it with white light interferometry. We show the exemplary application of the method on a silicon line grating. To characterize the sub-lambda features of the grating structures, we apply a model-based reconstruction approach by comparing simulated and measured spectra. All simulations are based on the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Applied Optics, Stuttgart University, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany', 'authors': ['Valeriano Ferreras Paz', ',\xa0Sandy Peterhänsel', ',\xa0Karsten Frenner', '\xa0&\xa0Wolfgang Osten']}, {'address': 'SCoPE—Stuttgart Research Center of Photonic Engineering, Stuttgart University, Stuttgart, Germany', 'authors': ['Wolfgang Osten']}]",True,"['Valeriano Ferreras Paz', 'Sandy Peterhänsel', 'Karsten Frenner', 'Wolfgang Osten']","Ferreras Paz, V., Peterhänsel, S., Frenner, K. et al.

original article,Integrated photonic systems based on transformation optics enabled gradient index devices,"<p>Integrated photonics is expected to play an increasingly important role in optical communications, imaging, computing and sensing with the promise for significant reduction in the cost and weight of these systems. Future advancement of this technology is critically dependent on an ability to develop compact and reliable optical components and facilitate their integration on a common substrate. Here we reveal, with the utility of the emerging transformation optics technique, that functional components composed of planar gradient index materials can be designed and readily integrated into photonic circuits. The unprecedented design flexibility of transformation optics allows for the creation of a number of novel devices, such as a light source collimator, waveguide adapters and a waveguide crossing, which have broad applications in integrated photonic chips and are compatible with current fabrication technology. Using the finite-difference time-domain method, we perform full-wave numerical simulations to demonstrate their superior optical performance and efficient integration with other components in an on-chip photonic system. These components only require spatially-varying dielectric materials with no magnetic properties, facilitating low-loss, broadband operation in an integrated photonic environment.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA', 'authors': ['Qi Wu', ',\xa0Jeremiah P Turpin', '\xa0&\xa0Douglas H Werner']}]",True,"['Qi Wu', 'Jeremiah P Turpin', 'Douglas H Werner']","Wu, Q., Turpin, J. & Werner, D.
