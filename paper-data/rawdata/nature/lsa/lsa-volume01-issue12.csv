original article,Memory-enhanced noiseless cross-phase modulation,"<p>Large nonlinearity at the single-photon level can pave the way for the implementation of universal quantum gates. However, realizing large and noiseless nonlinearity at such low light levels has been a great challenge for scientists in the past decade. Here, we propose a scheme that enables substantial nonlinear interaction between two light fields that are both stored in an atomic memory. Semiclassical and quantum simulations demonstrate the feasibility of achieving large cross-phase modulation (XPM) down to the single-photon level. The proposed scheme can be used to implement parity gates from which CNOT gates can be constructed. Furthermore, we present a proof of principle experimental demonstration of XPM between two optical pulses: one stored and one freely propagating through the memory medium.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Quantum Science, Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia', 'authors': ['Mahdi Hosseini', ',\xa0Stojan Rebić', ',\xa0Ben M Sparkes', ',\xa0Ben C Buchler', '\xa0&\xa0Ping K Lam']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics & Astronomy, Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia', 'authors': ['Stojan Rebić', '\xa0&\xa0Jason Twamley']}]",True,"['Mahdi Hosseini', 'Stojan Rebić', 'Ben M Sparkes', 'Jason Twamley', 'Ben C Buchler', 'Ping K Lam']","Hosseini, M., Rebić, S., Sparkes, B. et al.

original article,Ellipsometric determination of permittivity in a negative index photonic crystal metamaterial,"<p>In this work, we present the first experimental evidence of negative dielectric susceptibility in a two-dimensional silicon photonic crystal (PhC) with negative refractive index behavior. In the frequency range in which the effective refractive index n<sub>eff</sub> is equal to &#8722;1, the incident light couples efficiently to the guided modes in the top surface layer of the PhC metamaterial. These modes resemble surface plasmon polariton resonances. This finding was confirmed by ellipsometric measurements, demonstrating the isotropy of the PhC resonances. Such negative index PhC materials may be of use in biosensing applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Naples, Institute for microelectronics and microsystems, National Council of Research, Naples 80131, Italy', 'authors': ['Principia Dardano', ',\xa0Massimo Gagliardi', ',\xa0Ivo Rendina', '\xa0&\xa0Vito Mocella']}, {'address': 'Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Stefano Cabrini']}]",True,"['Principia Dardano', 'Massimo Gagliardi', 'Ivo Rendina', 'Stefano Cabrini', 'Vito Mocella']","Dardano, P., Gagliardi, M., Rendina, I. et al.
