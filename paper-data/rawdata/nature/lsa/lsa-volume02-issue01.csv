original article,Highly efficient GaAs solar cells by limiting light emission angle,"<p>In a conventional flat plate solar cell under direct sunlight, light is received from the solar disk, but is re-emitted isotropically. This isotropic emission corresponds to a significant entropy increase in the solar cell, with a corresponding drop in efficiency. Here, using a detailed balance model, we show that limiting the emission angle of a high-quality GaAs solar cell is a feasible route to achieving power conversion efficiencies above 38% with a single junction. The highest efficiencies are predicted for a thin, light trapping cell with an ideal back reflector, though the scheme is robust to a non-ideal back reflector. Comparison with a conventional planar cell geometry illustrates that limiting emission angle in a light trapping geometry not only allows for much thinner cells, but also for significantly higher overall efficiencies with an excellent rear reflector. Finally, we present ray-tracing and detailed balance analysis of two angular coupler designs, show that significant efficiency improvements are possible with these couplers, and demonstrate initial fabrication of one coupler design.</p>",[],True,"[""Emily D Kosten"", ""Jackson H Atwater"", ""James Parsons"", ""Albert Polman"", ""Harry A Atwater""]","Kosten, E., Atwater, J., Parsons, J. et al.

original article,Surface brightens up Si quantum dots: direct bandgap-like size-tunable emission,"<p>Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) constitute a perfect material for ink-jet printable large area displays, photovoltaics, light-emitting diode, bio-imaging luminescent markers and many other applications. For this purpose, efficient light emission/absorption and spectral tunability are necessary conditions. These are currently fulfilled by the direct bandgap materials. Si-QDs could offer the solution to major hurdles posed by these materials, namely, toxicity (e.g., Cd-, Pb- or As-based QDs), scarcity (e.g., QD with In, Se, Te) and/or instability. Here we show that by combining quantum confinement with dedicated surface engineering, the biggest drawback of Si&#8212;the indirect bandgap nature&#8212;can be overcome, and a &#8216;direct bandgap&#8217; variety of Si-QDs is created. We demonstrate this transformation on chemically synthesized Si-QDs using state-of-the-art optical spectroscopy and theoretical modelling. The carbon surface termination gives rise to drastic modification in electron and hole wavefunctions and radiative transitions between the lowest excited states of electron and hole attain &#8216;direct bandgap-like&#8217; (phonon-less) character. This results in efficient fast emission, tunable within the visible spectral range by QD size. These findings are fully justified within a tight-binding theoretical model. When the C surface termination is replaced by oxygen, the emission is converted into the well-known red luminescence, with microsecond decay and limited spectral tunability. In that way, the &#8216;direct bandgap&#8217; Si-QDs convert into the &#8216;traditional&#8217; indirect bandgap form, thoroughly investigated in the past.</p>",[],True,"[""Kate\u0159ina Dohnalov\u00e1"", ""Alexander N Poddubny"", ""Alexei A Prokofiev"", ""Wieteke DAM de Boer"", ""Chinnaswamy P Umesh"", ""Jos MJ Paulusse"", ""Han Zuilhof"", ""Tom Gregorkiewicz""]","Dohnalov√°, K., Poddubny, A., Prokofiev, A. et al.

original article,New yellow Ba0.93Eu0.07Al2O4 phosphor for warm-white light-emitting diodes through single-emitting-center conversion,"<p>Phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes for indoor illumination need to be warm-white (i.e., correlated color temperature &lt;4000&#160;K) with good color rendition (i.e., color rendering index &gt;80). However, no single-phosphor, single-emitting-center-converted white light-emitting diodes can simultaneously satisfy the color temperature and rendition requirements due to the lack of sufficient red spectral component in the phosphors&#8217; emission spectrum. Here, we report a new yellow Ba<sub>0.93</sub>Eu<sub>0.07</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> phosphor that has a new orthorhombic lattice structure and exhibits a broad yellow photoluminescence band with sufficient red spectral component. Warm-white emissions with correlated color temperature &lt;4000&#160;K and color rendering index &gt;80 were readily achieved when combining the Ba<sub>0.93</sub>Eu<sub>0.07</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> phosphor with a blue light-emitting diode (440&#8211;470&#160;nm). This study demonstrates that warm-white light-emitting diodes with high color rendition (i.e., color rendering index &gt;80) can be achieved based on single-phosphor, single-emitting-center conversion.</p>",[],True,"[""Xufan Li"", ""John D Budai"", ""Feng Liu"", ""Jane Y Howe"", ""Jiahua Zhang"", ""Xiao-Jun Wang"", ""Zhanjun Gu"", ""Chengjun Sun"", ""Richard S Meltzer"", ""Zhengwei Pan""]","Li, X., Budai, J., Liu, F. et al.
