original article,Efficient color routing with a dispersion-controlled waveguide array,"<p>Splitting white light into its constituent spectral components has been of interest ever since Newton first discovered the phenomenon of color separation. Many devices have since been conceived to achieve efficient wavelength separation, yet a large number of applications, e.g., in display technology, still use simple color absorption or rejection filters that absorb or reflect unwanted wavelengths, thus wasting luminous energy. Here, we demonstrate a novel microsized device concept that enables efficient color routing. The device operation is based on differential material dispersion in a waveguide array, which causes different wavelength signals to couple selectively into appropriate waveguides. A theoretical power delivery of greater than 50% for a tricolor wavelength router is obtained, compared to 33% expected from geometry alone. The principle of operation is demonstrated experimentally for a dual-color light field, where we achieve a higher than 70% routing efficiency (compared to 50% from geometry), thus highlighting the feasibility of this novel and promising approach.</p>",[],True,"[""Yi-Kun Liu"", ""Si-Cong Wang"", ""Yong-Yao Li"", ""Li-Yan Song"", ""Xiang-Sheng Xie"", ""Ming-Neng Feng"", ""Zhi-Ming Xiao"", ""Shao-Zhi Deng"", ""Jian-Ying Zhou"", ""Jun-Tao Li"", ""Kam Sing Wong"", ""Thomas F Krauss""]","Liu, YK., Wang, SC., Li, YY. et al.

original article,Radiation damping optical enhancement in cold atoms,"<p>The typically tiny effect of radiation damping on a moving body can be amplified to a favorable extent by exploiting the sharp reflectivity slope at one edge of an optically induced stop-band in atoms loaded into an optical lattice. In this paper, this phenomenon is demonstrated for the periodically trapped and coherently driven cold <sup>87</sup>Rb atoms, where radiation damping might be much larger than that anticipated in previous proposals and become comparable with radiation pressure. Such an enhancement could be observed even at speeds of only a few meters per second with less than 1.0% absorption, making radiation damping experimentally accessible.</p>",[],True,"[""Jin-Hui Wu"", ""SAR Horsley"", ""M Artoni"", ""GC La Rocca""]","Wu, JH., Horsley, S., Artoni, M. et al.
