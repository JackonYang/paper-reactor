original article,Liquid deposition photolithography for submicrometer resolution three-dimensional index structuring with large throughput,"<p>Photonic devices increasingly require three-dimensional control of refractive index, but existing fabrication methods such as femtosecond micromachining, multilayer lithography and bulk diffusion can only address a select scale range, are often limited in complexity or thickness and have low throughput. We introduce a new fabrication method and polymeric material that can efficiently create mm<sup>3</sup> optical devices with programmable, gradient index of refraction with arbitrary feature size. Index contrast of 0.1 is demonstrated, which is 100 times larger than femtosecond micromachining, and 20 times larger than commercial holographic photopolymers. This is achieved by repetitive microfluidic layering of a self-developing photopolymer structured by projection lithography. The process has the unusual property that total fabrication time for a fixed thickness decreases with the number of layers, enabling fabrication 10<sup>5</sup> faster than femtosecond micromachining. We demonstrate the process by sequentially writing 100 layers to fabricate a mm thick waveguide array.</p>",[],True,"[""Adam C Urness"", ""Eric D Moore"", ""Keith K Kamysiak"", ""Michael C Cole"", ""Robert R McLeod""]","Urness, A., Moore, E., Kamysiak, K. et al.

original article,The simplest route to generating a train of attosecond pulses,<p>We report on two novel routes to generating a train of attosecond pulses from a broad discrete spectrum in the near-infrared&#8211;visible&#8211;ultraviolet range. One extends an integer-temporal-Talbot (ITT) concept to include high-order spectral dispersions and generates a pulse train that completely satisfies the transform-limited condition. The other numerically explores the optimum conditions under which we can obtain an attosecond pulse train that approximately satisfies the transform-limited condition. The second method is more practical than the first. Either of these methods is extremely simple and robust; we need only to place a few thin dispersive materials in the optical path and to adjust their thicknesses without spatially dispersing the frequency components. We numerically demonstrate the generation of a train of attosecond pulses with a transform-limited pulse duration of 728&#160;as and a repetition period of 8.03&#160;fs in gaseous parahydrogen.</p>,[],True,"[""Kazumichi Yoshii"", ""John Kiran Anthony"", ""Masayuki Katsuragawa""]","Yoshii, K., Kiran Anthony, J. & Katsuragawa, M.

original article,Mode splitting transmission effect of surface wave excitation through a metal hole array,"<p>The resonant frequencies of the excited surface waves on a metal hole array with respect to the incident angle were studied in the terahertz region. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the resonant peak of surface wave excitation splits into two when transmitted through a metal hole array off-normally. The high-order mode with resonant frequency above the cutoff frequency f<sub>c</sub> (plasma frequency effect) has a shorter attenuation length than that of the low-order mode whose resonant frequency is below f<sub>c</sub>. The reason is that the high-order mode is a coupled mode consisting of surface wave and hole modes, while the low-order mode is just an excited surface wave (which can be considered as the spoof surface plasmons). Our investigation may open a door to distinguish the spoof surface plasmons and the coupled modes of surface waves and hole modes.</p>",[],True,"[""Lin Chen"", ""Yiming Zhu"", ""Xiaofei Zang"", ""Bin Cai"", ""Zhou Li"", ""Le Xie"", ""Songlin Zhuang""]","Chen, L., Zhu, Y., Zang, X. et al.

original article,Helicity dependent directional surface plasmon polariton excitation using a metasurface with interfacial phase discontinuity,"<p>Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) have been widely exploited in various scientific communities, ranging from physics, chemistry to biology, due to the strong confinement of light to the metal surface. For many applications, it is important that the free space photon can be coupled to SPPs in a controllable manner. In this Letter, we apply the concept of interfacial phase discontinuity for circularly polarizations on a metasurface to the design of a novel type of polarization-dependent SPP unidirectional excitation at normal incidence. Selective unidirectional excitation of SPPs along opposite directions is experimentally demonstrated at optical frequencies by simply switching the helicity of the incident light. This approach, in conjunction with dynamic polarization modulation techniques, opens gateway towards integrated plasmonic circuits with electrically reconfigurable functionalities.</p>",[],True,"[""Lingling Huang"", ""Xianzhong Chen"", ""Benfeng Bai"", ""Qiaofeng Tan"", ""Guofan Jin"", ""Thomas Zentgraf"", ""Shuang Zhang""]","Huang, L., Chen, X., Bai, B. et al.
