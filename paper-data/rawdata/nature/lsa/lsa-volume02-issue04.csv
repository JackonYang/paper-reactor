original article,Real-time detection of influenza A virus using semiconductor nanophotonics,"<p>Modern miniaturization and the digitalization of characterization instruments greatly facilitate the diffusion of technological advances in new fields and generate innovative applications. The concept of a portable, inexpensive and semi-automated biosensing platform, or lab-on-a-chip, is a vision shared by many researchers and venture industries. Under this scope, we present a semiconductor monolithic integration approach to conduct surface plasmon resonance studies. This technology is already commonly used for biochemical characterization in pharmaceutical industries, but we have reduced the technological platform to a few nanometers in scale on a semiconductor chip. We evaluate the signal quality of this nanophotonic device using hyperspectral-imaging technology, and we compare its performance with that of a standard prism-based commercial system. Two standard biochemical agents are employed for this characterization study: bovine serum albumin and inactivated influenza A virus. Time resolutions of data acquisition varying between 360 and 2.2&#160;s are presented, yielding 2.7&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>&#8211;1.5&#215;10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> RIU resolutions, respectively.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Laboratory for Quantum Semiconductors and Photon-based BioNanotechnology, Interdisciplinary Institute for Technological Innovation (3IT), Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC J1K 2R1, Canada', 'authors': ['Dominic Lepage', ',\xa0Alvaro Jiménez', ',\xa0Jacques Beauvais', '\xa0&\xa0Jan J Dubowski']}]",True,"['Dominic Lepage', 'Alvaro Jiménez', 'Jacques Beauvais', 'Jan J Dubowski']","Lepage, D., Jiménez, A., Beauvais, J. et al.

original article,Giant resonant light forces in microspherical photonics,"<p>Resonant light pressure effects can open new degrees of freedom in optical manipulation with microparticles, but they have been traditionally considered as relatively subtle effects. Using a simplified two-dimensional model of surface electromagnetic waves evanescently coupled to whispering gallery modes (WGMs) in transparent circular cavities, we show that under resonant conditions the peaks of the optical forces can approach theoretical limits imposed by the momentum conservation law on totally absorbing particles. Experimentally, we proved the existence of strong peaks of the optical forces by studying the optical propulsion of dielectric microspheres along tapered microfibers. We observed giant optical propelling velocities &#8764;0.45 mm s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for some of the 15-20 &#181;m polystyrene microspheres in water for guided powers limited at &#8764;43 mW. Such velocities exceed previous observations by more than an order of magnitude, thereby providing evidence for the strongly enhanced resonant optical forces. We analyzed the statistical properties of the velocity distribution function measured for slightly disordered (&#8764;1% size variations) ensembles of microspheres with mean diameters varying from 3 to 20 &#181;m. These results demonstrate a principal possibility of optical sorting of microspheres with the positions of WGM resonances overlapped at the wavelength of the laser source. They can be used as building blocks of the lossless coupled resonator optical waveguides and various integrated optoelectronics devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Optical Science, Center for Optoelectronics and Optical Communication, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223-0001, USA', 'authors': ['Yangcheng Li', ',\xa0Oleksiy V Svitelskiy', '\xa0&\xa0Vasily N Astratov']}, {'address': 'Department of Radiophysics, University of Nizhny Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod 603950, Russia', 'authors': ['Alexey V Maslov']}, {'address': 'Photonics and Nanoscience Group, School of Electrical Engineering and Physics, University of Dundee, Nethergate, Dundee DD1 4HN, UK', 'authors': ['David Carnegie', '\xa0&\xa0Edik Rafailov']}]",True,"['Yangcheng Li', 'Oleksiy V Svitelskiy', 'Alexey V Maslov', 'David Carnegie', 'Edik Rafailov', 'Vasily N Astratov']","Li, Y., Svitelskiy, O., Maslov, A. et al.

original article,"Ultra-thin, planar, Babinet-inverted plasmonic metalenses","<p>We experimentally demonstrate the focusing of visible light with ultra-thin, planar metasurfaces made of concentrically perforated, 30-nm-thick gold films. The perforated nano-voids&#8212;Babinet-inverted (complementary) nano-antennas&#8212;create discrete phase shifts and form a desired wavefront of cross-polarized, scattered light. The signal-to-noise ratio in our complementary nano-antenna design is at least one order of magnitude higher than in previous metallic nano-antenna designs. We first study our proof-of-concept &#8216;metalens&#8217; with extremely strong focusing ability: focusing at a distance of only 2.5&#160;&#956;m is achieved experimentally with a 4-&#956;m-diameter lens for light at a wavelength of 676&#160;nm. We then extend our work with one of these &#8216;metalenses&#8217; and achieve a wavelength-controllable focal length. Optical characterization of the lens confirms that switching the incident wavelength from 676 to 476&#160;nm changes the focal length from 7 to 10&#160;&#181;m, which opens up new opportunities for tuning and spatially separating light at different wavelengths within small, micrometer-scale areas. All the proposed designs can be embedded on-chip or at the end of an optical fiber. The designs also all work for two orthogonal, linear polarizations of incident light.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA', 'authors': ['Xingjie Ni', ',\xa0Satoshi Ishii', ',\xa0Alexander V Kildishev', '\xa0&\xa0Vladimir M Shalaev']}]",True,"['Xingjie Ni', 'Satoshi Ishii', 'Alexander V Kildishev', 'Vladimir M Shalaev']","Ni, X., Ishii, S., Kildishev, A. et al.
