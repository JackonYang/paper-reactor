original article,Plasmonics for solid-state lighting: enhanced excitation and directional emission of highly efficient light sources,"<p>Light sources based on reliable and energy-efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are instrumental in the development of solid-state lighting (SSL). Most research efforts in SSL have focused on improving both the intrinsic quantum efficiency (QE) and the stability of light emitters. For this reason, it is broadly accepted that with the advent of highly efficient (QE close to 1) and stable emitters, the fundamental research phase of SSL is coming to an end. In this study, we demonstrate a very large improvement in SSL emission (above 70-fold directional enhancement for p-polarized emission and 60-fold enhancement for unpolarized emission) using nanophotonic structures. This is attained by coupling emitters with very high QE to collective plasmonic resonances in periodic arrays of aluminum nanoantennas. Our results open a new path for fundamental and applied research in SSL in which plasmonic nanostructures are able to mold the spectral and angular distribution of the emission with unprecedented precision.</p>",[],True,"[""Gabriel Lozano"", ""Davy J Louwers"", ""Said RK Rodr\u00edguez"", ""Shunsuke Murai"", ""Olaf TA Jansen"", ""Marc A Verschuuren"", ""Jaime G\u00f3mez Rivas""]","Lozano, G., Louwers, D., Rodr√≠guez, S. et al.

original article,Laser patterning for the study of MSC cardiogenic differentiation at the single-cell level,"<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been cited as contributors to heart repair through cardiogenic differentiation and multiple cellular interactions, including the paracrine effect, cell fusion, and mechanical and electrical couplings. Due to heart&#8211;muscle complexity, progress in the development of knowledge concerning the role of MSCs in cardiac repair is heavily based on MSC&#8211;cardiomyocyte coculture. In conventional coculture systems, however, the in vivo cardiac muscle structure, in which rod-shaped cells are connected end-to-end, is not sustained; instead, irregularly shaped cells spread randomly, resulting in randomly distributed cell junctions. Consequently, contact-mediated cell&#8211;cell interactions (e.g., the electrical triggering signal and the mechanical contraction wave that propagate through MSC&#8211;cardiomyocyte junctions) occur randomly. Thus, the data generated on the beneficial effects of MSCs may be irrelevant to in vivo biological processes. In this study, we explored whether cardiomyocyte alignment, the most important phenotype, is relevant to stem cell cardiogenic differentiation. Here, we report (i) the construction of a laser-patterned, biochip-based, stem cell&#8211;cardiomyocyte coculture model with controlled cell alignment; and (ii) single-cell-level data on stem cell cardiogenic differentiation under in vivo-like cardiomyocyte alignment conditions.</p>",[],True,"[""Zhen Ma"", ""Qiuying Liu"", ""Huaxiao Yang"", ""Raymond B Runyan"", ""Carol A Eisenberg"", ""Meifeng Xu"", ""Thomas K Borg"", ""Roger Markwald"", ""Yifei Wang"", ""Bruce Z Gao""]","Ma, Z., Liu, Q., Yang, H. et al.

original article,Polymeric photonic molecule super-mode lasers on silicon,"<p>Optically coupled microcavities have emerged as photonic structures with promising properties for investigation of fundamental science as well as for applications. We report on the fabrication and spatially resolved spectroscopy of on-chip photonic molecule (PM) lasers consisting of two coupled, dye-doped polymeric microdisks on a silicon substrate. We investigate the fundamental lasing properties with focus on the spatial distribution of modes, the coupling dependent suppression of lasing modes, and in particular the application-oriented operation of these devices in aqueous environments. By depositing an additional polymer layer onto the lithographically structured cavities made of dye-doped poly(methyl methacrylate), coupling-gap widths below 150 nm with aspect ratios of the micro-/nanostructure exceeding 9&#8758;1 are achieved. This enables strong optical coupling at visible wavelengths despite relatively small resonator radii of 25 &#181;m. The lasing properties of dye-doped PMs are investigated using spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence (&#956;-PL) spectroscopy. This technique allows for the direct imaging of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) in the photonics molecules. For subwavelength coupling gaps, we observe lasing from delocalized eigenstates of the PMs (termed in the following as super-modes). Using size-mismatched cavities, the lasing mode suppression for different coupling-gap widths is investigated. We further demonstrate single-mode lasing operation in aqueous environments with PMs, which are realized on a low-cost, polymer-on-silicon platform.</p>",[],True,"[""Tobias Grossmann"", ""Tobias Wienhold"", ""Uwe Bog"", ""Torsten Beck"", ""Christian Friedmann"", ""Heinz Kalt"", ""Timo Mappes""]","Grossmann, T., Wienhold, T., Bog, U. et al.
