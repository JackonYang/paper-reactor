original article,"A systematic study on efficiency enhancements in phosphorescent green, red and blue microcavity organic light emitting devices","<p>A systematic study has been conducted on microcavity organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on green, red and blue phosphorescent emitters to elucidate the microcavity effects for different color emitters. We found that the luminance output is determined by the reflectivity of the semitransparent electrode and the photopic response of the green, red and blue emitters. While the luminance enhancements of blue and red phosphorescent microcavity devices are small, a current efficiency as high as 224&#160;cd A<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is obtained in the green phosphorescent microcavity OLEDs.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-6400, USA', 'authors': ['Chaoyu Xiang', ',\xa0Wonhoe Koo', '\xa0&\xa0Franky So']}, {'address': 'Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, Yamagata University, Yamagata 992-8510, Japan', 'authors': ['Hisahiro Sasabe', '\xa0&\xa0Junji Kido']}]",True,"['Chaoyu Xiang', 'Wonhoe Koo', 'Franky So', 'Hisahiro Sasabe', 'Junji Kido']","Xiang, C., Koo, W., So, F. et al.A systematic study on efficiency enhancements in phosphorescent green, red and blue microcavity organic light emitting devices.

original article,The effect of an electric field on the thermomechanical damage of nodular defects in dielectric multilayer coatings irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses,"<p>Thermomechanical damage of nodules in dielectric multilayer coatings that are irradiated by nanosecond laser pulses has been interpreted with respect to mechanical properties and electric-field enhancement. However, the effect of electric-field enhancement in nodular damage, especially the influence of electric-field distributions, has never been directly demonstrated through experimental results, which prevents the achievement of a clear understanding of the damage process of nodular defects. Here, a systematic and comparative study was designed to reveal how electric-field distributions affect the damage behavior of nodules. To obtain reliable results, two series of artificial nodules with different geometries and film absorption characteristics were prepared from monodisperse silica microspheres. After establishing simplified geometrical models of the nodules, the electric-field enhancement was simulated using a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain code. Then, the damage morphologies of the artificial nodules were directly compared with the simulated electric-field intensity profiles. For both series of nodules, the damage morphologies reproduced our simulated electric-field intensity distributions very well. These results indicated that the electric-field distribution was actually a bridge that connected the nodular mechanical properties to the final thermomechanical damage. Understanding of the damage mechanism of nodules was deepened by obtaining data on the influence of electric-field distributions on the damage behavior of nodules.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Key Laboratory of Advanced Micro-Structure Materials, Ministry of Education, Shanghai 200092, China', 'authors': ['Xinbin Cheng', ',\xa0Jinlong Zhang', ',\xa0Tao Ding', ',\xa0Zeyong Wei', ',\xa0Hongqiang Li', '\xa0&\xa0Zhanshan Wang']}, {'address': 'Institute of Precision Optical Engineering, School of Physics Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China', 'authors': ['Xinbin Cheng', ',\xa0Jinlong Zhang', ',\xa0Tao Ding', '\xa0&\xa0Zhanshan Wang']}]",True,"['Xinbin Cheng', 'Jinlong Zhang', 'Tao Ding', 'Zeyong Wei', 'Hongqiang Li', 'Zhanshan Wang']","Cheng, X., Zhang, J., Ding, T. et al.

review,Strong light–matter interaction in ZnO microcavities,"<p>The strong light&#8211;matter interaction in ZnO-embedded microcavities has received great attention in recent years, due to its ability to generate the robust bosonic quasiparticles, exciton-polaritons, at or above room temperature. This review introduces the strong coupling effect in ZnO-based microcavities and describes the recent progress in this field. In addition, the report contains a systematic analysis of the room-temperature strong-coupling effects from relaxation to polariton lasing. The stable room temperature operation of polaritonic effects in a ZnO microcavity promises a wide range of practical applications in the future, such as ultra-low power consumption coherent light emitters in the ultraviolet region, polaritonic transport, and other fundamental of quantum optics in solid-state systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Photonics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu 300', 'authors': ['Ying-Yu Lai', ',\xa0Yu-Pin Lan', '\xa0&\xa0Tien-Chang Lu']}]",True,"['Ying-Yu Lai', 'Yu-Pin Lan', 'Tien-Chang Lu']","Lai, Y., Lan, Y. & Lu, T.
