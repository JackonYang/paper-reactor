original article,The magnetic response of graphene split-ring metamaterials,"<p>Graphene has emerged as a promising platform for THz plasmonics, allowing high confinement, long lifetimes and fast electrical tunability. Here, we predict a strong magnetic dipole response by graphene split nanorings at THz frequencies, allowing the attainment of metamaterials with a high degree of field confinement (approximately one hundredth of the excitation wavelength) that is not reachable with conventional noble metals. The magnetic response of highly doped graphene split-rings in the far-infrared is much stronger than that displayed by gold structures of similar thicknesses. We further explored stacked graphene layers as a practical way of producing high-frequency magnetism in thin, electrically tunable metamaterials. Our results support the great potential of using graphene to achieve electrically tunable magnetic metamaterials.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre and Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK', 'authors': ['Nikitas Papasimakis', ',\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev', '\xa0&\xa0FJ García de Abajo']}, {'address': 'IQFR – CSIC, Serrano 119, 28006, Madrid, Spain', 'authors': ['Sukosin Thongrattanasiri', '\xa0&\xa0FJ García de Abajo']}, {'address': 'Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore', 'authors': ['Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'ICFO–Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, 08860 Castelldefels (Barcelona), Spain', 'authors': ['FJ García de Abajo']}]",True,"['Nikitas Papasimakis', 'Sukosin Thongrattanasiri', 'Nikolay I Zheludev', 'FJ García de Abajo']","Papasimakis, N., Thongrattanasiri, S., Zheludev, N. et al.

original article,Bloch surface eigenstates within the radiation continuum,"<p>From detailed numerical calculations, we demonstrate that in simple photonic crystal structures, a discrete number of Bloch surface-localized eigenstates can exist inside the continuum of free-space modes. Coupling to the free space causes the surface modes to leak, but the forward and back-reflected leakage may interfere destructively to create a perfectly bound surface state with zero leakage. We perform analytical temporal coupled-mode theory analysis to show the generality of such phenomenon and its robustness from variations of system parameters. Periodicity, time-reversal invariance, two-fold rotational symmetry and a perfectly reflecting boundary are necessary for these unique states.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA', 'authors': ['Chia Wei Hsu', ',\xa0Bo Zhen', ',\xa0Song-Liang Chua', ',\xa0Steven G Johnson', ',\xa0John D Joannopoulos', '\xa0&\xa0Marin Soljačić']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA', 'authors': ['Chia Wei Hsu']}, {'address': 'Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA', 'authors': ['Steven G Johnson']}]",True,"['Chia Wei Hsu', 'Bo Zhen', 'Song-Liang Chua', 'Steven G Johnson', 'John D Joannopoulos', 'Marin Soljačić']","Hsu, C., Zhen, B., Chua, S. et al.

original article,High-resolution 1D moirés as counterfeit security features,"<p>A moir&#233; is an interference pattern that appears when two different periodic structures are overlaid. The image created is extremely sensitive to small variations in the original layers and is thus very interesting for anti-counterfeit protection. We present a microfabricated 1D moir&#233; enabling complex high-resolution patterns as a significantly improved security feature that cannot be reproduced using standard printing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, that a microscopic deviation from the original design results in a macroscopic variation in the moir&#233; that is clearly visible to the naked eye. The record resolution achieved in the elements fabricated and the increased design freedom, make these high-resolution moir&#233;s excellent candidates for a variety of visually appealing security applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Microsystems laboratory, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne 1015, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Victor J Cadarso', ',\xa0Katrin Sidler', '\xa0&\xa0Jürgen Brugger']}, {'address': 'Peripheral Systems Laboratory, EPFL, Lausanne 1015, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Sylvain Chosson', '\xa0&\xa0Roger D Hersch']}]",True,"['Victor J Cadarso', 'Sylvain Chosson', 'Katrin Sidler', 'Roger D Hersch', 'Jürgen Brugger']","Cadarso, V., Chosson, S., Sidler, K. et al.
