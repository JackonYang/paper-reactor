original article,Non-locality and collective emission in disordered lasing resonators,"<p>Random lasing is observed in optically active resonators in the presence of disorder. As the optical cavities involved are open, the modes are coupled, and energy may pour from one state to another provided that they are spatially overlapping. Although the electromagnetic modes are spatially localized, our system may be actively switched to a collective state, presenting a novel form of non-locality revealed by a high degree of spectral correlation between the light emissions collected at distant positions. In a nutshell, light may be stored in a disordered nonlinear structure in different fashions that strongly differ in their spatial properties. This effect is experimentally demonstrated and theoretically explained in titania clusters embedded in a dye, and it provides clear evidence of a transition to a multimodal collective emission involving the entire spatial extent of the disordered system. Our results can be used to develop a novel type of miniaturized, actively controlled all-optical chip.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ISC-CNR, UOS Sapienza, 00185 Roma, Italy', 'authors': ['Marco Leonetti', '\xa0&\xa0Claudio Conti']}, {'address': 'Institute for Material Science Madrid (ICMM-CSIC), 28049 Madrid, Spain', 'authors': ['Marco Leonetti', '\xa0&\xa0Cefe Lopez']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University Sapienza, I-00185 Roma, Italy', 'authors': ['Claudio Conti']}]",True,"['Marco Leonetti', 'Claudio Conti', 'Cefe Lopez']","Leonetti, M., Conti, C. & Lopez, C.

original article,Light spectral filtering based on spatial adiabatic passage,"<p>We present the first experimental realization of a light spectral filter based on the spatial adiabatic passage technique. We demonstrate that a fully integrable CMOS-compatible system of three coupled identical total internal reflection silicon oxide waveguides with variable separation along their propagation direction can be used simultaneously as a low- and high-pass spectral filter within the visible range of wavelengths. Light is injected into the right waveguide, and after propagating along the system, long wavelengths are transferred into the left output, whereas short wavelengths propagate to the right and central outputs. The stopband reaches values up to &#8722;11&#160;dB for the left output and approximately &#8722;20&#160;dB for the right plus central outputs. The passband values are close to 0&#160;dB for both cases. We also demonstrate that the filtering characteristics of the device can be controlled by modifying the parameter values, which define the geometry of the triple-waveguide system. However, the general filtering behavior of the system does not critically depend on technological variations. Thus, the spatial adiabatic passage filtering approach constitutes an alternative to other integrated filtering devices, such as interference or absorbance-based filters.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, E-08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Ricard Menchon-Enrich', ',\xa0Jordi Mompart', '\xa0&\xa0Veronica Ahufinger']}, {'address': 'Chemical Transducers Group, Institut de Microelectrònica de Barcelona (IMB-CNM, CSIC), E-08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Andreu Llobera', '\xa0&\xa0Jordi Vila-Planas']}, {'address': 'Microsystems Laboratory (LMIS1), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Víctor J Cadarso']}]",True,"['Ricard Menchon-Enrich', 'Andreu Llobera', 'Jordi Vila-Planas', 'Víctor J Cadarso', 'Jordi Mompart', 'Veronica Ahufinger']","Menchon-Enrich, R., Llobera, A., Vila-Planas, J. et al.

original article,Exceeding the limit of plasmonic light trapping in textured screen-printed solar cells using Al nanoparticles and wrinkle-like graphene sheets,"<p>The solar cell market is predominantly based on textured screen-printed solar cells. Due to parasitic absorption in nanostructures, using plasmonic processes to obtain an enhancement that exceeds 2.5% of the short-circuit photocurrent density is challenging. In this paper, a 7.2% enhancement in the photocurrent density can be achieved through the integration of plasmonic Al nanoparticles and wrinkle-like graphene sheets. For the first time, we experimentally achieve Al nanoparticle-enhanced solar cells. An innovative thermal evaporation method is proposed to fabricate low-coverage Al nanoparticle arrays on solar cells. Due to the ultraviolet (UV) plasmon resonance of Al nanoparticles, the performance enhancement of the solar cells is significantly greater than that from Ag nanoparticles. Subsequently, we deposit wrinkle-like graphene sheets over the Al nanoparticle-enhanced solar cells. Compared with planar graphene sheets, the bend carbon layer also exhibits a broadband light-trapping effect. Our results exceed the limit of plasmonic light trapping in textured screen-printed silicon solar cells.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Centre for Micro-Photonics, Faculty of Engineering and Industrial Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Victoria 3122, Australia', 'authors': ['Xi Chen', ',\xa0Baohua Jia', ',\xa0Yinan Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Min Gu']}]",True,"['Xi Chen', 'Baohua Jia', 'Yinan Zhang', 'Min Gu']","Chen, X., Jia, B., Zhang, Y. et al.

original article,Silicon micromirrors with three-dimensional curvature enabling lensless efficient coupling of free-space light,"<p>Miniaturized optical benches process free-space light propagating in-plane with respect to the substrate and have a large variety of applications, including the coupling of light through an optical fiber. High coupling efficiency is usually obtained using assembled micro-optical parts, which considerably increase the system cost and integration effort. In this work, we report a high coupling efficiency, monolithically integrated silicon micromirror with controlled three-dimensional (3D) curvature that is capable of manipulating optical beams propagating in the plane of the silicon substrate. Based on our theoretical modeling, a spherical micromirror with a microscale radius of curvature as small as twice the Gaussian beam Rayleigh range provides a 100% coupling efficiency over a relatively long optical path range. Introducing dimensionless parameters facilitates the elucidation of the role of key design parameters, including the mirror's radii of curvature, independent of the wavelength. A micromachining method is presented for fabricating the 3D micromirror using fluorinated gas plasmas. The measured coupling efficiency was greater than 50% over a 200-&#956;m optical path, compared to less than 10% afforded by a conventional flat micromirror, which was in good agreement with the model. Using the 3D micromirror, an optical cavity was formed with a round-trip diffraction loss of less than 0.4%, resulting in one order of magnitude enhancement in the measured quality factor. A nearly 100% coupling was also estimated when matching the sagittal and tangential radii of curvature of the presented micromirror&#8217;s surface. The reported class of 3D micromirrors may be an advantageous replacement for the optical lenses usually assembled in silicon photonics and optical benches by transforming them into real 3D monolithic systems while achieving wideband high coupling efficiency over submillimeter distances.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Université Paris-Est, ESYCOM (EA 2552), ESIEE Paris, F-93162 Noisy-le-Grand, France', 'authors': ['Yasser M Sabry', '\xa0&\xa0Tarik Bourouina']}, {'address': 'Si-Ware Systems, 3 Khaled Ibn El-Waleed Street, Heliopolis, Cairo 11361, Egypt', 'authors': ['Yasser M Sabry', ',\xa0Bassam Saadany', ',\xa0Diaa Khalil', '\xa0&\xa0Tarik Bourouina']}, {'address': 'Electron. and Comm.
