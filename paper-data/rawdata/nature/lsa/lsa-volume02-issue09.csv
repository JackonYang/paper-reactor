original article,Elastomeric lenses with tunable astigmatism,"<p>Microlenses fabricated using flexible elastomers can be tuned in focal length by application of controlled strain. By varying the strain azimuthally, the lenses may be deformed asymmetrically such that aberrations may be controlled. This approach is used to tune the astigmatism of the tunable lenses, and it is shown that the generated wavefront may be accurately controlled. The lens presented here has an initial focal length of 32.6&#160;mm and a tuning range of +2.3&#160;mm for approximately 10% applied strain. The range of directly tunable Zernike polynomials representing astigmatism is about 3&#160;&#181;m, while the secondary lens errors, which cannot be tuned directly, vary only by about 0.2&#160;&#181;m.</p>",[],True,"[""Peter Liebetraut"", ""Sebastian Petsch"", ""Jens Liebeskind"", ""Hans Zappe""]","Liebetraut, P., Petsch, S., Liebeskind, J. et al.

original article,Quantifying the refractive index dispersion of a pigmented biological tissue using Jamin–Lebedeff interference microscopy,"<p>Jamin&#8211;Lebedeff polarizing interference microscopy is a classical method for determining the refractive index and thickness of transparent tissues. Here, we extend the application of this method to pigmented, absorbing biological tissues, based on a theoretical derivation using Jones calculus. This novel method is applied to the wings of the American Rubyspot damselfly, Hetaerina americana. The membranes in the red-colored parts of the damselfly&#8217;s wings, with a thickness of &#8764;2.5 &#181;m, contain a pigment with maximal absorption at &#8764;490 nm and a peak absorbance coefficient of &#8764;0.7 &#181;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The high pigment density causes a considerable and anomalous dispersion of the refractive index. This result can be quantitatively understood from the pigment absorbance spectrum by applying the Kramers&#8211;Kronig dispersion relations. Measurements of the spectral dependence of the refractive index and the absorption are valuable for gaining quantitative insight into how the material properties of animal tissues influence coloration.</p>",[],True,"[""Doekele G Stavenga"", ""Hein L Leertouwer"", ""Bodo D Wilts""]","Stavenga, D., Leertouwer, H. & Wilts, B.

original article,Label-free super-resolution imaging of adenoviruses by submerged microsphere optical nanoscopy,"<p>Because of the small sizes of most viruses (typically 5&#8211;150&#160;nm), standard optical microscopes, which have an optical diffraction limit of 200&#160;nm, are not generally suitable for their direct observation. Electron microscopes usually require specimens to be placed under vacuum conditions, thus making them unsuitable for imaging live biological specimens in liquid environments. Indirect optical imaging of viruses has been made possible by the use of fluorescence optical microscopy that relies on the stimulated emission of light from the fluorescing specimens when they are excited with light of a specific wavelength, a process known as labeling or self-fluorescent emissions from certain organic materials. In this paper, we describe direct white-light optical imaging of 75-nm adenoviruses by submerged microsphere optical nanoscopy (SMON) without the use of fluorescent labeling or staining. The mechanism involved in the imaging is presented. Theoretical calculations of the imaging planes and the magnification factors have been verified by experimental results, with good agreement between theory and experiment.</p>",[],True,"[""Lin Li"", ""Wei Guo"", ""Yinzhou Yan"", ""Seoungjun Lee"", ""Tao Wang""]","Li, L., Guo, W., Yan, Y. et al.
