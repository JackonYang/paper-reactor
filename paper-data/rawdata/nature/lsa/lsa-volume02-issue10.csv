review,Functionalized polymer nanofibers: a versatile platform for manipulating light at the nanoscale,"<p>As an organic optical fiber with a diameter comparable to or less than the wavelength of light, polymer nanofibers have been attracting increasing attention as a platform for manipulating light at the nanoscale. A variety of applications for polymer optical nanofibers, including waveguides, light sources and sensors, have been reported in recent years. In this article, the recent progress in the field of polymer optical nanofibers is reviewed in terms of their fabrication, characterization and applications. In particular, we focus on functionalized polymer nanofibers doped with functional materials, such as dye molecules, noble metal nanoparticles, quantum dots and rare earth ions, which greatly expand their capabilities of generating, propagating, converting and modulating light at the nanoscale.</p>",[],True,"[""Pan Wang"", ""Yipei Wang"", ""Limin Tong""]","Wang, P., Wang, Y. & Tong, L.

review,From microscopy to nanoscopy via visible light,"<p>The resolution of conventional optical equipment is always restricted by the diffraction limit, and improving on this was previously considered improbable. Optical super-resolution imaging, which has recently experienced rapid growth and attracted increasing global interest, will result in applications in many domains, benefiting fields such as biology, medicine and material research. This review discusses the contributions of different researchers who identified the diffractive barrier and attempted to realize optical super-resolution. This is followed by a personal viewpoint of the development of optical nanoscopy in recent decades and the road towards the next generation of optical nanoscopy.</p>",[],True,"[""Xiang Hao"", ""Cuifang Kuang"", ""Zhaotai Gu"", ""Yifan Wang"", ""Shuai Li"", ""Yulong Ku"", ""Yanghui Li"", ""Jianhong Ge"", ""Xu Liu""]","Hao, X., Kuang, C., Gu, Z. et al.

original article,Improving metal reflectors by suppressing surface plasmon polaritons: a priori calculation of the internal reflectance of a solar cell,"<p>Imperfect internal reflectance of near-bandgap light reduces the performance of all solar cells, and becomes increasingly detrimental as absorbers become thinner. We consider light incident on the silicon/dielectric/metal structure at the back of rear-passivated crystalline silicon solar cells with surface textures that are large enough for geometric optics. By calculating the absorbance in the metal as a function of the angle of incidence, we discover three results that are important for understanding and improving rear reflectors in many types of solar cells. First, significant parasitic absorption occurs in the metal layer in two cases: s- and p-polarized propagating modes (near-normal angles of incidence) when the dielectric thickness is adjusted to cause destructive interference of the reflected beams, and p-polarized evanescent modes (angles of incidence above the semiconductor/dielectric critical angle) that excite surface plasmon polaritons at the metal surface. Second, the latter loss dominates; a well-designed rear dielectric passivation layer must suppress the penetration of evanescent waves to the metal. Third, when used as an input in a simple analytical model, the average rear internal reflectance calculated by assuming a Lambertian angular distribution of light accurately predicts the total reflectance and absorbance of a solar cell.</p>",[],True,"[""Zachary C Holman"", ""Stefaan De Wolf"", ""Christophe Ballif""]","Holman, Z., De Wolf, S. & Ballif, C.
