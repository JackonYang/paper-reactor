original article,Cavity optomechanics on a microfluidic resonator with water and viscous liquids,"<p>Currently, optical or mechanical resonances are commonly used in microfluidic research. However, optomechanical oscillations by light pressure were not shown with liquids. This is because replacing the surrounding air with water inherently increases the acoustical impedance and hence, the associated acoustical radiation losses. Here, we bridge between microfluidics and optomechanics by fabricating a hollow-bubble resonator with liquid inside and optically exciting vibrations with 100&#160;MHz rates using only mW optical-input power. This constitutes the first time that any microfluidic system is optomechanically actuated. We further prove the feasibility of microfluidic optomechanics on liquids by demonstrating vibrations on organic fluids with viscous dissipation higher than blood viscosity while measuring density changes in the liquid via the vibration frequency shift. Our device will enable using cavity optomechanics for studying non-solid phases of matter, while light is easily coupled from the outer dry side of the capillary and fluid is provided using a standard syringe pump.</p>",[],True,"[""Kyu Hyun Kim"", ""Gaurav Bahl"", ""Wonsuk Lee"", ""Jing Liu"", ""Matthew Tomes"", ""Xudong Fan"", ""Tal Carmon""]","Hyun Kim, K., Bahl, G., Lee, W. et al.

original article,Remotely excited Raman optical activity using chiral plasmon propagation in Ag nanowires,"<p>We experimentally investigated remotely excited Raman optical activity (ROA) using propagating surface plasmons in chiral Ag nanowires. Using chiral fmoc-glycyl-glycine-OH (FGGO) molecules, we first studied the local surface plasmon-enhanced ROA. We found that the Raman intensity can be excited by left- and right-circularly polarized lights and that the circular intensity difference (CID) can be significantly enhanced. Second, by selecting vibrational modes with large Raman and ROA intensities that are not influenced by chemical enhancements, we studied remotely excited ROA imaging and the CID of FGGO molecules by propagating a plasmonic waveguide using Ag chiral nanostructures. When laser light was radiated on one of the Ag terminals, the measured CID of the FGG at the other terminal showed little change compared to the local excited CID. Meanwhile, when the laser light was radiated on the Ag nanowires (not on the terminals) and was coupled to the nearby nanoantenna, the CID of the ROA could be manipulated by altering the coupling angle between the Ag nanowires. To directly demonstrate the propagation of ROA along the nanowire and its remote detection, we also measured the remotely excited ROA spectra. Our experimental method has the potential to remotely determine the chirality of molecular structures and the absolute configuration or conformation of a chiral live cell.</p>",[],True,"[""Mengtao Sun"", ""Zhenglong Zhang"", ""Peijie Wang"", ""Qiang Li"", ""Fengcai Ma"", ""Hongxing Xu""]","Sun, M., Zhang, Z., Wang, P. et al.

original article,Light concentration using hetero-junctions of anisotropic low permittivity metamaterials,"<p>Focusing incident power into an area of high concentration is of significant interest for various applications. In optics, this has been traditionally achieved with lenses where a higher curvature and lens permittivity typically result in shorter focal distances (low f/D). In this work, we present designs and techniques for collecting, refracting and guiding incident light into an area of high power concentration (a hot spot) at extremely short distances. Specifically, a flat low-profile focusing mechanism is presented using a hetero-junction of anisotropic metamaterials (MTMs). The hetero-junction is formed from two cleaved finite slabs of low (near zero) permittivity anisotropic MTMs with rotated optical axes. The MTMs have near zero longitudinal permittivity while matched in the transverse direction. Such MTMs are shown to provide a unique ability to bend the transverse magnetic or p-polarized light away from the normal and along the interface, contrary to conventional dielectrics, and with minimal reflections; hence allowing for a low profile design. Realizations in the optical regime are presented using periodic bilayers of metal and dielectric. The proposed hetero-junction focusing device concentrates the normally incident plane wave and/or beam into a corresponding focal region similar to a lens via multiple refractions. The hetero-junction is capable of creating a hot spot very close to the device, much closer than dielectric lenses and it significantly outperforms the size requirements of thick high curvature lenses with low f/D ratios. The proposed designs can find applications in various scenarios including solar and thermo photovoltaics, photodetectors, concentrated photovoltaics, non-imaging optics, micro- and nano-Fresnel lenses.</p>",[],True,"[""Mohammad Memarian"", ""George V Eleftheriades""]","Memarian, M., Eleftheriades, G.
