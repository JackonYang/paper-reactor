original article,High-aspect 3D two-photon polymerization structuring with widened objective working range (WOW-2PP),"<p>We developed a novel two-photon polymerization (2PP) configuration for fabrication of high-aspect three-dimensional (3D) structures, with an overall height larger than working distance of the microscope objective used for laser beam focusing into a photosensitive material. This method is based on a modified optical 2PP setup, where a microscope objective (100&#215; high N.A.), immersion oil and cover glass can be moved together into the photosensitive material, resulting in an effective higher and wider objective working range (WOW-2PP). The proposed technique enables the fabrication of high-aspect structures with sub-micrometer process resolution. 3D structures with a height of 7&#160;mm are demonstrated, which could hardly be built with the conventional 2PP set-up due to refractive index mismatch and laser beam disturbances.</p>",[],True,"[""Kotaro Obata"", ""Ayman El-Tamer"", ""Lothar Koch"", ""Ulf Hinze"", ""Boris N Chichkov""]","Obata, K., El-Tamer, A., Koch, L. et al.

original article,Direct imaging of the near field and dynamics of surface plasmon resonance on gold nanostructures using photoemission electron microscopy,"<p>Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can be supported by metallic nanoparticles and engineered nanostructures. An understanding of the spatially resolved near-field properties and dynamics of LSPR is important, but remains experimentally challenging. We report experimental studies toward this aim using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) with high spatial resolution of sub-10&#160;nm. Various engineered gold nanostructure arrays (such as rods, nanodisk-like particles and dimers) are investigated via PEEM using near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser pulses as the excitation source. When the LSPR wavelengths overlap the spectrum of the femtosecond pulses, the LSPR is efficiently excited and promotes multiphoton photoemission, which is correlated with the local intensity of the metallic nanoparticles in the near field. Thus, the local field distribution of the LSPR on different Au nanostructures can be directly explored and discussed using the PEEM images. In addition, the dynamics of the LSPR is studied by combining interferometric time-resolved pump-probe technique and PEEM. Detailed information on the oscillation and dephasing of the LSPR field can be obtained. The results identify PEEM as a powerful tool for accessing the near-field mapping and dynamic properties of plasmonic nanostructures.</p>",[],True,"[""Quan Sun"", ""Kosei Ueno"", ""Han Yu"", ""Atsushi Kubo"", ""Yasutaka Matsuo"", ""Hiroaki Misawa""]","Sun, Q., Ueno, K., Yu, H. et al.
