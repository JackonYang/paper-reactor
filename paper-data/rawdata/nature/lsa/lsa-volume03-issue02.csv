original article,"Healthy, natural, efficient and tunable lighting: four-package white LEDs for optimizing the circadian effect, color quality and vision performance","<p>To date, most current reports on the development and optimization of artificial lighting sources have focused on the energy performance levels and limited color qualities of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, these properties are insufficient in terms of representing all performance levels required when adjusting white LEDs for healthy and smart lighting. Here, we introduce essential and advanced figures of merit pertaining to circadian performance as well as vision performance and color quality. We compare all possible properties of commercialized artificial lighting, daylight and four-package white LEDs which consist of long-wavelength pass dichroic filter (LPDF)-capped, phosphor-converted red, amber and green LEDs (pc-LEDs) and a blue LED. We show that these tunable four-package white LEDs produce a tunable circadian effect for melatonin suppression/secretion, a high color quality for color perception/reproduction, high efficiency for energy savings and tunable figures of merit for the smart LED lighting market.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Kookmin University, Seoul 136-702, Korea', 'authors': ['Ji Hye Oh', ',\xa0Su Ji Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Young Rag Do']}]",True,"['Ji Hye Oh', 'Su Ji Yang', 'Young Rag Do']","Hye Oh, J., Ji Yang, S. & Rag Do, Y.

original article,Wafer-scale fabricated thermo-pneumatically tunable microlenses,"<p>We have developed a self-contained, liquid tunable microlens based on polyacrylate membranes integrated with compact on-chip thermo-pneumatic actuation fabricated using full-wafer processing. Silicone oil is used as the optical liquid, which is pushed or pulled into the lens cavity via an extended microfluidic channel structure without any pumps, valves or other mechanical means. The heat load generated by the thermal actuator is physically isolated from the lens chamber. The back focal length may be tuned from infinity to 4&#160;mm with a maximum power consumption of 300&#160;mW. The principal application is fine tuning of the back focal length, for which tuning time constants as small as 100&#160;ms are suitable.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Microsystems Engineering, University of Freiburg, 79110 Freiburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Wei Zhang', ',\xa0Hans Zappe', '\xa0&\xa0Andreas Seifert']}]",True,"['Wei Zhang', 'Hans Zappe', 'Andreas Seifert']","Zhang, W., Zappe, H. & Seifert, A.

original article,An optical fiber network oracle for NP-complete problems,"<p>The modern information society is enabled by photonic fiber networks characterized by huge coverage and great complexity and ranging in size from transcontinental submarine telecommunication cables to fiber to the home and local segments. This world-wide network has yet to match the complexity of the human brain, which contains a hundred billion neurons, each with thousands of synaptic connections on average. However, it already exceeds the complexity of brains from primitive organisms, i.e., the honey bee, which has a brain containing approximately one million neurons. In this study, we present a discussion of the computing potential of optical networks as information carriers. Using a simple fiber network, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that this network can be treated as an optical oracle for the Hamiltonian path problem, the famous mathematical complexity problem of finding whether a set of towns can be travelled via a path in which each town is visited only once. Pronouncement of a Hamiltonian path is achieved by monitoring the delay of an optical pulse that interrogates the network, and this delay will be equal to the sum of the travel times needed to visit all of the nodes (towns). We argue that the optical oracle could solve this NP-complete problem hundreds of times faster than brute-force computing. Additionally, we discuss secure communication applications for the optical oracle and propose possible implementation in silicon photonics and plasmonic networks.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637371, Singapore', 'authors': ['Kan Wu', ',\xa0Cesare Soci', ',\xa0Perry Ping Shum', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK', 'authors': ['Javier García de Abajo', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'IQFR-CSIC, 28006 Madrid, Spain', 'authors': ['Javier García de Abajo']}]",True,"['Kan Wu', 'Javier García de Abajo', 'Cesare Soci', 'Perry Ping Shum', 'Nikolay I Zheludev']","Wu, K., García de Abajo, J., Soci, C. et al.

original article,Subcycle control of terahertz waveform polarization using all-optically induced transient metamaterials,"<p>Coherent radiation with frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 30&#160;THz has recently become accessible using femtosecond laser technology. These terahertz (THz) waves have already been applied in spectroscopy and imaging and can be manipulated using static optical elements such as lenses, polarizers and filters. However, ultrafast modulation of THz radiation is required as well, for instance, in short-range wireless communication or for preparing shaped THz transients for the coherent control of numerous material excitations. Here, we demonstrate an all-optically created transient metamaterial that allows us to manipulate the polarization of THz waveforms with subcycle switch-on times. The polarization-modulated pulses are potentially interesting for controlling elementary motions such as the vibration of crystal lattices, the rotation of molecules and the precession of spins.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, 14195 Berlin, Germany', 'authors': ['N Kamaraju', ',\xa0Andrea Rubano', ',\xa0Jan Nötzold', ',\xa0R Kramer Campen', ',\xa0Martin Wolf', '\xa0&\xa0Tobias Kampfrath']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180, USA', 'authors': ['N Kamaraju']}, {'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica, CNR-SPIN, Università di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy', 'authors': ['Andrea Rubano']}, {'address': 'NUSNNI-Nanocore, National University of Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Linke Jian', ',\xa0Surajit Saha', '\xa0&\xa0T Venkatesan']}]",True,"['N Kamaraju', 'Andrea Rubano', 'Linke Jian', 'Surajit Saha', 'T Venkatesan', 'Jan Nötzold', 'R Kramer Campen', 'Martin Wolf', 'Tobias Kampfrath']","Kamaraju, N., Rubano, A., Jian, L. et al.
