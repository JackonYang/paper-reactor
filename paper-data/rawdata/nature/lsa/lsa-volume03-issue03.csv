original article,Doubling the field of view in off-axis low-coherence interferometric imaging,"<p>We present a new interferometric and holographic approach, named interferometry with doubled imaging area (IDIA), with which it is possible to double the camera field of view while performing off-axis interferometric imaging, without changing the imaging parameters, such as the magnification and the resolution. This technique enables quantitative amplitude and phase imaging of wider samples without reducing the acquisition frame rate due to scanning. The method is implemented using a compact interferometric module that connects to a regular digital camera, and is useful in a wide range of applications in which neither the field of view nor the acquisition rate can be compromised. Specifically, the IDIA principle allows doubling the off-axis interferometric field of view, which might be narrower than the camera field of view due to low-coherence illumination. We demonstrate the proposed technique for scan-free quantitative optical thickness imaging of microscopic biological samples, including live neurons and a human sperm cell in rapid motion under high magnification. In addition, we used the IDIA principle to perform non-destructive profilometry during a rapid lithography process of transparent structures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel', 'authors': ['Pinhas Girshovitz', '\xa0&\xa0Natan T Shaked']}]",True,"['Pinhas Girshovitz', 'Natan T Shaked']","Girshovitz, P., Shaked, N.

original article,Quantum digital spiral imaging,"<p>We demonstrate that the combination of digital spiral imaging with high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement can be used for efficiently probing and identifying pure phase objects, where the probing light does not necessarily touch the object, via the experimental, non-local decomposition of non-integer pure phase vortices in OAM-entangled photon pairs. The entangled photons are generated by parametric downconversion and then measured with spatial light modulators and single-mode fibers. The fractional phase vortices are defined in the idler photons, while their corresponding spiral spectra are obtained non-locally by scanning the measured OAM states in the signal photons. We conceptually illustrate our results with the biphoton Klyshko picture and the effective dimensionality to demonstrate the high-dimensional nature of the associated quantum OAM channels. Our result is a proof of concept that quantum imaging techniques exploiting high-dimensional entanglement can potentially be used for remote sensing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Laboratory of Nanoscale Condensed Matter Physics, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China', 'authors': ['Lixiang Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Jijin Lei']}, {'address': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK', 'authors': ['Jacquiline Romero']}]",True,"['Lixiang Chen', 'Jijin Lei', 'Jacquiline Romero']","Chen, L., Lei, J. & Romero, J.

original article,Quantized structuring of transparent films with femtosecond laser interference,"<p>The confinement of laser interactions inside transparent materials assisted by tight optical focusing and short-pulsed nonlinear interactions has driven many high-resolution patterning and probing applications in science and technology. In thin transparent films, laser interactions confined to the film/substrate interface have underpinned blistering and ejection processes for nanofluidic channel fabrication, film patterning and cell catapulting. Here, we harness femtosecond lasers to drive nonlinear interactions within Fabry&#8211;Perot interference fringes to define narrow nanolength scale zones for highly resolved internal structuring of a film of refractive index, n<sub>film</sub>, at fringe maxima separated by &#955;/2n<sub>film</sub>. This novel interaction internally cleaves the film to open subwavelength internal cavities and form thin membranes at single or multiple depths from which follow significant opportunities for writing multilevel nanofluidic channels inside the film, as well as ejecting nanodisks at quantized film depths for coloring and three-dimensional surface patterning that promise new compact types of lab-in-film devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', 'authors': ['Kitty Kumar', ',\xa0Jun Nogami', '\xa0&\xa0Nazir P Kherani']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada', 'authors': ['Kenneth KC Lee', ',\xa0Jianzhao Li', ',\xa0Nazir P Kherani', '\xa0&\xa0Peter R Herman']}]",True,"['Kitty Kumar', 'Kenneth KC Lee', 'Jianzhao Li', 'Jun Nogami', 'Nazir P Kherani', 'Peter R Herman']","Kumar, K., Lee, K., Li, J. et al.

original article,Lensless diffractive imaging with ultra-broadband table-top sources: from infrared to extreme-ultraviolet wavelengths,"<p>Lensless imaging is an approach to microscopy in which a high-resolution image of an object is reconstructed from one or more measured diffraction patterns, providing a solution in situations where the use of imaging optics is not possible. However, current lensless imaging methods are typically limited by the need for a light source with a narrow, stable and accurately known spectrum. We have developed a general approach to lensless imaging without spectral bandwidth limitations or sample requirements. We use two time-delayed coherent light pulses and show that scanning the pulse-to-pulse time delay allows the reconstruction of diffraction-limited images for all the spectral components in the pulse. In addition, we introduce an iterative phase retrieval algorithm that uses these spectrally resolved Fresnel diffraction patterns to obtain high-resolution images of complex extended objects. We demonstrate this two-pulse imaging method with octave-spanning visible light sources, in both transmission and reflection geometries, and with broadband extreme-ultraviolet radiation from a high-harmonic generation source. Our approach enables effective use of low-flux ultra-broadband sources, such as table-top high-harmonic generation systems, for high-resolution imaging.</p>",,"[{'address': 'LaserLaB Amsterdam, VU University Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Stefan Witte', ',\xa0Vasco T Tenner', ',\xa0Daniel WE Noom', '\xa0&\xa0Kjeld SE Eikema']}]",True,"['Stefan Witte', 'Vasco T Tenner', 'Daniel WE Noom', 'Kjeld SE Eikema']","Witte, S., Tenner, V., Noom, D. et al.
