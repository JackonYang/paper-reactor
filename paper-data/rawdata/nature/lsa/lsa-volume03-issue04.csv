review,Ultrafast lasers—reliable tools for advanced materials processing,"<p>The unique characteristics of ultrafast lasers, such as picosecond and femtosecond lasers, have opened up new avenues in materials processing that employ ultrashort pulse widths and extremely high peak intensities. Thus, ultrafast lasers are currently used widely for both fundamental research and practical applications. This review describes the characteristics of ultrafast laser processing and the recent advancements and applications of both surface and volume processing. Surface processing includes micromachining, micro- and nanostructuring, and nanoablation, while volume processing includes two-photon polymerization and three-dimensional (3D) processing within transparent materials. Commercial and industrial applications of ultrafast laser processing are also introduced, and a summary of the technology with future outlooks are also given.</p>",[],True,"[""Koji Sugioka"", ""Ya Cheng""]","Sugioka, K., Cheng, Y.

review,Metallic nanostructures for light trapping in energy-harvesting devices,"<p>Solar energy is abundant and environmentally friendly. Light trapping in solar-energy-harvesting devices or structures is of critical importance. This article reviews light trapping with metallic nanostructures for thin film solar cells and selective solar absorbers. The metallic nanostructures can either be used in reducing material thickness and device cost or in improving light absorbance and thereby improving conversion efficiency. The metallic nanostructures can contribute to light trapping by scattering and increasing the path length of light, by generating strong electromagnetic field in the active layer, or by multiple reflections/absorptions. We have also discussed the adverse effect of metallic nanostructures and how to solve these problems and take full advantage of the light-trapping effect.</p>",[],True,"[""Chuan Fei Guo"", ""Tianyi Sun"", ""Feng Cao"", ""Qian Liu"", ""Zhifeng Ren""]","Fei Guo, C., Sun, T., Cao, F. et al.

review,Adaptive optical microscopy: the ongoing quest for a perfect image,"<p>Adaptive optics is becoming a valuable tool for high resolution microscopy, providing correction for aberrations introduced by the refractive index structure of specimens. This is proving particularly promising for applications that require images from deep within biological tissue specimens. We review recent developments in adaptive microscopy, including methods and applications. A range of advances in different microscope modalities is covered and prospects for the future are discussed.</p>",[],True,"[""Martin J Booth""]","Booth, M.

original article,The effect of self-focusing on laser space-debris cleaning,"<p>A ground-based laser system for space-debris cleaning will use powerful laser pulses that can self-focus while propagating through the atmosphere. We demonstrate that for the relevant laser parameters, this self-focusing can noticeably decrease the laser intensity on the target. We show that the detrimental effect can be, to a great extent, compensated for by applying the optimal initial beam defocusing. The effect of laser elevation on the system performance is discussed.</p>",[],True,"[""Alexander M Rubenchik"", ""Michail P Fedoruk"", ""Sergei K Turitsyn""]","Rubenchik, A., Fedoruk, M. & Turitsyn, S.
