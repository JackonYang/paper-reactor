original article,Generating optical orbital angular momentum at visible wavelengths using a plasmonic metasurface,"<p>Light beams with a helical phase-front possess orbital angular momentum along their direction of propagation in addition to the spin angular momentum that describes their polarisation. Until recently, it was thought that these two &#8216;rotational&#8217; motions of light were largely independent and could not be coupled during light&#8211;matter interactions. However, it is now known that interactions with carefully designed complex media can result in spin-to-orbit coupling, where a change of the spin angular momentum will modify the orbital angular momentum and vice versa. In this work, we propose and demonstrate that the birefringence of plasmonic nanostructures can be wielded to transform circularly polarised light into light carrying orbital angular momentum. A device operating at visible wavelengths is designed from a space-variant array of subwavelength plasmonic nano-antennas. Experiment confirms that circularly polarised light transmitted through the device is imbued with orbital angular momentum of &#177;2&#295; (with conversion efficiency of at least 1%). This technology paves the way towards ultrathin orbital angular momentum generators that could be integrated into applications for spectroscopy, nanoscale sensing and classical or quantum communications using integrated photonic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ont.

original article,Enhancing precision in fs-laser material processing by simultaneous spatial and temporal focusing,"<p>In recent years, femtosecond (fs)-lasers have evolved into a versatile tool for high precision micromachining of transparent materials because nonlinear absorption in the focus can result in refractive index modifications or material disruptions. However, when high pulse energies or low numerical apertures are required, nonlinear side effects such as self-focusing, filamentation or white light generation can decrease the modification quality. In this paper, we apply simultaneous spatial and temporal focusing (SSTF) to overcome these limitations. The main advantage of SSTF is that the ultrashort pulse is only formed at the focal plane, thereby confining the intensity distribution strongly to the focal volume and suppressing detrimental nonlinear side effects. Thus, we investigate the optical breakdown within a water cell by pump-probe shadowgraphy, comparing conventional focusing and SSTF under equivalent focusing conditions. The plasma formation is well confined for low pulse energies &lt;2&#8197;&#181;J, but higher pulse energies lead to the filamentation and break-up of the disruptions for conventional focusing, thereby decreasing the modification quality. In contrast, plasma induced by SSTF stays well confined to the focal plane, even for high pulse energies up to 8&#8197;&#181;J, preventing extended filaments, side branches or break-up of the disruptions. Furthermore, while conventional focusing leads to broadband supercontinuum generation, only marginal spectral broadening is observed using SSTF. These experimental findings are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the nonlinear pulse propagation and interaction processes. Therefore, SSTF appears to be a powerful tool to control the processing of transparent materials, e.g., for precise ophthalmic fs-surgery.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Applied Physics, Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany', 'authors': ['Robert Kammel', ',\xa0Roland Ackermann', ',\xa0Jens Thomas', ',\xa0Andreas Tünnermann', '\xa0&\xa0Stefan Nolte']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO 80401, USA', 'authors': ['Jens Thomas']}, {'address': 'Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, 01187 Dresden, Germany', 'authors': ['Jörg Götte', '\xa0&\xa0Stefan Skupin']}, {'address': 'Institute of Condensed Matter Theory and Solid State Optics, Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany', 'authors': ['Stefan Skupin']}, {'address': 'Université de Bordeaux – CNRS – CEA, Centre Lasers Intenses et Applications, UMR 5107, 33405 Talence, France', 'authors': ['Stefan Skupin']}, {'address': 'Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, 07745 Jena, Germany', 'authors': ['Andreas Tünnermann', '\xa0&\xa0Stefan Nolte']}]",True,"['Robert Kammel', 'Roland Ackermann', 'Jens Thomas', 'Jörg Götte', 'Stefan Skupin', 'Andreas Tünnermann', 'Stefan Nolte']","Kammel, R., Ackermann, R., Thomas, J. et al.

original article,Tunable multiband terahertz metamaterials using a reconfigurable electric split-ring resonator array,"<p>We demonstrate micromachined reconfigurable metamaterials working at multiple frequencies simultaneously in the terahertz range. The proposed metamaterial structures can be structurally reconfigured by employing flexible microelectromechanical system-based cantilevers in the resonators, which are designed to deform out of plane under an external stimulus. The proposed metamaterial structures provide not only multiband resonance frequency operation but also polarization-dependent tunability. Three kinds of metamaterials are investigated as electric split-ring resonator (eSRR) arrays with different positions of the split. By moving the position of the split away from the resonator's center, the eSRR exhibits anisotropy, with the dipole resonance splitting into two resonances. The dipole&#8211;dipole coupling strength can be continuously adjusted, which enables the electromagnetic response to be tailored by adjusting the direct current (DC) voltage between the released cantilevers and the silicon substrate. The observed tunability of the eSRRs is found to be dependent on the polarization of the incident terahertz wave. This polarization-dependent tunability is demonstrated by both experimental measurements and electromagnetic simulations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117576, Singapore', 'authors': ['Fusheng Ma', ',\xa0Yu-Sheng Lin', '\xa0&\xa0Chengkuo Lee']}, {'address': 'Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR, Singapore 117602, Singapore', 'authors': ['Xinhai Zhang']}]",True,"['Fusheng Ma', 'Yu-Sheng Lin', 'Xinhai Zhang', 'Chengkuo Lee']","Ma, F., Lin, Y., Zhang, X. et al.

original article,100 GHz silicon–organic hybrid modulator,"<p>Electro-optic modulation at frequencies of 100&#8197;GHz and beyond is important for photonic-electronic signal processing at the highest speeds. To date, however, only a small number of devices exist that can operate up to this frequency. In this study, we demonstrate that this frequency range can be addressed by nanophotonic, silicon-based modulators. We exploit the ultrafast Pockels effect by using the silicon&#8211;organic hybrid (SOH) platform, which combines highly nonlinear organic molecules with silicon waveguides. Until now, the bandwidth of these devices was limited by the losses of the radiofrequency (RF) signal and the RC (resistor-capacitor) time constant of the silicon structure. The RF losses are overcome by using a device as short as 500&#8197;&#181;m, and the RC time constant is decreased by using a highly conductive electron accumulation layer and an improved gate insulator. Using this method, we demonstrate for the first time an integrated silicon modulator with a 3dB bandwidth at an operating frequency beyond 100&#8197;GHz. Our results clearly indicate that the RC time constant is not a fundamental speed limitation of SOH devices at these frequencies. Our device has a voltage&#8211;length product of only V<sub>&#960;</sub>L=11&#8197;V mm, which compares favorably with the best silicon-photonic modulators available today. Using cladding materials with stronger nonlinearities, the voltage&#8211;length product is expected to improve by more than an order of magnitude.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institutes IPQ and IMT, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany', 'authors': ['Luca Alloatti', ',\xa0Robert Palmer', ',\xa0Wolfgang Freude', ',\xa0Christian Koos', '\xa0&\xa0Juerg Leuthold']}, {'address': 'Institute IHE, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany', 'authors': ['Sebastian Diebold', ',\xa0Kai Philipp Pahl', '\xa0&\xa0Thomas Zwick']}, {'address': 'GigOptix Inc., Bothell, WA, USA', 'authors': ['Baoquan Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Raluca Dinu']}, {'address': 'CEA, Leti, 38054 Grenoble, France', 'authors': ['Maryse Fournier', '\xa0&\xa0Jean-Marc Fedeli']}, {'address': 'Institute of Photonic Systems, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Juerg Leuthold']}]",True,"['Luca Alloatti', 'Robert Palmer', 'Sebastian Diebold', 'Kai Philipp Pahl', 'Baoquan Chen', 'Raluca Dinu', 'Maryse Fournier', 'Jean-Marc Fedeli', 'Thomas Zwick', 'Wolfgang Freude', 'Christian Koos', 'Juerg Leuthold']","Alloatti, L., Palmer, R., Diebold, S. et al. 100 GHz silicon–organic hybrid modulator.
