original article,Hybrid 2D–3D optical devices for integrated optics by direct laser writing,"<p>Integrated optical chips have already been established for application in optical communication. They also offer interesting future perspectives for integrated quantum optics on a chip. At present, however, they are mostly fabricated using essentially planar fabrication approaches like electron-beam lithography or UV optical lithography. Many further design options would arise if one had complete fabrication freedom in regard to the third dimension normal to the chip without having to give up the virtues and the know-how of existing planar fabrication technologies. As a step in this direction, we here use three-dimensional dip-in direct-laser-writing optical lithography to fabricate three-dimensional polymeric functional devices on pre-fabricated planar optical chips containing Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> waveguides as well as grating couplers made by standard electron-beam lithography. The first example is a polymeric dielectric rectangular-shaped waveguide which is connected to Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> waveguides and that is adiabatically twisted along its axis to achieve geometrical rotation of linear polarization on the chip. The rotator&#8217;s broadband performance at around 1550&#8197;nm wavelength is verified by polarization-dependent grating couplers. Such polarization rotation on the optical chip cannot easily be achieved by other means. The second example is a whispering-gallery-mode optical resonator connected to Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> waveguides on the chip via polymeric waveguides. By mechanically connecting the latter to the disk, we can control the coupling to the resonator and, at the same time, guarantee mechanical stability of the three-dimensional architecture on the chip.</p>",[],True,"[""Martin Schumann"", ""Tiemo B\u00fcckmann"", ""Nico Gruhler"", ""Martin Wegener"", ""Wolfram Pernice""]","Schumann, M., Bückmann, T., Gruhler, N. et al.

original article,An electrophosphorescent organic light emitting concentrator,"<p>We demonstrate threefold directional light concentration from an organic light-emitting diode luminaire for use in spot lighting and other applications where high intensity illumination is required. The concentrating luminaire comprises four triangular, large-area green electrophosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) deposited on plastic substrates and assembled into a pyramidal structure with an open base that serves as the light exit aperture. The PHOLED surfaces are highly reflective to direct the emission from the devices to the aperture independent of the original emission position within the pyramid. The far-field intensity profile of the concentrator has a &#8216;batwing&#8217; distribution that meets the requirements for general lighting for uniform illumination of planar surfaces.</p>",[],True,"[""Jaesang Lee"", ""Michael Slootsky"", ""Kyusang Lee"", ""Yifan Zhang"", ""Stephen R Forrest""]","Lee, J., Slootsky, M., Lee, K. et al.

original article,Experimental control of optical helicity in nanophotonics,"<p>An analysis of light&#8211;matter interactions based on symmetries can provide valuable insight, particularly because it reveals which quantities are conserved and which ones can be transformed within a physical system. In this context, helicity can be a useful addition to more commonly considered observables such as angular momentum. The question arises how to treat helicity, the projection of the total angular momentum onto the linear momentum direction, in practical experiments. In this paper, we put forward a simple but versatile experimental treatment of helicity. We then apply the proposed method to the scattering of light by isolated cylindrical nanoapertures in a gold film. This allows us to study the helicity transformation taking place during the interaction of focused light with the nanoapertures. In particular, we observe from the transmitted light that the scaling of the helicity transformed component with the aperture size is very different to the direct helicity component.</p>",[],True,"[""Nora Tischler"", ""Ivan Fernandez-Corbaton"", ""Xavier Zambrana-Puyalto"", ""Alexander Minovich"", ""Xavier Vidal"", ""Mathieu L Juan"", ""Gabriel Molina-Terriza""]","Tischler, N., Fernandez-Corbaton, I., Zambrana-Puyalto, X. et al.

review,Light scattering and surface plasmons on small spherical particles,"<p>Light scattering by small particles has a long and interesting history in physics. Nonetheless, it continues to surprise with new insights and applications. This includes new discoveries, such as novel plasmonic effects, as well as exciting theoretical and experimental developments such as optical trapping, anomalous light scattering, optical tweezers, nanospasers, and novel aspects and realizations of Fano resonances. These have led to important new applications, including several ones in the biomedical area and in sensing techniques at the single-molecule level. There are additionally many potential future applications in optical devices and solar energy technologies.
