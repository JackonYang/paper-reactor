original article,Design and fabrication of broadband ultralow reflectivity black Si surfaces by laser micro/nanoprocessing,"<p>Light collection efficiency is an important factor that affects the performance of many optical and optoelectronic devices. In these devices, the high reflectivity of interfaces can hinder efficient light collection. To minimize unwanted reflection, anti-reflection surfaces can be fabricated by micro/nanopatterning. In this paper, we investigate the fabrication of broadband anti-reflection Si surfaces by laser micro/nanoprocessing. Laser direct writing is applied to create microstructures on Si surfaces that reduce light reflection by light trapping. In addition, laser interference lithography and metal assisted chemical etching are adopted to fabricate the Si nanowire arrays. The anti-reflection performance is greatly improved by the high aspect ratio subwavelength structures, which create gradients of refractive index from the ambient air to the substrate. Furthermore, by decoration of the Si nanowires with metallic nanoparticles, surface plasmon resonance can be used to further control the broadband reflections, reducing the reflection to below 1.0% across from 300 to 1200&#8197;nm. An average reflection of 0.8% is achieved.</p>",[],True,"[""Jing Yang"", ""Fangfang Luo"", ""Tsung Sheng Kao"", ""Xiong Li"", ""Ghim Wei Ho"", ""Jinghua Teng"", ""Xiangang Luo"", ""Minghui Hong""]","Yang, J., Luo, F., Kao, T. et al.

original article,Ultrastable embedded surface plasmon confocal interferometry,"<p>As disease diagnosis becomes more sophisticated, there is a requirement to measure small numbers of molecules attached to, for instance, an antibody. This requires a sensor capable not only of high sensitivity but also the ability to make measurements over a highly localized region. In previous publications, we have shown how a modified confocal microscope allows one to make localized surface plasmon (SP) measurements on a scale far smaller than the surface plasmon propagation distance. The present implementation presents a new ultrastable interferometer system, which greatly improves the noise performance. Hitherto, we have used the central part of the back focal plane to form a reference beam with the reradiated surface plasmons. In the current system, we block the central part and use the spatial light modulator to deflect s-polarized light into the pinhole to form an interference signal with the surface plasmons, thus creating an ultrastable interferometer formed with two beams incident at very similar angles. We demonstrate the superior noise performance of the system in hostile environments and examine further adaptations of the system to further enhance noise performance.</p>",[],True,"[""Suejit Pechprasarn"", ""Bei Zhang"", ""Darren Albutt"", ""Jing Zhang"", ""Michael Somekh""]","Pechprasarn, S., Zhang, B., Albutt, D. et al.

original article,Simultaneous broadband generation of second and third harmonics from chirped nonlinear photonic crystals,"<p>Ultrabroadband laser sources are highly desirable in a wide variety of modern science disciplines ranging from physics, chemistry and materials science to information communications and processing. Here we present the design and fabrication of a chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPPLN) nonlinear photonic crystal that supports multiple orders of quasiphase matching with finite bandwidth and allows for the simultaneous broadband generation of second and third harmonics with high conversion efficiency. Moreover, the chirp rate has a significant influence on the conversion efficiency and bandwidth. The CPPLN scheme offers a promising approach for the construction of short-wavelength laser sources and enables the generation of the three primary colors&#8212;red, green and blue&#8212;from a single crystal, which may have potential applications in large-screen laser displays.</p>",[],True,"[""Bao-Qin Chen"", ""Ming-Liang Ren"", ""Rong-Juan Liu"", ""Chao Zhang"", ""Yan Sheng"", ""Bo-Qin Ma"", ""Zhi-Yuan Li""]","Chen, BQ., Ren, ML., Liu, RJ. et al.

original article,Proposed graphene nanospaser,"<p>We propose a novel nanospaser that operates in the mid-infrared region and utilizes a nanopatch of graphene as its plasmonic core and a quantum-well cascade as its gain medium. This design takes advantage of the low optical losses in graphene resulting from its high electron mobility. The proposed quantum cascade graphene spaser generates optical fields with unprecedentedly high nanolocalization, which is characteristic of graphene plasmons. This spaser will be an efficient nanosource of intense and coherent hot-spot fields in the mid-infrared spectral region with potential widespread applications in mid-infrared nanoscopy, nanospectroscopy, nanolithography, and optoelectronic information processing.</p>",[],True,"[""Vadym Apalkov"", ""Mark I Stockman""]","Apalkov, V., Stockman, M.
