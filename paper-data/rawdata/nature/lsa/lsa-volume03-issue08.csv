original article,Multi-ion cooperative processes in Yb3+ clusters,"<p>Cooperative luminescence (CL) occurs in spectral regions in which single ions do not have energy levels. It was first observed more than 40 years ago, and all results reported so far are from a pair of ions. In this work, upconverted CL of three Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions was observed in the ultraviolet (UV) region under near-infrared (NIR) excitation. The UV CL intensity showed a cubic dependence on the NIR pump power, whereas the luminescence lifetime was nearly one-third the luminescence lifetime of single Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions. The triplet CL (TCL) has a clear spectral structure, in which most emission peaks are consistent with the self-convoluted spectra from single Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions. Blue shifts were observed for certain peaks, indicating complex interactions among the excited Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions. The probability of the TCL process versus the average distances among three Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions was derived via the first- and second-order corrections to the wave functions of lanthanide ions, indicating that the formation of Yb<sup>3+</sup> clusters containing closely spaced ions favors the occurrence of the multi-ion interaction processes. Furthermore, the cooperative sensitization of one Gd<sup>3+</sup> ion by four excited Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions (Yb<sup>3+</sup>-tetramer) was demonstrated experimentally, which exhibited a novel upconversion mechanism&#8212;cluster sensitization. Our results are intriguing for further exploring quantum transitions that simultaneously involve multiple ions.</p>",[],True,"[""Wei-Ping Qin"", ""Zhen-Yu Liu"", ""Chol-Nam Sin"", ""Chang-Feng Wu"", ""Guan-Shi Qin"", ""Zhe Chen"", ""Ke-Zhi Zheng""]","Qin, WP., Liu, ZY., Sin, CN. et al.

original article,Coupling model for an extended-range plasmonic optical transformer scanning probe,"<p>The expansion of nanoscale optics has generated a variety of scanning probe geometries that yield spatial resolution below 10&#160;nm. In this work, we present a physical model for coupling far-field radiation to plasmonic modes on the surface of a scanning probe, and propose a scheme for extending the working distance of such a probe. In a subsurface application, an optical transformer at the tip of a probe can be coupled to a remote near-field antenna placed inside the sample at a distance away from the surface, expanding the effective working distance up to 100&#160;nm.</p>",[],True,"[""Aleksandr Polyakov"", ""Mauro Melli"", ""Giuseppe Cantarella"", ""Adam Schwartzberg"", ""Alexander Weber-Bargioni"", ""P James Schuck"", ""Stefano Cabrini""]","Polyakov, A., Melli, M., Cantarella, G. et al.

original article,Efficient unidirectional polarization-controlled excitation of surface plasmon polaritons,"<p>Efficient excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) remains one of the most challenging issues in areas of plasmonics related to information communication technologies. In particular, combining high SPP excitation efficiency and acceptance of any polarization of incident light appeared to be impossible to attain due to the polarized nature of SPPs. Here we demonstrate plasmonic couplers that represent arrays of gap SPP resonators producing upon reflection two orthogonal phase gradients in respective linear polarizations of incident radiation. These couplers are thereby capable of efficiently converting incident radiation with arbitrary polarization into SPPs that propagate in orthogonal directions dictated by the phase gradients. Fabricated couplers operate at telecom wavelengths and feature the coupling efficiency of &#8764;25% for either of two linear polarizations of incident radiation and directivity of SPP excitation exceeding 100. We further demonstrate that an individual wavelength-sized unit cell, representing a meta-scatterer, can also be used for efficient and polarization sensitive SPP excitation in compact plasmonics circuits.</p>",[],True,"[""Anders Pors"", ""Michael G Nielsen"", ""Thomas Bernardin"", ""Jean-Claude Weeber"", ""Sergey I Bozhevolnyi""]","Pors, A., Nielsen, M., Bernardin, T. et al.

review,Nanowire-supported plasmonic waveguide for remote excitation of surface-enhanced Raman scattering,"<p>Due to its amazing ability to manipulate light at the nanoscale, plasmonics has become one of the most interesting topics in the field of light&#8211;matter interaction. As a promising application of plasmonics, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been widely used in scientific investigations and material analysis. The large enhanced Raman signals are mainly caused by the extremely enhanced electromagnetic field that results from localized surface plasmon polaritons. Recently, a novel SERS technology called remote SERS has been reported, combining both localized surface plasmon polaritons and propagating surface plasmon polaritons (PSPPs, or called plasmonic waveguide), which may be found in prominent applications in special circumstances compared to traditional local SERS. In this article, we review the mechanism of remote SERS and its development since it was first reported in 2009. Various remote metal systems based on plasmonic waveguides, such as nanoparticle&#8211;nanowire systems, single nanowire systems, crossed nanowire systems and nanowire dimer systems, are introduced, and recent novel applications, such as sensors, plasmon-driven surface-catalyzed reactions and Raman optical activity, are also presented. Furthermore, studies of remote SERS in dielectric and organic systems based on dielectric waveguides remind us that this useful technology has additional, tremendous application prospects that have not been realized in metal systems.</p>",[],True,"[""Yingzhou Huang"", ""Yurui Fang"", ""Zhenglong Zhang"", ""Ling Zhu"", ""Mengtao Sun""]","Huang, Y., Fang, Y., Zhang, Z. et al.

review,Emission properties of nanolasers during the transition to lasing,"<p>This review addresses ongoing discussions involving nanolaser experiments, particularly those related to thresholdless lasing or few-emitter devices. A quantum-optical (quantum-mechanical active medium and radiation field) theory is used to examine the emission properties of nanolasers under different experimental configurations. The active medium is treated as inhomogeneously broadened semiconductor quantum dots embedded in a quantum well, where carriers are introduced via current injection. Comparisons are made between a conventional laser and a nanolaser with a spontaneous emission factor of unity, as well as a laser with only a few quantum dots providing the gain. It is found that the combined exploration of intensity, coherence time, photon autocorrelation function and carrier spectral hole burning can provide a unique and consistent picture of nanolasers in the new regimes of laser operation during the transition from thermal to coherent emission. Furthermore, by reducing the number of quantum dots in the optical cavity, a clear indication of non-classical photon statistics is observed before the single-quantum-dot limit is reached.</p>",[],True,"[""Weng W Chow"", ""Frank Jahnke"", ""Christopher Gies""]","Chow, W., Jahnke, F. & Gies, C.
