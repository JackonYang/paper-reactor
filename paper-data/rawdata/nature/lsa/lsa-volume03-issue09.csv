original article,Holographic planar lightwave circuit for on-chip spectroscopy,"<p>Computer-generated planar holograms are a powerful approach for designing planar lightwave circuits with unique properties. Digital planar holograms in particular can encode any optical transfer function with high customizability and is compatible with semiconductor lithography techniques and nanoimprint lithography. Here, we demonstrate that the integration of multiple holograms on a single device increases the overall spectral range of the spectrometer and offsets any performance decrement resulting from miniaturization. The validation of a high-resolution spectrometer-on-chip based on digital planar holograms shows performance comparable with that of a macrospectrometer. While maintaining the total device footprint below 2&#8197;cm<sup>2</sup>, the newly developed spectrometer achieved a spectral resolution of 0.15&#8197;nm in the red and near infrared range, over a 148&#8197;nm spectral range and 926 channels. This approach lays the groundwork for future on-chip spectroscopy and lab-on-chip sensing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'aBeam Technologies, Hayward, CA 94541, USA', 'authors': ['Giuseppe Calafiore', ',\xa0Sergey Babin', '\xa0&\xa0Christophe Peroz']}, {'address': 'Polytechnic University of Turin, 10129 Turin, Italy', 'authors': ['Giuseppe Calafiore']}, {'address': 'Nano-Optic Devices, Santa Clara, CA 95054, USA', 'authors': ['Alexander Koshelev', ',\xa0Alexander Goltsov', ',\xa0Pavel Sasorov', '\xa0&\xa0Vladimir Yankov']}, {'address': 'Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow 141700, Russia', 'authors': ['Alexander Koshelev']}, {'address': 'The Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA', 'authors': ['Scott Dhuey', '\xa0&\xa0Stefano Cabrini']}]",True,"['Giuseppe Calafiore', 'Alexander Koshelev', 'Scott Dhuey', 'Alexander Goltsov', 'Pavel Sasorov', 'Sergey Babin', 'Vladimir Yankov', 'Stefano Cabrini', 'Christophe Peroz']","Calafiore, G., Koshelev, A., Dhuey, S. et al.

original article,Optical orientation and shifting of a single multiwalled carbon nanotube,"<p>The orientation and shifting of individual carbon nanotubes are extremely important in the assembly of building blocks of nanodevices and in the development of one-dimensional materials for interdisciplinary applications. Here, we report an optical method that is capable of producing the controlled orientation and targeted shifting of single multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using an optical-fiber nanotip. In a demonstration of this technique, a single MWCNT with an outer diameter of 50&#8197;nm and a length of 0.9&#8197;&#181;m was first trapped by the nanotip using a laser beam with a wavelength of 980&#8197;nm and was then oriented and shifted along the nanotip axis as a result of the interaction of the MWCNT with the optical field output by the nanotip. Various optical powers were applied to characterize the orientation and shifting performance. The orientation and shifting of MWCNTs of various sizes were also demonstrated.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Physics and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China', 'authors': ['Hongbao Xin', '\xa0&\xa0Baojun Li']}]",True,"['Hongbao Xin', 'Baojun Li']","Xin, H., Li, B.

original article,An ultrafast reconfigurable nanophotonic switch using wavefront shaping of light in a nonlinear nanomaterial,"<p>We demonstrate a new concept for reconfigurable nanophotonic devices exploiting ultrafast nonlinear control of shaped wavefronts in a multimode nanomaterial consisting of semiconductor nanowires. Femtosecond pulsed laser excitation of the nanowire mat is shown to provide an efficient nonlinear mechanism to control both destructive and constructive interference in a shaped wavefront. Modulations of up to 63% are induced by optical pumping, due to a combination of multimode dephasing and induced transient absorption. We show that part of the nonlinear phase dynamics can be inverted to provide a dynamical revival of the wavefront into an optimized spot with up to 18% increase of the peak to background ratio caused by pulsed laser excitation. The concepts of multimode nonlinear switching demonstrated here are generally extendable to other photonic and plasmonic systems and enable new avenues for ultrafast and reconfigurable nanophotonic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics and Astronomy, Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK', 'authors': ['Tom Strudley', ',\xa0Roman Bruck', '\xa0&\xa0Otto L Muskens']}, {'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre, Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK', 'authors': ['Ben Mills']}]",True,"['Tom Strudley', 'Roman Bruck', 'Ben Mills', 'Otto L Muskens']","Strudley, T., Bruck, R., Mills, B. et al.
