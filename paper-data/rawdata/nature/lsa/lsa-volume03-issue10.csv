original article,320-fold luminescence enhancement of [Ru(dpp)3]Cl2 dispersed on PMMA opal photonic crystals and highly improved oxygen sensing performance,"<p>Ru complexes ([Ru(dpp)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>) were spin coated on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) opal photonic crystals (PhCs), and a &#8764;320-fold luminescence enhancement was observed compared to that on glass, which is the largest luminescence enhancement of dye molecules by the modulation of three-dimensional (3D) PhCs reported until now. The enhancement mechanism was carefully examined and it was shown that the luminescence of [Ru(dpp)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> depended on the molecule concentration and temperature. It can be concluded that the suppressed non-radiative relaxation among the molecules and the field enhancement both contribute significantly to the luminescence enhancement. The PMMA PhC/Ru complex composites were then tested for their intracellular oxygen sensing and cell imaging properties; these composites effectively improved the limit of detection (LOD) and the brightness of the cell images.</p>",[],True,"[""Pingwei Zhou"", ""Donglei Zhou"", ""Li Tao"", ""Yongsheng Zhu"", ""Wen Xu"", ""Sai Xu"", ""Shaobo Cui"", ""Lin Xu"", ""Hongwei Song""]","Zhou, P., Zhou, D., Tao, L. et al. 320-fold luminescence enhancement of [Ru(dpp)3]Cl2dispersed on PMMA opal photonic crystals and highly improved oxygen sensing performance.

original article,A concept for multiterawatt fibre lasers based on coherent pulse stacking in passive cavities,"<p>Since the advent of femtosecond lasers, performance improvements have constantly impacted on existing applications and enabled novel applications. However, one performance feature bearing the potential of a quantum leap for high-field applications is still not available: the simultaneous emission of extremely high peak and average powers. Emerging applications such as laser particle acceleration require exactly this performance regime and, therefore, challenge laser technology at large. On the one hand, canonical bulk systems can provide pulse peak powers in the multi-terawatt to petawatt range, while on the other hand, advanced solid-state-laser concepts such as the thin disk, slab or fibre are well known for their high efficiency and their ability to emit high average powers in the kilowatt range with excellent beam quality. In this contribution, a compact laser system capable of simultaneously providing high peak and average powers with high wall-plug efficiency is proposed and analysed. The concept is based on the temporal coherent combination (pulse stacking) of a pulse train emitted from a high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser system in a passive enhancement cavity. Thus, the pulse energy is increased at the cost of the repetition rate while almost preserving the average power. The concept relies on a fast switching element for dumping the enhanced pulse out of the cavity. The switch constitutes the key challenge of our proposal. Addressing this challenge could, for the first time, allow the highly efficient dumping of joule-class pulses at megawatt average power levels and lead to unprecedented laser parameters.</p>",[],True,"[""Sven Breitkopf"", ""Tino Eidam"", ""Arno Klenke"", ""Lorenz von Grafenstein"", ""Henning Carstens"", ""Simon Holzberger"", ""Ernst Fill"", ""Thomas Schreiber"", ""Ferenc Krausz"", ""Andreas T\u00fcnnermann"", ""Ioachim Pupeza"", ""Jens Limpert""]","Breitkopf, S., Eidam, T., Klenke, A. et al.A concept for multiterawatt fibre lasers based on coherent pulse stacking in passive cavities.

original article,Colored ultrathin hybrid photovoltaics with high quantum efficiency,"<p>Most current solar panels are fabricated via complex processes using expensive semiconductor materials, and they are rigid and heavy with a dull, black appearance. As a result of their non-aesthetic appearance and weight, they are primarily installed on rooftops to minimize their negative impact on building appearance. The large surfaces and interiors of modern buildings are not efficiently utilized for potential electric power generation. Here, we introduce dual-function solar cells based on ultrathin dopant-free amorphous silicon embedded in an optical cavity that not only efficiently extract the photogenerated carriers but also display distinctive colors with the desired angle-insensitive appearances. Light-energy-harvesting colored signage is demonstrated. Furthermore, a cascaded photovoltaics scheme based on tunable spectrum splitting can be employed to increase power efficiency by absorbing a broader band of light energy. This study pioneers a new approach to architecturally compatible and decorative thin-film photovoltaics.</p>",[],True,"[""Kyu-Tae Lee"", ""Jae Yong Lee"", ""Sungyong Seo"", ""L Jay Guo""]","Lee, KT., Lee, J., Seo, S. et al.

original article,"Coding metamaterials, digital metamaterials and programmable metamaterials","<p>Metamaterials are artificial structures that are usually described by effective medium parameters on the macroscopic scale, and these metamaterials are referred to as &#8216;analog metamaterials&#8217;. Here, we propose &#8216;digital metamaterials&#8217; through two steps. First, we present &#8216;coding metamaterials&#8217; that are composed of only two types of unit cells, with 0 and &#960; phase responses, which we name &#8216;0&#8217; and &#8216;1&#8217; elements, respectively. By coding &#8216;0&#8217; and &#8216;1&#8217; elements with controlled sequences (i.e., 1-bit coding), we can manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves and realize different functionalities. The concept of coding metamaterials can be extended from 1-bit coding to 2-bit coding or higher. In 2-bit coding, four types of unit cells, with phase responses of 0, &#960;/2, &#960;, and 3&#960;/2, are required to mimic the &#8216;00&#8217;, &#8216;01&#8217;, &#8216;10&#8217; and &#8216;11&#8217; elements, respectively. The 2-bit coding has greater freedom than 1-bit coding for controlling EM waves. Second, we propose a unique metamaterial particle that has either a &#8216;0&#8217; or &#8216;1&#8217; response controlled by a biased diode. Based on this particle, we present &#8216;digital metamaterials&#8217; with unit cells that possess either a &#8216;0&#8217; or &#8216;1&#8217; state. Using a field-programmable gate array, we realize digital control over the digital metamaterial. By programming different coding sequences, a single digital metamaterial has the ability to manipulate EM waves in different manners, thereby realizing &#8216;programmable metamaterials&#8217;. The above concepts and physical phenomena are confirmed through numerical simulations and experiments using metasurfaces.</p>",[],True,"[""Tie Jun Cui"", ""Mei Qing Qi"", ""Xiang Wan"", ""Jie Zhao"", ""Qiang Cheng""]","Cui, T., Qi, M., Wan, X. et al.

review,Fundamentals of phase-only liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) devices,"<p>This paper describes the fundamentals of phase-only liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) technology, which have not been previously discussed in detail. This technology is widely utilized in high efficiency applications for real-time holography and diffractive optics. The paper begins with a brief introduction on the developmental trajectory of phase-only LCOS technology, followed by the correct selection of liquid crystal (LC) materials and corresponding electro-optic effects in such devices. Attention is focused on the essential requirements of the physical aspects of the LC layer as well as the indispensable parameters for the response time of the device. Furthermore, the basic functionalities embedded in the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) silicon backplane for phase-only LCOS devices are illustrated, including two typical addressing schemes. Finally, the application of phase-only LCOS devices in real-time holography will be introduced in association with the use of cutting-edge computer-generated holograms.</p>",[],True,"[""Zichen Zhang"", ""Zheng You"", ""Daping Chu""]","Zhang, Z., You, Z. & Chu, D.
