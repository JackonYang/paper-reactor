original article,Refractometric biosensing based on optical phase flips in sparse and short-range-ordered nanoplasmonic layers,"<p>Noble metal nanoparticles support localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) that are extremely sensitive to the local dielectric properties of the environment within distances up to 10&#8211;100&#8197;nm from the metal surface. The significant overlap between the sensing volume of the nanoparticles and the size of biological macromolecules has made LSPR biosensing a key field for the application of plasmonics. Recent advancements in evaluating plasmonic refractometric sensors have suggested that the phase detection of light can surpass the sensitivity of standard intensity-based detection techniques. Here, we experimentally confirm that the phase of light can be used to precisely track local refractive index changes induced by biomolecular reactions, even for dilute and layers of short-range-ordered plasmonic nanoparticles. In particular, we demonstrate that the sensitivity can be enhanced by tuning in to a zero reflection condition, in which an abrupt phase flip of the reflected light is achieved. Using a cost-effective interference fringe tracking technique, we demonstrate that phase measurements yield an approximately one order of magnitude larger relative shift compared with traditional LSPR measurements for the model system of NeutrAvidin binding to biotinylated nanodisks.</p>",[],True,"[""Mikael Svedendahl"", ""Ruggero Verre"", ""Mikael K\u00e4ll""]","Svedendahl, M., Verre, R. & KÃ¤ll, M.

original article,Fluorescence and SEM correlative microscopy for nanomanipulation of subcellular structures,"<p>Nanomanipulation under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enables direct interactions of a tool with a sample. We recently developed a nanomanipulation technique for the extraction and identification of DNA contained within sub-nuclear locations of a single cell nucleus. In nanomanipulation of sub-cellular structures, a key step is to identify targets of interest through correlating fluorescence and SEM images. The DNA extraction task must be conducted with low accelerating voltages resulting in low imaging resolutions. This is imposed by the necessity of preserving the biochemical integrity of the sample. Such poor imaging conditions make the identification of nanometer-sized fiducial marks difficult. This paper presents an affine scale-invariant feature transform (ASIFT) based method for correlating SEM images and fluorescence microscopy images. The performance of the image correlation approach under different noise levels and imaging magnifications was quantitatively evaluated. The optimal mean absolute error (MAE) of correlation results is 68&#177;34&#8197;nm under standard conditions. Compared with manual correlation by skilled operators, the automated correlation approach demonstrates a speed that is higher by an order of magnitude. With the SEM-fluorescence image correlation approach, targeted DNA was successfully extracted via nanomanipulation under SEM conditions.</p>",[],True,"[""Zheng Gong"", ""Brandon K Chen"", ""Jun Liu"", ""Chao Zhou"", ""Dave Anchel"", ""Xiao Li"", ""Ji Ge"", ""David P Bazett-Jones"", ""Yu Sun""]","Gong, Z., Chen, B., Liu, J. et al.
