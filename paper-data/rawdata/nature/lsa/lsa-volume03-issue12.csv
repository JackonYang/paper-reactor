original article,Surface plasmon excitation in semitransparent inverted polymer photovoltaic devices and their applications as label-free optical sensors,"<p>Herein, we report on surface plasmon (SP)-sensitive semitransparent inverted polymer photovoltaic (PV) devices that are based on multilayered material systems consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene): fullerene-derivative bulk-heterojunction PV layers and thin gold or silver anodes. We demonstrate that these PV devices allow the simultaneous generation of both electrical power and SPs on their anodes for photoexcitation just above the optical absorption edge of the PV layers, resulting not only in attenuated total reflection, but also in attenuated photocurrent generation (APG) under the SP resonance (SPR) condition. Moreover, we also confirm that the biomolecular interaction of biotin&#8211;streptavidin on the PV devices can be precisely detected via apparent SPR angle shifts in the APG spectra, even without the need for complex attenuated total reflection configurations. We highlight our view that APG measurements made using these PV devices show great potential for the development of future generations of compact and highly sensitive SPR-based optical sensors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Biological Physics, Kwangwoon University, Seoul 139-701, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Byoungchoo Park', ',\xa0Soo Hong Yun', ',\xa0Chan Youn Cho', ',\xa0Young Chan Kim', ',\xa0Jung Chul Shin', ',\xa0Hong Goo Jeon', ',\xa0Yoon Ho Huh', ',\xa0Ku Youn Baik', ',\xa0Young In Lee', ',\xa0Han Sup Uhm', ',\xa0Guang Sup Cho', '\xa0&\xa0Eun Ha Choi']}, {'address': 'Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul 139-701, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Inchan Hwang']}]",True,"['Byoungchoo Park', 'Soo Hong Yun', 'Chan Youn Cho', 'Young Chan Kim', 'Jung Chul Shin', 'Hong Goo Jeon', 'Yoon Ho Huh', 'Inchan Hwang', 'Ku Youn Baik', 'Young In Lee', 'Han Sup Uhm', 'Guang Sup Cho', 'Eun Ha Choi']","Park, B., Yun, S., Cho, C. et al.

original article,DNA-assembled bimetallic plasmonic nanosensors,"<p>Plasmonic hybrid nanomaterials are highly desirable in advanced sensing applications. Different components in these materials undertake distinct roles and work collectively. One material component may act as an efficient light concentrator and optical probe, whereas another provides specific chemical or biological functionality. In this work, we present DNA-assembled bimetallic plasmonic nanostructures and demonstrate their application for the all-optical detection of hydrogen. Gold (Au) nanorods are functionalized with DNA strands, which serve both as linkers and seeding sites for the growth of palladium (Pd) nanocrystals and facilitate reliable positioning of Pd satellites around an Au nanorod at an ultrashort spacing in the nanometer range. Dark-field scattering spectra of single Au&#8211;DNA&#8211;Pd nanorods were recorded during controlled cycles of hydrogen gas exposure, and an unambiguous concentration-dependent optical response was observed. Our method enables, for the first time, the all-optical detection of hydrogen-induced phase-change processes in sub-5-nm Pd nanocrystals at the single-antenna level. By substituting the Pd satellites with other functional materials, our sensor platform can be extended to plasmonic sensing of a multitude of chemical and biological reagents, both in liquid and gaseous phases.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing 100190, China', 'authors': ['Na Li', ',\xa0Chen Song', '\xa0&\xa0Baoquan Ding']}, {'address': '4th Physics Institute and Research Center Scope, University of Stuttgart, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany', 'authors': ['Andreas Tittl', '\xa0&\xa0Harald Giessen']}, {'address': 'Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany', 'authors': ['Song Yue', '\xa0&\xa0Na Liu']}]",True,"['Na Li', 'Andreas Tittl', 'Song Yue', 'Harald Giessen', 'Chen Song', 'Baoquan Ding', 'Na Liu']","Li, N., Tittl, A., Yue, S. et al.
