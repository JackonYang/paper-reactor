original article,In-channel integration of designable microoptical devices using flat scaffold-supported femtosecond-laser microfabrication for coupling-free optofluidic cell counting,"<p>The high-precision integration of three-dimensional (3D) microoptical components into microfluidics in a customizable manner is crucial for optical sensing, fluorescence analysis, and cell detection in optofluidic applications; however, it remains challenging for current microfabrication technologies. This paper reports the in-channel integration of flexible two-dimensional (2D) and 3D polymer microoptical devices into glass microfluidics by developing a novel technique: flat scaffold-supported hybrid femtosecond laser microfabrication (FSS-HFLM). The scaffold with an optimal thickness of 1&#8211;5&#8197;&#181;m is fabricated on the lower internal surface of a microfluidic channel to improve the integration of high-precision microoptical devices on the scaffold by eliminating any undulated internal channel surface caused by wet etching. As a proof of demonstration, two types of typical microoptical devices, namely, 2D Fresnel zone plates (FZPs) and 3D refractive microlens arrays (MLAs), are integrated. These devices exhibit multicolor focal spots, elongated (&gt;three times) focal length and imaging of the characters &#8216;RIKEN&#8217; in a liquid channel. The resulting optofluidic chips are further used for coupling-free white-light cell counting with a success rate as high as 93%. An optofluidic system with two MLAs and a W-filter is also designed and fabricated for more advanced cell filtering/counting applications.</p>",[],True,"[""Dong Wu"", ""Jian Xu"", ""Li-Gang Niu"", ""Si-Zhu Wu"", ""Katsumi Midorikawa"", ""Koji Sugioka""]","Wu, D., Xu, J., Niu, LG. et al.

original article,Subdiffraction optical manipulation of the charge state of nitrogen vacancy center in diamond,"<p>As a potential candidate for quantum computation and metrology, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond presents both challenges and opportunities resulting from charge-state conversion. By utilizing different lasers for the photon-induced charge-state conversion, we achieved subdiffraction charge-state manipulation. The charge-state depletion (CSD) microscopy resolution was improved to 4.1&#8197;nm by optimizing the laser pulse sequences. Subsequently, the electron spin-state dynamics of adjacent NV centers were selectively detected via the CSD. The experimental results demonstrated that the CSD can improve the spatial resolution of the measurement of NV centers for nanoscale sensing and quantum information.</p>",[],True,"[""Xiangdong Chen"", ""Changling Zou"", ""Zhaojun Gong"", ""Chunhua Dong"", ""Guangcan Guo"", ""Fangwen Sun""]","Chen, X., Zou, C., Gong, Z. et al.

original article,Highly efficient hybrid warm white organic light-emitting diodes using a blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter: exploiting the external heavy-atom effect,"<p>To attain high efficiencies in hybrid white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs), mutual quenching of the fluorophors and phosphors should be minimized. Efforts have been devoted to reducing the triplet quenching of phosphors; however, the quenching of fluorophors by the external heavy-atom effect (EHA) introduced by the phosphors is often ignored. Here, we observed that conventional fluorophors and fluorophors with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) behave differently in the presence of EHA perturbers. The efficiencies of the conventional fluorophors suffer greatly from the EHA, whereas the TADF fluorophors exhibit negligible changes, which makes TADF materials ideal fluorophors for hybrid devices. WOLEDs using a blue TADF fluorophor and an orange phosphor achieve a maximum forward viewing external quantum efficiency of 19.6% and a maximum forward viewing power efficiency of 50.2&#8197;lm&#8197;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, among the best values for hybrid WOLEDs. This report is the first time that the EHA effect has been considered in hybrid WOLEDs and that a general strategy toward highly efficient hybrid WOLEDs with simple structures is proposed.</p>",[],True,"[""Dongdong Zhang"", ""Lian Duan"", ""Yunge Zhang"", ""Minghan Cai"", ""Deqiang Zhang"", ""Yong Qiu""]","Zhang, D., Duan, L., Zhang, Y. et al.

original article,Integrated colloidal quantum dot photodetectors with color-tunable plasmonic nanofocusing lenses,"<p>High-sensitivity photodetection is at the heart of many optoelectronic applications, including spectroscopy, imaging, surveillance, remote sensing and medical diagnostics. Achieving the highest possible sensitivity for a given photodetector technology requires the development of ultra-small-footprint detectors, as the noise sources scale with the area of the detector. This must be accomplished while sacrificing neither the optically active area of the detector nor its responsivity. Currently, such designs are based on diffraction-limited approaches using optical lenses. Here, we employ a plasmonic flat-lens bull&#8217;s eye structure (BES) to concentrate and focus light into a nanoscale colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photodetector. The plasmonic lenses function as nanofocusing resonant structures that simultaneously offer color selectivity and enhanced sensitivity. Herein, we demonstrate the first CQD photodetector with a nanoscale footprint, the optically active area of which is determined by the BES; this detector represents an exciting opportunity for high-sensitivity sensing.</p>",[],True,"[""Silke L Diedenhofen"", ""Dominik Kufer"", ""Tania Lasanta"", ""Gerasimos Konstantatos""]","Diedenhofen, S., Kufer, D., Lasanta, T. et al.

original article,Laser-induced white-light emission from graphene ceramics–opening a band gap in graphene,"<p>Recent theoretical and experimental studies have indicated the existence of a new stable phase of carbon with mixed sp<sup>2</sup> and sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized bonds&#8212;diaphite. Such a two-layered structure with sp<sup>2</sup>/sp<sup>3</sup> bonds may be observed after the photostimulation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphene with femtosecond laser pulses. This hidden multistability of graphene may be used to create a semiconducting phase immersed in the semimetallic continuum, resulting in bandgap opening. We demonstrate that bandgap opening and light emission from graphene is possible using continuous-wave laser beams with wavelengths from the visible (405&#8197;nm) to the near-infrared range (975&#8197;nm). We demonstrate that without the application of cooling, the effective temperature of the emitting sample remains lower than 900&#8197;K, which is far below the value predicted by the theory of black-body radiation. Moreover, light emission from a graphene sample may be observed at temperatures as low as 10&#8197;K.</p>",[],True,"[""Wieslaw Strek"", ""Bartlomiej Cichy"", ""Lukasz Radosinski"", ""Pawel Gluchowski"", ""Lukasz Marciniak"", ""Mikolaj Lukaszewicz"", ""Dariusz Hreniak""]","Strek, W., Cichy, B., Radosinski, L. et al.

original article,Observation of efficient population of the red-emitting state from the green state by non-multiphonon relaxation in the Er3+–Yb3+ system,"<p>The rare earth Er<sup>3+</sup> and Yb<sup>3+</sup> codoped system is the most attractive for showcasing energy transfer upconversion. This system can generate green and red emissions from Er<sup>3+</sup> under infrared excitation of the sensitizer Yb<sup>3+</sup>. It is well known that the red-emitting state can be populated from the upper green-emitting state. The contribution of multiphonon relaxation to this population is generally considered important at low excitation densities. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the importance of a previously proposed but neglected mechanism described as a cross relaxation energy transfer from Er<sup>3+</sup> to Yb<sup>3+</sup>, followed by an energy back transfer within the same Er<sup>3+</sup>&#8211;Yb<sup>3+</sup> pair. A luminescence spectroscopy study of cubic Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Er<sup>3+</sup>, Yb<sup>3+</sup> indicates that this mechanism can be more efficient than multiphonon relaxation, and it can even make a major contribution to the red upconversion. The study also revealed that the energy transfers involved in this mechanism take place only in the nearest Er<sup>3+</sup>&#8211;Yb<sup>3+</sup> pairs, and thus, it is fast and efficient at low excitation densities. Our results enable a better understanding of upconversion processes and properties in the Er<sup>3+</sup>&#8211;Yb<sup>3+</sup> system.</p>",[],True,"[""Jiahua Zhang"", ""Zhendong Hao"", ""Jing Li"", ""Xia Zhang"", ""Yongshi Luo"", ""Guohui Pan""]","Zhang, J., Hao, Z., Li, J. et al.

original article,Quantum nonlocal effects in individual and interacting graphene nanoribbons,"<p>We show that highly doped graphene ribbons can support surface plasmons at near-infrared frequencies when their width is in the nanometer range, leading to important nonlocal and finite quantum-size corrections, such as sizable blueshifts. The magnitude of these effects is assessed by comparing classical and quantum-mechanical models to describe graphene plasmons. More precisely, we examine individual and interacting 6&#8211;8&#8197;nm wide zigzag and armchair ribbons doped to 0.4&#8211;1.5&#8197;eV Fermi energies. We find a strong influence of nonlocal effects on the orientation of graphene edges, with plasmons in zigzag ribbons undergoing strong quenching when their energy is below the Fermi level. Nonlocality is also affecting the hybridization between ribbon plasmons in dimers and arrays for separations below a few nanometers. Remarkably, the removal of a single row of atomic bonds in a ribbon produces a strong plasmon frequency shift, whereas the removal of bonds along an array of rows separated by several nanometers in an extended sheet causes a dramatic increase in the absorption. Besides the fundamental interest of these results, our work supports the use of narrow ribbons to achieve electro-optical modulation in the near infrared.</p>",[],True,"[""Iv\u00e1n Silveiro"", ""Juan Manuel Plaza Ortega"", ""F Javier Garc\u00eda de Abajo""]","Silveiro, I., Ortega, J. & de Abajo, F.

original article,High refractive index of melanin in shiny occipital feathers of a bird of paradise,"<p>Male Lawes's Parotia, a bird of paradise, use the highly directional reflection of the structurally colored, brilliant-silvery occipital feathers in their courtship display. As in other birds, the structural coloration is produced by ordered melanin pigmentation. The barbules of the Parotia's occipital feathers, with thickness &#8764;3&#8197;&#181;m, contain 6&#8211;7 layers of densely packed melanin rodlets (diameter &#8764;0.25&#8197;&#181;m, length &#8764;2&#8197;&#181;m). The effectively &#8764;0.2&#8197;&#181;m thick melanin layers separated by &#8764;0.2&#8197;&#181;m thick keratin layers create a multilayer interference reflector. Reflectance measurements yielded peak wavelengths in the near-infrared at &#8764;1.3&#8197;&#181;m, i.e., far outside the visible wavelength range. With the Jamin-Lebedeff interference microscopy method recently developed for pigmented media, we here determined the refractive index of the intact barbules. We thus derived the wavelength dependence of the refractive index of the barbules' melanin to be 1.7&#8211;1.8 in the visible wavelength range. Implementing the anatomical and refractive index data in an optical multilayer model, we calculated the barbules' reflectance, transmittance and absorptance spectra, thereby confirming measured spectra.</p>",[],True,"[""Doekele G Stavenga"", ""Hein L Leertouwer"", ""Daniel C Osorio"", ""Bodo D Wilts""]","Stavenga, D., Leertouwer, H., Osorio, D. et al.

The underlying energy band structure corresponding to such highly efficient direct bandgap-like emissions in our surface-modified silicon quantum dots is unraveled by analyzing the transient optical spectrum, which demonstrates the significant effect of surface molecular engineering. It is observed that special surface modification, which creates novel surface states, is responsible for the different emission wavelengths and the significant improvement in the photoluminescence quantum yields.
