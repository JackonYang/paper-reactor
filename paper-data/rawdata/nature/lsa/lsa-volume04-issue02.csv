original article,Get it white: color-tunable AC/DC OLEDs,"<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have gained considerable attention because of their use of inherently flexible materials and their compatibility with facile roll-to-roll and printing processes. In addition to high efficiency, flexibility and transparency, reliable color tunability of solid state light sources is a desirable feature in the lighting and display industry. Here, we demonstrate a device concept for highly efficient organic light-emitting devices whose emission color can be easily adjusted from deep-blue through cold-white and warm-white to saturated yellow. Our approach exploits the different polarities of the positive and negative half-cycles of an alternating current (AC) driving signal to independently address a fluorescent blue emission unit and a phosphorescent yellow emission unit which are vertically stacked on top of each other. The electrode design is optimized for simple fabrication and driving and allows for two-terminal operation by a single source. The presented concept for color-tunable OLEDs is compatible with application requirements and versatile in terms of emitter combinations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Applied Photophysics (IAPP), Dresden University of Technology, D-01069 Dresden, Germany', 'authors': ['Markus Fröbel', ',\xa0Tobias Schwab', ',\xa0Mona Kliem', ',\xa0Simone Hofmann', ',\xa0Karl Leo', '\xa0&\xa0Malte C Gather']}, {'address': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews, St Andrews KY16 9SS, UK', 'authors': ['Malte C Gather']}]",True,"['Markus Fröbel', 'Tobias Schwab', 'Mona Kliem', 'Simone Hofmann', 'Karl Leo', 'Malte C Gather']","Fröbel, M., Schwab, T., Kliem, M. et al.

original article,A single-molecule multicolor electrochromic device generated through medium engineering,"<p>Multicolor organic electrochromic materials are important for the generation of full-color devices. However, achieving multiple colors using a single-molecule material has proved challenging. In this study, a multicolor electrochromic prototype device is generated by integrating medium engineering/in situ &#8216;electro base&#8217;/laminated electrode technologies with the simple flying fish-shaped methyl ketone TM1. This multicolor electrochromic (green, blue and magenta) device is durable and has a high coloration efficiency (350&#8197;cm<sup>2</sup>&#8197;C<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), a fast switching time (50&#8197;ms) and superior reversibility. This study is a successful attempt to integrate solvatochromism and basochromism in an electronic display. This integration not only introduces a new avenue for color tuning, in addition to the structural design of the colorant, but will also inspire further developments in the tuning of many other properties by this medium engineering approach, such as conductance and the redox property, and thereby accelerate versatile applications in data recording, ultrathin flexible displays, and optical communication and sensing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University, Changchun 130012, China', 'authors': ['Yu-Mo Zhang', ',\xa0Xiaojun Wang', ',\xa0Weiran Zhang', ',\xa0Wen Li', ',\xa0Xiaofeng Fang', ',\xa0Bing Yang', ',\xa0Minjie Li', '\xa0&\xa0Sean Xiao-An Zhang']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Zhuhai College of Jilin University, Zhuhai 519041, China', 'authors': ['Sean Xiao-An Zhang']}]",True,"['Yu-Mo Zhang', 'Xiaojun Wang', 'Weiran Zhang', 'Wen Li', 'Xiaofeng Fang', 'Bing Yang', 'Minjie Li', 'Sean Xiao-An Zhang']","Zhang, Y., Wang, X., Zhang, W. et al.A single-molecule multicolor electrochromic device generated through medium engineering.

original article,Carrier multiplication in germanium nanocrystals,"<p>Carrier multiplication is demonstrated in a solid-state dispersion of germanium nanocrystals in a silicon&#8211;dioxide matrix. This is performed by comparing ultrafast photo-induced absorption transients at different pump photon energies below and above the threshold energy for this process. The average germanium nanocrystal size is approximately 5&#8211;6&#8197;nm, as inferred from photoluminescence and Raman spectra. A carrier multiplication efficiency of approximately 190% is measured for photo-excitation at 2.8 times the optical bandgap of germanium nanocrystals, deduced from their photoluminescence spectra.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Van der Waals-Zeeman Institute, University of Amsterdam, 1098 XH Amsterdam, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Saba Saeed', ',\xa0Chris de Weerd', ',\xa0Peter Stallinga', '\xa0&\xa0Tom Gregorkiewicz']}, {'address': 'FCT-DEEI, University of the Algarve, 8005-139 Faro, Portugal', 'authors': ['Peter Stallinga']}, {'address': 'Optoelectronic Materials, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Delft University of Technology, 2628 BL Delft, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Frank CM Spoor', ',\xa0Arjan J Houtepen', '\xa0&\xa0Laurens DA Siebbeles']}]",True,"['Saba Saeed', 'Chris de Weerd', 'Peter Stallinga', 'Frank CM Spoor', 'Arjan J Houtepen', 'Laurens DA Siebbeles', 'Tom Gregorkiewicz']","Saeed, S., de Weerd, C., Stallinga, P. et al.

original article,Broadband tunable liquid crystal terahertz waveplates driven with porous graphene electrodes,"<p>Versatile devices, especially tunable ones, for terahertz imaging, sensing and high-speed communication, are in high demand. Liquid crystal based components are perfect candidates in the optical range; however, they encounter significant challenges in the terahertz band, particularly the lack of highly transparent electrodes and the drawbacks induced by a thick cell. Here, a strategy to overcome all these challenges is proposed: Few-layer porous graphene is employed as an electrode with a transmittance of more than 98%. A subwavelength metal wire grid is utilized as an integrated high-efficiency electrode and polarizer. The homogeneous alignment of a high-birefringence liquid crystal is implemented on both frail electrodes via a non-contact photo-alignment technique. A tunable terahertz waveplate is thus obtained. Its polarization evolution is directly demonstrated. Furthermore, quarter-wave plates that are electrically controllable over the entire testing range are achieved by stacking two cells. The proposed solution may pave a simple and bright road toward the development of various liquid crystal terahertz apparatuses.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures and College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China', 'authors': ['Lei Wang', ',\xa0Xiao-Wen Lin', ',\xa0Wei Hu', ',\xa0Guang-Hao Shao', ',\xa0Peng Chen', ',\xa0Zhi-Gang Zheng', '\xa0&\xa0Yan-Qing Lu']}, {'address': 'Research Institute of Superconductor Electronics (RISE), School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China', 'authors': ['Lan-Ju Liang', ',\xa0Biao-Bing Jin', '\xa0&\xa0Pei-Heng Wu']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Materials Oriented Chemical Engineering, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing 210009, China', 'authors': ['Hao Qian', '\xa0&\xa0Yi-Nong Lu']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China', 'authors': ['Xiao Liang']}]",True,"['Lei Wang', 'Xiao-Wen Lin', 'Wei Hu', 'Guang-Hao Shao', 'Peng Chen', 'Lan-Ju Liang', 'Biao-Bing Jin', 'Pei-Heng Wu', 'Hao Qian', 'Yi-Nong Lu', 'Xiao Liang', 'Zhi-Gang Zheng', 'Yan-Qing Lu']","Wang, L., Lin, X., Hu, W. et al.

original article,Femtojoule electro-optic modulation using a silicon–organic hybrid device,"<p>Energy-efficient electro-optic modulators are at the heart of short-reach optical interconnects, and silicon photonics is considered the leading technology for realizing such devices. However, the performance of all-silicon devices is limited by intrinsic material properties. In particular, the absence of linear electro-optic effects in silicon renders the integration of energy-efficient photonic&#8211;electronic interfaces challenging. Silicon&#8211;organic hybrid (SOH) integration can overcome these limitations by combining nanophotonic silicon waveguides with organic cladding materials, thereby offering the prospect of designing optical properties by molecular engineering. In this paper, we demonstrate an SOH Mach&#8211;Zehnder modulator with unprecedented efficiency: the 1-mm-long device consumes only 0.7&#8197;fJ&#8197;bit<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to generate a 12.5&#8197;Gbit&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> data stream with a bit-error ratio below the threshold for hard-decision forward-error correction. This power consumption represents the lowest value demonstrated for a non-resonant Mach&#8211;Zehnder modulator in any material system. It is enabled by a novel class of organic electro-optic materials that are designed for high chromophore density and enhanced molecular orientation. The device features an electro-optic coefficient of r<sub>33</sub>&#8776;180&#8197;pm&#8197;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and can be operated at data rates of up to 40&#8197;Gbit&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Photonics and Quantum Electronics (IPQ) and Institute of Microstructure Technology (IMT), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany', 'authors': ['Sebastian Koeber', ',\xa0Robert Palmer', ',\xa0Matthias Lauermann', ',\xa0Wolfgang Heni', ',\xa0Dietmar Korn', ',\xa0Markus Woessner', ',\xa0Luca Alloatti', ',\xa0Swen Koenig', ',\xa0Philipp C Schindler', ',\xa0Wolfgang Freude', ',\xa0Juerg Leuthold', '\xa0&\xa0Christian Koos']}, {'address': 'Now with:, Institute of Electromagnetic Fields, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Wolfgang Heni', '\xa0&\xa0Juerg Leuthold']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1700, USA', 'authors': ['Delwin L Elder', '\xa0&\xa0Larry R Dalton']}, {'address': 'Now with:, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Research Lab of Electronics (RLE), Cambridge, MA 02139, USA', 'authors': ['Luca Alloatti']}, {'address': 'Now with:, Infinera Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Swen Koenig', '\xa0&\xa0Philipp C Schindler']}, {'address': 'Department of Information Technology, Ghent University – IMEC, Photonics Research Group, Gent, Belgium', 'authors': ['Hui Yu', '\xa0&\xa0Wim Bogaerts']}, {'address': 'Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Now with:, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China', 'authors': ['Hui Yu']}]",True,"['Sebastian Koeber', 'Robert Palmer', 'Matthias Lauermann', 'Wolfgang Heni', 'Delwin L Elder', 'Dietmar Korn', 'Markus Woessner', 'Luca Alloatti', 'Swen Koenig', 'Philipp C Schindler', 'Hui Yu', 'Wim Bogaerts', 'Larry R Dalton', 'Wolfgang Freude', 'Juerg Leuthold', 'Christian Koos']","Koeber, S., Palmer, R., Lauermann, M. et al.
