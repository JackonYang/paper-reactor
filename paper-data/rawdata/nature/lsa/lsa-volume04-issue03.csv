original article,Massive individual orbital angular momentum channels for multiplexing enabled by Dammann gratings,"<p>Data transmission rates in optical communication systems are approaching the limits of conventional multiplexing methods. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) in optical vortex beams offers a new degree of freedom and the potential to increase the capacity of free-space optical communication systems, with OAM beams acting as information carriers for OAM division multiplexing (OAM-DM). We demonstrate independent collinear OAM channel generation, transmission and simultaneous detection using Dammann optical vortex gratings (DOVGs). We achieve 80/160&#8197;Tbit&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> capacity with uniform power distributions along all channels, with 1600 individually modulated quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)/16-QAM data channels multiplexed by 10 OAM states, 80 wavelengths and two polarizations. DOVG-enabled OAM multiplexing technology removes the bottleneck of massive OAM state parallel detection and offers an opportunity to raise optical communication systems capacity to Pbit&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> level.</p>",[],True,"[""Ting Lei"", ""Meng Zhang"", ""Yuru Li"", ""Ping Jia"", ""Gordon Ning Liu"", ""Xiaogeng Xu"", ""Zhaohui Li"", ""Changjun Min"", ""Jiao Lin"", ""Changyuan Yu"", ""Hanben Niu"", ""Xiaocong Yuan""]","Lei, T., Zhang, M., Li, Y. et al.

original article,A high-resolution optically addressed spatial light modulator based on ZnO nanoparticles,"<p>An optically addressed spatial light modulator (OASLM) can modulate the wavefront of a read light by displaying a phase pattern or a hologram configured by the intensity distribution of a write light. Using ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) as a novel photoconductor, a high-resolution OASLM was fabricated. A ZnO NP suspension was spin-coated on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate and annealed to form a photosensitive layer. The device was characterized electrically and optically. The device was operated at low driving voltages in the transmission mode. Updatable recording of a diffraction grating up to 825&#8197;lp mm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with a diffraction efficiency (DE) of 0.05% and binary holograms with pixel sizes from 2&#8197;&#181;m down to 0.72&#8197;&#181;m were demonstrated using a 405&#8197;nm wavelength write laser and a 635&#8197;nm wavelength read laser.</p>",[],True,"[""Pawan Kumar Shrestha"", ""Young Tea Chun"", ""Daping Chu""]","Shrestha, P., Chun, Y. & Chu, D.

original article,Synthetic aperture-based on-chip microscopy,"<p>Wide field-of-view (FOV) and high-resolution imaging requires microscopy modalities to have large space-bandwidth products. Lensfree on-chip microscopy decouples resolution from FOV and can achieve a space-bandwidth product greater than one billion under unit magnification using state-of-the-art opto-electronic sensor chips and pixel super-resolution techniques. However, using vertical illumination, the effective numerical aperture (NA) that can be achieved with an on-chip microscope is limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at high spatial frequencies and imaging artifacts that arise as a result of the relatively narrow acceptance angles of the sensor's pixels. Here, we report, for the first time, a synthetic aperture-based on-chip microscope in which the illumination angle is scanned across the surface of a dome to increase the effective NA of the reconstructed lensfree image to 1.4, achieving e.g., &#8764;250-nm resolution at 700-nm wavelength under unit magnification. This synthetic aperture approach not only represents the largest NA achieved to date using an on-chip microscope but also enables color imaging of connected tissue samples, such as pathology slides, by achieving robust phase recovery without the need for multi-height scanning or any prior information about the sample. To validate the effectiveness of this synthetic aperture-based, partially coherent, holographic on-chip microscope, we have successfully imaged color-stained cancer tissue slides as well as unstained Papanicolaou smears across a very large FOV of 20.5 mm<sup>2</sup>. This compact on-chip microscope based on a synthetic aperture approach could be useful for various applications in medicine, physical sciences and engineering that demand high-resolution wide-field imaging.</p>",[],True,"[""Wei Luo"", ""Alon Greenbaum"", ""Yibo Zhang"", ""Aydogan Ozcan""]","Luo, W., Greenbaum, A., Zhang, Y. et al.

original article,Microsecond scale vibrational spectroscopic imaging by multiplex stimulated Raman scattering microscopy,"<p>Real-time vibrational spectroscopic imaging is desired for monitoring cellular states and cellular processes in a label-free manner. Raman spectroscopic imaging of highly dynamic systems is inhibited by relatively slow spectral acquisition on millisecond to second scale. Here, we report microsecond scale vibrational spectroscopic imaging by lock-in free parallel detection of spectrally dispersed stimulated Raman scattering signal. Using a homebuilt tuned amplifier array, our method enables Raman spectral acquisition, within the window defined by the broadband pulse, at the speed of 32 &#181;s and with close to shot-noise limited detection sensitivity. Incorporated with multivariate curve resolution analysis, our platform allows compositional mapping of lipid droplets in single live cells, observation of intracellular retinoid metabolism, discrimination of fat droplets from protein-rich organelles in Caenorhabditis elegans, spectral detection of fast flowing tumor cells and monitoring drug diffusion through skin tissue in vivo. The reported technique opens new opportunities for compositional analysis of cellular compartment in a microscope setting and high-throughput spectral profiling of single cells in a flow cytometer setting.</p>",[],True,"[""Chien-Sheng Liao"", ""Mikhail N Slipchenko"", ""Ping Wang"", ""Junjie Li"", ""Seung-Young Lee"", ""Robert A Oglesbee"", ""Ji-Xin Cheng""]","Liao, CS., Slipchenko, M., Wang, P. et al.

original article,Bioinspired optical antennas: gold plant viruses,"<p>The ability to capture the chemical signatures of biomolecules (i.e., electron-transfer dynamics) in living cells will provide an entirely new perspective on biology and medicine. This can be accomplished using nanoscale optical antennas that can collect, resonate and focus light from outside the cell and emit molecular spectra. Here, we describe biologically inspired nanoscale optical antennas that utilize the unique topologies of plant viruses (and thus, are called gold plant viruses) for molecular fingerprint detection. Our electromagnetic calculations for these gold viruses indicate that capsid morphologies permit high amplification of optical scattering energy compared to a smooth nanosphere. From experimental measurements of various gold viruses based on four different plant viruses, we observe highly enhanced optical cross-sections and the modulation of the resonance wavelength depending on the viral morphology. Additionally, in label-free molecular imaging, we successfully obtain higher sensitivity (by a factor of up to 10<sup>6</sup>) than can be achieved using similar-sized nanospheres. By virtue of the inherent functionalities of capsids and the plasmonic characteristics of the gold layer, a gold virus-based antenna will enable cellular targeting, imaging and drug delivery.</p>",[],True,"[""SoonGweon Hong"", ""Mi Yeon Lee"", ""Andrew O Jackson"", ""Luke P Lee""]","Hong, S., Lee, M., Jackson, A. et al.
