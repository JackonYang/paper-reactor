original article,Overcoming the fundamental light-extraction efficiency limitations of deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes by utilizing transverse-magnetic-dominant emission,"<p>While the demand for deep ultraviolet (DUV) light sources is rapidly growing, the efficiency of current AlGaN-based DUV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) remains very low due to their fundamentally limited light-extraction efficiency (LEE), calling for a novel LEE-enhancing approach to deliver a real breakthrough. Here, we propose sidewall emission-enhanced (SEE) DUV LEDs having multiple light-emitting mesa stripes to utilize inherently strong transverse-magnetic polarized light from the AlGaN active region and three-dimensional reflectors between the stripes. The SEE DUV LEDs show much enhanced light output power with a strongly upward-directed emission due to the exposed sidewall of the active region and Al-coated selective-area-grown n-type GaN micro-reflectors. The devices also show reduced operating voltage due to better n-type ohmic contact formed on the regrown n-GaN stripes when compared with conventional LEDs. Accordingly, the proposed approach simultaneously improves optical and electrical properties. In addition, strategies to further enhance the LEE up to the theoretical optimum value and control emission directionality are discussed.</p>",[],True,"[""Dong Yeong Kim"", ""Jun Hyuk Park"", ""Jong Won Lee"", ""Sunyong Hwang"", ""Seung Jae Oh"", ""Jungsub Kim"", ""Cheolsoo Sone"", ""E.

original article,High frame rate multi-resonance imaging refractometry with distributed feedback dye laser sensor,"<p>High frame rate and highly sensitive imaging of refractive index changes on a surface is very promising for studying the dynamics of dissolution, mixing and biological processes without the need for labeling. Here, a highly sensitive distributed feedback (DFB) dye laser sensor for high frame rate imaging refractometry without moving parts is presented. DFB dye lasers are low-cost and highly sensitive refractive index sensors. The unique multi-wavelength DFB laser structure presented here comprises several areas with different grating periods. Imaging in two dimensions of space is enabled by analyzing laser light from all areas in parallel with an imaging spectrometer. With this multi-resonance imaging refractometry method, the spatial position in one direction is identified from the horizontal, i.e., spectral position of the multiple laser lines which is obtained from the spectrometer charged coupled device (CCD) array. The orthogonal spatial position is obtained from the vertical spatial position on the spectrometer CCD array as in established spatially resolved spectroscopy. Here, the imaging technique is demonstrated by monitoring the motion of small sucrose molecules upon dissolution of solid sucrose in water. The omission of moving parts improves the robustness of the imaging system and allows a very high frame rate of up to 12 Hz.</p>",[],True,"[""Christoph Vannahme"", ""Martin Dufva"", ""Anders Kristensen""]","Vannahme, C., Dufva, M. & Kristensen, A.

original article,Biofunctionalized all-polymer photonic lab on a chip with integrated solid-state light emitter,"<p>A photonic lab on a chip (PhLOC), comprising a solid-state light emitter (SSLE) aligned with a biofunctionalized optofluidic multiple internal reflection (MIR) system, is presented. The SSLE is obtained by filling a microfluidic structure with a phenyltrimethoxysilane (PhTMOS) aqueous sol solution containing a fluorophore organic dye. After curing, the resulting xerogel solid structure retains the emitting properties of the fluorophore, which is evenly distributed in the xerogel matrix. Photostability studies demonstrate that after a total dose (at &#955;=365&#8197;nm) greater than 24&#8197;J&#8197;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, the xerogel emission decay is only 4.1%. To re-direct the emitted light, the SSLE includes two sets of air mirrors that surround the xerogel. Emission mapping of the SSLE demonstrates that alignment variations of 150&#8197;&#181;m (between the SSLE and the external pumping light source) provide fluctuations in emitted light smaller than 5%. After this verification, the SSLE is monolithically implemented with a MIR, forming the PhLOC. Its performance is assessed by measuring quinolone yellow, obtaining a limit of detection (LOD) of (0.60&#177;0.01)&#8197;&#181;M. Finally, the MIR is selectively biofunctionalized with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) target analyte, obtaining a LOD of (0.7&#177;0.1)&#8197;&#181;M for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, confirming, for the first time, that solid-state xerogel-based emitters can be massively implemented in biofunctionalized PhLOCs.</p>",[],True,"[""Andreu Llobera"", ""Joan Juvert"", ""Alfredo Gonz\u00e1lez-Fern\u00e1ndez"", ""Bergoi Ibarlucea"", ""Ester Carregal-Romero"", ""Stephanus B\u00fcttgenbach"", ""C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez""]","Llobera, A., Juvert, J., González-Fernández, A. et al.

original article,MoOx and V2Ox as hole and electron transport layers through functionalized intercalation in normal and inverted organic optoelectronic devices,"<p>To achieve fabrication and cost competitiveness in organic optoelectronic devices that include organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), it is desirable to have one type of material that can simultaneously function as both the electron and hole transport layers (ETLs and HTLs) of the organic devices in all device architectures (i.e., normal and inverted architectures). We address this issue by proposing and demonstrating Cs-intercalated metal oxides (with various Cs mole ratios) as both the ETL and HTL of an organic optoelectronic device with normal and inverted device architectures. Our results demonstrate that the new approach works well for widely used transition metal oxides of molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>x</sub>) and vanadium oxide (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x</sub>). Moreover, the Cs-intercalated metal-oxide-based ETL and HTL can be easily formed under the conditions of a room temperature, water-free and solution-based process. These conditions favor practical applications of OSCs and OLEDs. Notably, with the analyses of the Kelvin Probe System, our approach of Cs-intercalated metal oxides with a wide mole ratio range of transition metals (Mo or V)/Cs from 1&#8758;0 to 1&#8758;0.75 can offer significant and continuous work function tuning as large as 1.31 eV for functioning as both an ETL and HTL. Consequently, our method of intercalated metal oxides can contribute to the emerging large-scale and low-cost organic optoelectronic devices.</p>",[],True,"[""Xinchen Li"", ""Fengxian Xie"", ""Shaoqing Zhang"", ""Jianhui Hou"", ""Wallace CH Choy""]","Li, X., Xie, F., Zhang, S. et al.

original article,Secret key exchange in ultralong lasers by radiofrequency spectrum coding,"<p>We propose a new approach to the generation of an alphabet for secret key exchange relying on small variations in the cavity length of an ultralong fiber laser. This new concept is supported by experimental results showing how the radiofrequency spectrum of the laser can be exploited as a carrier to exchange information. The test bench for our proof of principle is a 50-km-long fiber laser linking two users, Alice and Bob, where each user can randomly add an extra 1-km-long segment of fiber. The choice of laser length is driven by two independent random binary values, which makes such length become itself a random variable. The security of key exchange is ensured whenever the two independent random choices lead to the same laser length and, hence, to the same free spectral range.</p>",[],True,"[""Alessandro Tonello"", ""Alain Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my"", ""Katarzyna Krupa"", ""Vincent Kerm\u00e8ne"", ""Agn\u00e8s Desfarges-Berthelemot"", ""Badr Mohamed Shalaby"", ""Sonia Boscolo"", ""Sergei K Turitsyn"", ""Juan Diego Ania-Casta\u00f1\u00f3n""]","Tonello, A., Barthélémy, A., Krupa, K. et al.

original article,Photon momentum transfer in inhomogeneous dielectric mixtures and induced tractor beams,"<p>The determination of optical force as a consequence of momentum transfer is inevitably subject to the use of the proper momentum density and stress tensor. It is imperative and valuable to consider the intrinsic scheme of photon momentum transfer, particularly when a particle is embedded in a complex dielectric environment. Typically, we consider a particle submerged in an inhomogeneous background composed of different dielectric materials, excluding coherent illumination or hydrodynamic effects. A ray-tracing method is adopted to capture the direct process of momentum transfer from the complex background medium, and this approach is validated using the modified Einstein&#8211;Laub method, which uses only the interior fields of the particle in the calculation. In this way, debates regarding the calculation of the force with different stress tensors using exterior fields can be avoided. Our suggested interpretation supports only the Minkowski approach for the optical momentum transfer to the embedded scatterer while rejecting Peierls's and Abraham's approaches, though the momentum of a stably moving photon in a continuous background medium should be considered to be of the Abraham type. Our interpretation also provides a novel method of realizing a tractor beam for the exertion of negative force that offers an alternative to the use of negative-index materials, optical gain, or highly non-paraxial or multiple-light interference.</p>",[],True,"[""Cheng-Wei Qiu"", ""Weiqiang Ding"", ""M.R.C.

original article,Optically controlled elastic microcavities,"<p>Whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators made from dielectrics like glass or polymers have outstanding optical properties like huge cavity quality (Q) factors which can be achieved on scales compatible with on-chip integration. However, tunability of these resonances is typically difficult to achieve or not suitable for robust device applications. We report here on the fabrication of polymeric micro-goblet WGM resonators with an optically controlled and stable reversible tunability over a large spectral range. This tunability is achieved by integration of photo-responsive liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) into micro-goblet cavities. The optical response of the elastomer allows reshaping the goblet by employing low pump power, leading to a fully reversible tuning of the modes. The structure can be realistically implemented in on-chip devices, combining the ultra-high Q factors, typical of WGM resonators, with reliable, optical tunability. This result serves as an example of how light can control light, by invoking a physical reshaping of the structure. This way of optical tuning creates interesting possibilities for all-optical control in circuits, enabling interaction between signal and control beams and the realization of self-tuning cavities.</p>",[],True,"[""Assegid Mengistu Flatae"", ""Matteo Burresi"", ""Hao Zeng"", ""Sara Nocentini"", ""Sarah Wiegele"", ""Camilla Parmeggiani"", ""Heinz Kalt"", ""Diederik Wiersma""]","Flatae, A., Burresi, M., Zeng, H. et al.
