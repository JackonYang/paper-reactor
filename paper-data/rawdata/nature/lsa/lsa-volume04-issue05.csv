original article,Tunable and switchable polarization rotation with non-reciprocal plasmonic thin films at designated wavelengths,"<p>We experimentally demonstrate an ultra-thin plasmonic optical rotator in the visible regime that induces a polarization rotation that is continuously tunable and switchable by an external magnetic field. The rotator is a magneto-plasmonic hybrid structure consisting of a magneto-optical EuSe slab and a one-dimensional plasmonic gold grating. At low temperatures, EuSe possesses a large Verdet constant and exhibits Faraday rotation, which does not saturate over a regime of several Tesla. By combining these properties with plasmonic Faraday rotation enhancement, a large tuning range of the polarization rotation of up to 8.4&#176; for a film thickness of 220 nm is achieved. Furthermore, through experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that the unique dispersion properties of the structure enable us to tailor the wavelengths of the tunable polarization rotation to arbitrary spectral positions within the transparency window of&#160;the magneto-optical slab. The demonstrated concept might lead to important, highly integrated, non-reciprocal, photonic devices for&#160;light modulation, optical isolation, and magnetic field optical sensing. The simple fabrication of EuSe nanostructures by physical vapor deposition opens the way for many potentially interesting magneto-plasmonic systems and three-dimensional magneto-optical metamaterials.</p>",,"[{'address': '4th Physics Institute and Research Center SCOPE, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, 70550, Germany', 'authors': ['Dominik Floess', ',\xa0Jessie Y Chin', ',\xa0Akihito Kawatani', ',\xa0Daniel Dregely', ',\xa0Thomas Weiss', '\xa0&\xa0Harald Giessen']}, {'address': 'Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart, 70569, Germany', 'authors': ['Hanns-Ulrich Habermeier']}]",True,"['Dominik Floess', 'Jessie Y Chin', 'Akihito Kawatani', 'Daniel Dregely', 'Hanns-Ulrich Habermeier', 'Thomas Weiss', 'Harald Giessen']","Floess, D., Chin, J., Kawatani, A. et al.

original article,Transforming the cost of solar-to-electrical energy conversion: Integrating thin-film GaAs solar cells with non-tracking mini-concentrators,"<p>Practical solar energy solutions must not only reduce the cost of the module, but also address the substantial balance of system costs. Here, we demonstrate a counter-intuitive approach based on gallium arsenide solar cells that can achieve extremely low-cost solar energy conversion with an estimated cost of only 3% that of conventional gallium arsenide solar cells using an accelerated, non-destructive epitaxial lift-off wafer recycling process along with a lightweight, thermoformed plastic, truncated mini-compound parabolic concentrator that avoids the need for active solar tracking. Using solar cell/concentrator assemblies whose orientations are adjusted only a few times per year, the annual energy harvesting is increased by 2.8 times compared with planar solar cells without solar tracking. These results represent a potentially drastic cost reduction in both the module and the balance of system costs compared with heavy, rigid conventional modules and trackers that are subject to wind loading damage and high installation costs.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, USA', 'authors': ['Kyusang Lee', ',\xa0Jaesang Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Stephen R Forrest']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, USA', 'authors': ['Bryan A Mazor', '\xa0&\xa0Stephen R Forrest']}, {'address': 'Department of Material Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, USA', 'authors': ['Stephen R Forrest']}]",True,"['Kyusang Lee', 'Jaesang Lee', 'Bryan A Mazor', 'Stephen R Forrest']","Lee, K., Lee, J., Mazor, B. et al.

original article,Giant photonic spin Hall effect in momentum space in a structured metamaterial with spatially varying birefringence,"<p>The photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) in the reflection and refraction at an interface is very weak because of the weak spin-orbit interaction. Here, we report the observation of a giant photonic SHE in a dielectric-based metamaterial. The metamaterial is structured to create a coordinate-dependent, geometric Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry phase that results in an SHE with a spin-dependent splitting in momentum space. It is unlike the SHE that occurs in real space in the reflection and refraction at an interface, which results from the momentum-dependent gradient of the geometric Rytov&#8211;Vladimirskii&#8211;Berry phase. We theorize a unified description of the photonic SHE based on the two types of geometric phase gradient, and we experimentally measure the giant spin-dependent shift of the beam centroid produced by the metamaterial at a visible wavelength. Our results suggest that the structured metamaterial offers a potential method of manipulating spin-polarized photons and the orbital angular momentum of light and thus enables applications in spin-controlled nanophotonics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory for Spin Photonics, School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan University, Changsha, 410082, China', 'authors': ['Xiaohui Ling', ',\xa0Xinxing Zhou', ',\xa0Weixing Shu', ',\xa0Yachao Liu', ',\xa0Shizhen Chen', ',\xa0Hailu Luo', ',\xa0Shuangchun Wen', '\xa0&\xa0Dianyuan Fan']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Electronic Information Science, Hengyang Normal University, Hengyang, 421002, China', 'authors': ['Xiaohui Ling']}, {'address': 'SZU-NUS Collaborative Innovation Center for Optoelectronic Science & Technology, and Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Devices and Systems of Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China', 'authors': ['Xiaohui Ling', ',\xa0Xunong Yi', '\xa0&\xa0Dianyuan Fan']}]",True,"['Xiaohui Ling', 'Xinxing Zhou', 'Xunong Yi', 'Weixing Shu', 'Yachao Liu', 'Shizhen Chen', 'Hailu Luo', 'Shuangchun Wen', 'Dianyuan Fan']","Ling, X., Zhou, X., Yi, X. et al.

original article,"Controlling light with light using coherent metadevices: all-optical transistor, summator and invertor","<p>Although vast amounts of information are conveyed by photons in optical fibers, the majority of data processing is performed electronically, creating the infamous &#8216;information bottleneck&#8217; and consuming energy at an increasingly unsustainable rate. The potential for photonic devices to directly manipulate light remains unfulfilled due largely to a lack of materials with strong, fast optical nonlinearities. In this paper, we show that small-signal amplifier, summator and invertor functions for optical signals may be realized using a four-port device that exploits the coherent interaction of beams on a planar plasmonic metamaterial, assuming no intrinsic nonlinearity. The redistribution of energy among ports can provide nonlinear input-output signal dependencies and may be coherently controlled at very low intensity levels, with multi-THz bandwidth and without introducing signal distortion, thereby presenting powerful opportunities for novel optical data processing architectures, complexity oracles and the locally coherent networks that are becoming part of the mainstream telecommunications agenda.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre & Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK', 'authors': ['Xu Fang', ',\xa0Kevin F MacDonald', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, TPI, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637371, Singapore', 'authors': ['Nikolay I Zheludev']}]",True,"['Xu Fang', 'Kevin F MacDonald', 'Nikolay I Zheludev']","Fang, X., MacDonald, K. & Zheludev, N.

review,Advances in InGaAs/InP single-photon detector systems for quantum communication,"<p>Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are the most sensitive instruments for light detection. In the near-infrared range, SPDs based on III&#8211;V compound semiconductor avalanche photodiodes have been extensively used during the past two decades for diverse applications due to their advantages in practicality including small size, low cost and easy operation. In the past decade, the rapid developments and increasing demands in quantum information science have served as key drivers to improve the device performance of single-photon avalanche diodes and to invent new avalanche quenching techniques. This Review aims to introduce the technology advances of InGaAs/InP single-photon detector systems in the telecom wavelengths and the relevant quantum communication applications, and particularly to highlight recent emerging techniques such as high-frequency gating at GHz rates and free-running operation using negative-feedback avalanche diodes. Future perspectives of both the devices and quenching techniques are summarized.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China', 'authors': ['Jun Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Jian-Wei Pan']}, {'address': 'CAS Center for Excellence and Synergetic Innovation Center in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China', 'authors': ['Jun Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Jian-Wei Pan']}, {'address': 'Princeton Lightwave Inc., 2555 US Route 130 S., Cranbury, 08540, NJ, USA', 'authors': ['Mark A Itzler']}, {'address': 'Group of Applied Physics, University of Geneva, Geneva, CH-1211, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Hugo Zbinden']}]",True,"['Jun Zhang', 'Mark A Itzler', 'Hugo Zbinden', 'Jian-Wei Pan']","Zhang, J., Itzler, M., Zbinden, H. et al.
