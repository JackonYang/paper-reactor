review,Nanoplasmonic waveguides: towards applications in integrated nanophotonic circuits,"<p>The properties of propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) along one-dimensional metal structures have been investigated for more than 10 years and are now well understood. Because of the high confinement of electromagnetic energy, propagating SPPs have been considered to represent one of the best potential ways to construct next-generation circuits that use light to overcome the speed limit of electronics. Many basic plasmonic components have already been developed. In this review, researches on plasmonic waveguides are reviewed from the perspective of plasmonic circuits. Several circuit components are constructed to demonstrate the basic function of an optical digital circuit. In the end of this review, a prototype for an SPP-based nanochip is proposed, and the problems associated with building such plasmonic circuits are discussed. A plasmonic chip that can be practically applied is expected to become available in the near future.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China', 'authors': ['Yurui Fang', '\xa0&\xa0Mengtao Sun']}, {'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, Göteborg, SE-412 96, Sweden', 'authors': ['Yurui Fang']}]",True,"['Yurui Fang', 'Mengtao Sun']","Fang, Y., Sun, M.

original article,Fano resonance boosted cascaded optical field enhancement in a plasmonic nanoparticle-in-cavity nanoantenna array and its SERS application,"<p>Cascaded optical field enhancement (CFE) can be realized in some specially designed multiscale plasmonic nanostructures, in which the generation of extremely strong fields at nanoscale volume is crucial for many applications, for example, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In this paper, we propose a strategy for realizing a high-quality plasmonic nanoparticle-in-cavity (PIC) nanoantenna array, in which strong coupling between a nanoparticle (NP) dark mode with a high-order nanocavity bright mode can produce strong Fano resonance at the target wavelength. The Fano resonance can effectively boost the CFE in a PIC. A cost-effective and reliable nanofabrication method is developed using room temperature nanoimprinting lithography to manufacture high-quality PIC arrays. This technique guarantees the generation of only one gold NP at the bottom of each nanocavity, which is crucial for the generation of the expected CFE. To demonstrate the performance and application of the PIC array, the PIC array is employed as an active SERS substrate for detecting 4-aminothiophenol molecules. An experimental SERS enhancement factor of 2 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup> is obtained, which verifies the field enhancement and the potential of this device.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Precision Instrument, State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China', 'authors': ['Zhendong Zhu', ',\xa0Benfeng Bai', '\xa0&\xa0Oubo You']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Tsinghua-Foxconn Nanotechnology Research Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China', 'authors': ['Zhendong Zhu', ',\xa0Qunqing Li', '\xa0&\xa0Shoushan Fan']}]",True,"['Zhendong Zhu', 'Benfeng Bai', 'Oubo You', 'Qunqing Li', 'Shoushan Fan']","Zhu, Z., Bai, B., You, O. et al.

original article,Complete temporal characterization of a single photon,<p>Precise information about the temporal mode of optical states is crucial for optimizing their interaction efficiency between themselves and/or with matter in various quantum communication devices. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a method of determining both the real and imaginary components of a single photon's temporal density matrix by measuring the autocorrelation function of the photocurrent from a balanced homodyne detector at multiple local oscillator frequencies. We test our method on single photons heralded from biphotons generated via four-wave mixing in an atomic vapor and obtain excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for several settings.</p>,,"[{'address': 'Institute for Quantum Science and Technology, University of Calgary, Alberta, T2N1N4, Canada', 'authors': ['Zhongzhong Qin', ',\xa0Adarsh S Prasad', ',\xa0Travis Brannan', '\xa0&\xa0AI Lvovsky']}, {'address': 'Quantum Institute for Light and Atoms, State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200062, China', 'authors': ['Zhongzhong Qin']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Andrew MacRae']}, {'address': 'Institute of Physics, Faculty of Engineering, University of the Republic, J.

original article,A digitally generated ultrafine optical frequency comb for spectral measurements with 0.01-pm resolution and 0.7-µs response time,"<p>Optical spectral measurements are crucial for optical sensors and many other applications, but the prevailing methods, such as optical spectrum analysis and tunable laser spectroscopy, often have to make compromises among resolution, speed, and accuracy. Optical frequency combs are widely used for metrology of discrete atomic and molecular spectral lines. However, they are usually generated by optical methods and have large comb spacing, which limits the resolution for direct sampling of continuous spectra. To overcome these problems, this paper presents an original method to digitally generate an ultrafine optical frequency comb (UFOFC) as the frequency ruler for spectral measurements. Each comb line provides one sampling point, and the full spectrum can be captured at the same time using coherent detection. For an experimental demonstration, we adopted the inverse fast Fourier transform to generate a UFOFC with a comb spacing of 1.46 MHz over a 10-GHz range and demonstrated its functions using a Mach-Zehnder refractive index sensor. The UFOFC obtains a spectral resolution of 0.01 pm and response time of 0.7 &#956;s; both represent 100-fold improvements over the state of the art and could be further enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The UFOFC presented here could facilitate new label-free sensor applications that require both high resolution and fast speed, such as measuring binding kinetics and single-molecule dynamics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Photonics Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China', 'authors': ['Yuan Bao', ',\xa0Zhaohui Li', ',\xa0Qingming Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Jianping Li']}, {'address': 'School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, 610051, China', 'authors': ['Xingwen Yi']}, {'address': 'The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, 518057, China', 'authors': ['Qingming Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Xuming Zhang']}, {'address': 'Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, Michigan, USA', 'authors': ['Xudong Fan']}, {'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, S.A.R., China', 'authors': ['Xuming Zhang']}]",True,"['Yuan Bao', 'Xingwen Yi', 'Zhaohui Li', 'Qingming Chen', 'Jianping Li', 'Xudong Fan', 'Xuming Zhang']","Bao, Y., Yi, X., Li, Z. et al.A digitally generated ultrafine optical frequency comb for spectral measurements with 0. 01-pm resolution and 0.7-µs response time.

original article,An actively ultrafast tunable giant slow-light effect in ultrathin nonlinear metasurfaces,"<p>A slow-light effect based on metamaterial-induced transparency (MIT) possesses great practical applications for integrated photonic devices. However, to date, only very weak slow-light effects have been obtained in metamaterials because of the intrinsic loss of metal. Moreover, no active control of slow-light has been achieved in metamaterials. Here, we report the realization of a giant slow-light effect on an ultrathin metasurface that consists of periodic arrays of gold nanoprism dimers with a thickness of 40 nm sandwiched between a multilayer-graphene micro-sheet/zinc oxide nanoparticle layer and a monolayer graphene/polycrystalline indium tin oxide layer. The strong field confinement of the plasmonic modes associated with the MIT ensures a tremendous reduction in the group velocity around the transparency window. A group index of more than 4 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> is achieved, which is one order of magnitude greater than that of previous reports. A large tunable wavelength range of 120 nm is achieved around the center of the transparency window when the pump light intensity is only 1.5 kW cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. The response time is as fast as 42.3 ps. These results demonstrate the potential for the realization of various functional integrated photonic devices based on metasurfaces, such as all-optical buffers and all-optical switches.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory for Mesoscopic Physics & Department of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China', 'authors': ['Cuicui Lu', ',\xa0Xiaoyong Hu', ',\xa0Kebin Shi', ',\xa0Qin Hu', ',\xa0Rui Zhu', ',\xa0Hong Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Qihuang Gong']}, {'address': 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Beijing, 100871, China', 'authors': ['Xiaoyong Hu', ',\xa0Kebin Shi', ',\xa0Rui Zhu', '\xa0&\xa0Qihuang Gong']}]",True,"['Cuicui Lu', 'Xiaoyong Hu', 'Kebin Shi', 'Qin Hu', 'Rui Zhu', 'Hong Yang', 'Qihuang Gong']","Lu, C., Hu, X., Shi, K. et al.

original article,Fiber guiding at the Dirac frequency beyond photonic bandgaps,"<p>Light trapping within waveguides is a key practice of modern optics, both scientifically and technologically. Photonic crystal fibers traditionally rely on total internal reflection (index-guiding fibers) or a photonic bandgap (photonic-bandgap fibers) to achieve field confinement. Here, we report the discovery of a new light trapping within fibers by the so-called Dirac point of photonic band structures. Our analysis reveals that the Dirac point can establish suppression of radiation losses and consequently a novel guided mode for propagation in photonic crystal fibers. What is known as the Dirac point is a conical singularity of a photonic band structure where wave motion obeys the famous Dirac equation. We find the unexpected phenomenon of wave localization at this point beyond photonic bandgaps. This guiding relies on the Dirac point rather than total internal reflection or photonic bandgaps, thus providing a sort of advancement in conceptual understanding over the traditional fiber guiding. The result presented here demonstrates the discovery of a new type of photonic crystal fibers, with unique characteristics that could lead to new applications in fiber sensors and lasers. The Dirac equation is a special symbol of relativistic quantum mechanics. Because of the similarity between band structures of a solid and a photonic crystal, the discovery of the Dirac-point-induced wave trapping in photonic crystals could provide novel insights into many relativistic quantum effects of the transport phenomena of photons, phonons, and electrons.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Instrument Science and Opto-electronic Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, 230009, Anhui, China', 'authors': ['Kang Xie', ',\xa0Wei Zhang', ',\xa0Haiming Jiang', ',\xa0Zhijia Hu', ',\xa0Qiuping Mao', ',\xa0Lei Hu', ',\xa0Qian Li', ',\xa0Tianyu Yang', ',\xa0Fei Wen', '\xa0&\xa0Erlei Wang']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Salford, Salford, M5 4WT, Manchester, UK', 'authors': ['Allan D Boardman', '\xa0&\xa0Ming Xie']}, {'address': 'Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China', 'authors': ['Zhijia Hu']}, {'address': 'School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610054, Sichuan, China', 'authors': ['Yong Liu']}]",True,"['Kang Xie', 'Wei Zhang', 'Allan D Boardman', 'Haiming Jiang', 'Zhijia Hu', 'Yong Liu', 'Ming Xie', 'Qiuping Mao', 'Lei Hu', 'Qian Li', 'Tianyu Yang', 'Fei Wen', 'Erlei Wang']","Xie, K., Zhang, W., Boardman, A. et al.
