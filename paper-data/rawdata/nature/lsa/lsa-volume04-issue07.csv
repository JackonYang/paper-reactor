original article,Ultrafast photonic PCR,"<p>Nucleic acid amplification and quantification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most sensitive and powerful tools for clinical laboratories, precision medicine, personalized medicine, agricultural science, forensic science and environmental science. Ultrafast multiplex PCR, characterized by low power consumption, compact size and simple operation, is ideal for timely diagnosis at the point-of-care (POC). Although several fast/ultrafast PCR methods have been proposed, the use of a simple and robust PCR thermal cycler remains challenging for POC testing. Here, we present an ultrafast photonic PCR method using plasmonic photothermal light-to-heat conversion via photon&#8211;electron&#8211;phonon coupling. We demonstrate an efficient photonic heat converter using a thin gold (Au) film due to its plasmon-assisted high optical absorption (approximately 65% at 450 nm, the peak wavelength of heat source light-emitting diodes (LEDs)). The plasmon-excited Au film is capable of rapidly heating the surrounding solution to over 150 &#176;C within 3 min. Using this method, ultrafast thermal cycling (30 cycles; heating and cooling rate of 12.79&#177;0.93 &#176;C s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and 6.6&#177;0.29 &#176;C s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, respectively) from 55 &#176;C (temperature of annealing) to 95 &#176;C (temperature of denaturation) is accomplished within 5 min. Using photonic PCR thermal cycles, we demonstrate here successful nucleic acid (&#955;-DNA) amplification. Our simple, robust and low cost approach to ultrafast PCR using an efficient photonic-based heating procedure could be generally integrated into a variety of devices or procedures, including on-chip thermal lysis and heating for isothermal amplifications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Jun Ho Son', ',\xa0Byungrae Cho', ',\xa0SoonGweon Hong', ',\xa0Sang Hun Lee', ',\xa0Ori Hoxha', ',\xa0Amanda J Haack', '\xa0&\xa0Luke P Lee']}, {'address': 'Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Jun Ho Son', ',\xa0Byungrae Cho', ',\xa0SoonGweon Hong', ',\xa0Sang Hun Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Luke P Lee']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Luke P Lee']}, {'address': 'Biophysics Graduate Program, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Luke P Lee']}]",True,"['Jun Ho Son', 'Byungrae Cho', 'SoonGweon Hong', 'Sang Hun Lee', 'Ori Hoxha', 'Amanda J Haack', 'Luke P Lee']","Son, J., Cho, B., Hong, S. et al.

original article,Wavevector Selective Metasurfaces and Tunnel Vision Filters,"<p>Metasurfaces offer unprecedented flexibility in the design and control of light propagation, replacing bulk optical components and exhibiting exotic optical effects. One of the basic properties of the metasurfaces, which renders them as frequency selective surfaces, is the ability to transmit or reflect radiation within a narrow frequency band that can be engineered on demand. Here we introduce and demonstrate experimentally in the THz domain the concept of wavevector selective surfaces &#8211; metasurfaces transparent only within a narrow range of light propagation directions operating effectively as tunnel vision filters. Practical implementations of the new concept include applications in wavefront manipulation, observational instruments, vision and free-space communication in light-scattering environments.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre and Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK', 'authors': ['Vassili A Fedotov', ',\xa0Mauro Perino', ',\xa0Nikitas Papasimakis', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'Department of Molecular and Optical Physics, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, D-79104, Germany', 'authors': ['Jan Wallauer', '\xa0&\xa0Markus Walther']}, {'address': 'Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy', 'authors': ['Mauro Perino']}, {'address': 'Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, TPI, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637371, Singapore', 'authors': ['Nikolay I Zheludev']}]",True,"['Vassili A Fedotov', 'Jan Wallauer', 'Markus Walther', 'Mauro Perino', 'Nikitas Papasimakis', 'Nikolay I Zheludev']","Fedotov, V., Wallauer, J., Walther, M. et al.

original article,Directly patterned substrate-free plasmonic “nanograter” structures with unusual Fano resonances,"<p>The application of three-dimensional (3D) plasmonic nanostructures as metamaterials (MMs), nano-antennas, and other devices faces challenges in producing metallic nanostructures with easily definable orientations, sophisticated shapes, and smooth surfaces that are operational in the optical regime and beyond. Here, we demonstrate that complex 3D nanostructures can be readily achieved with focused-ion-beam irradiation-induced folding and examine the optical characteristics of plasmonic &#8220;nanograter&#8221; structures that are composed of free-standing Au films. These 3D nanostructures exhibit interesting 3D hybridization in current flows and exhibit unusual and well-scalable Fano resonances at wavelengths ranging from 1.6 to 6.4 &#181;m. Upon the introduction of liquids of various refractive indices to the structures, a strong dependence of the Fano resonance is observed, with spectral sensitivities of 1400 nm and 2040 nm per refractive index unit under figures of merit of 35.0 and 12.5, respectively, for low-order and high-order resonance in the near-infrared region. This work indicates the exciting, increasing relevance of similarly constructed 3D free-standing nanostructures in the research and development of photonics and MMs.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China', 'authors': ['Ajuan Cui', ',\xa0Zhe Liu', ',\xa0Jiafang Li', ',\xa0Xiaoxiang Xia', ',\xa0Zhiyuan Li', ',\xa0Benli Wang', ',\xa0Junjie Li', ',\xa0Haifang Yang', ',\xa0Wuxia Li', '\xa0&\xa0Changzhi Gu']}, {'address': 'Joule Physics Laboratory, School of Computing, Science and Engineering, University of Salford, Salford, M5 4WT, UK', 'authors': ['Tiehan H Shen']}, {'address': 'School of Physics Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, China', 'authors': ['Zhijie Gong', '\xa0&\xa0Hongqiang Li']}, {'address': 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Beijing, 200092, China', 'authors': ['Changzhi Gu']}]",True,"['Ajuan Cui', 'Zhe Liu', 'Jiafang Li', 'Tiehan H Shen', 'Xiaoxiang Xia', 'Zhiyuan Li', 'Zhijie Gong', 'Hongqiang Li', 'Benli Wang', 'Junjie Li', 'Haifang Yang', 'Wuxia Li', 'Changzhi Gu']","Cui, A., Liu, Z., Li, J. et al.

original article,Optical tuning of exciton and trion emissions in monolayer phosphorene,"<p>Monolayer phosphorene provides a unique two-dimensional (2D) platform to investigate the fundamental dynamics of excitons and trions (charged excitons) in reduced dimensions. However, owing to its high instability, unambiguous identification of monolayer phosphorene has been elusive. Consequently, many important fundamental properties, such as exciton dynamics, remain underexplored. We report a rapid, noninvasive, and highly accurate approach based on optical interferometry to determine the layer number of phosphorene, and confirm the results with reliable photoluminescence measurements. Furthermore, we successfully probed the dynamics of excitons and trions in monolayer phosphorene by controlling the photo-carrier injection in a relatively low excitation power range. Based on our measured optical gap and the previously measured electronic energy gap, we determined the exciton binding energy to be &#8764;0.3 eV for the monolayer phosphorene on SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si substrate, which agrees well with theoretical predictions. A huge trion binding energy of &#8764;100 meV was first observed in monolayer phosphorene, which is around five times higher than that in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer semiconductor, such as MoS<sub>2</sub>. The carrier lifetime of exciton emission in monolayer phosphorene was measured to be &#8764;220 ps, which is comparable to those in other 2D TMD semiconductors. Our results open new avenues for exploring fundamental phenomena and novel optoelectronic applications using monolayer phosphorene.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research School of Engineering, College of Engineering and Computer Science, The Australian National University, Canberra, 0200, ACT, Australia', 'authors': ['Jiong Yang', ',\xa0Renjing Xu', ',\xa0Jiajie Pei', ',\xa0Ye Win Myint', ',\xa0Shuang Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Yuerui Lu']}, {'address': 'School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China', 'authors': ['Jiajie Pei']}, {'address': 'Department of Electronic Materials Engineering, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, 0200, ACT, Australia', 'authors': ['Fan Wang']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, 53706, WI, USA', 'authors': ['Zhu Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Zongfu Yu']}]",True,"['Jiong Yang', 'Renjing Xu', 'Jiajie Pei', 'Ye Win Myint', 'Fan Wang', 'Zhu Wang', 'Shuang Zhang', 'Zongfu Yu', 'Yuerui Lu']","Yang, J., Xu, R., Pei, J. et al.

original article,Photoswitchable molecular dipole antennas with tailored coherent coupling in glassy composite,"<p>Here, we introduce the first experimental proof of coherent oscillation and coupling of photoswitchable molecules embedded randomly in a polymeric matrix and acting cooperatively upon illumination with UV light. In particular, we demonstrate the specular reflection and Brewster phenomenon alteration of photochromic molecular dipole antennas. We successfully demonstrate the concept of Brewster wavelength, which is based on the dipolar interaction between radiating dipoles and the surrounding matrix possessing a net dipole moment, as a key tool for highly localized sensing of matrix polarity. We also introduce the concept of &#8216;tailored molecular photonic coupling&#8217; while highlighting the role of interferences for the design of optically active media by adjusting the photonic response of the medium with the real and imaginary refractive index of photoswitchable molecules in the &#8216;ON&#8217; state. Our results enhance our fundamental understanding of coherent dipole radiation and open a new vein of research based on glassy disordered dipolar composites that act as macroscopic antenna with cooperative action; furthermore, these results have important implications for new design rules of tailored photonics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nanochemistry and Nanoengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Institute for Materials Science, University of Kiel, Kaiserstrasse 2, Kiel, 24143, Germany', 'authors': ['Mady Elbahri', ',\xa0Ahnaf Usman Zillohu', ',\xa0Bastian Gothe', ',\xa0Mehdi Keshavarz Hedayati', ',\xa0Ramzy Abdelaziz', '\xa0&\xa0Moheb Abdelaziz']}, {'address': 'Nanochemistry and Nanoengineering, Institute of Polymer Research, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Max-Planck-Strasse 1, Geesthacht, 21502, Germany', 'authors': ['Mady Elbahri', '\xa0&\xa0Shahin Homaeigohar']}, {'address': 'Ceramics and Building Materials Department, Refractories, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt', 'authors': ['Ramzy Abdelaziz']}, {'address': 'Electrical Engineering Department, Islamic University of Gaza, Gaza, PO Box 108, Palestine', 'authors': ['Hala Jarallah El-Khozondar']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, The Hashemite University, Zarqa, Jordan & Khalifa University of Science, Technology & Research (KUSTAR), PO Box 573, Sharjah, UAE', 'authors': ['Muhammad Bawa’aneh']}, {'address': 'DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Oersteds pl. 343, Kongens, Lyngby, DK-2800, Denmark', 'authors': ['Andrei Lavrinenko', '\xa0&\xa0Sergei Zhukovsky']}]",True,"['Mady Elbahri', 'Ahnaf Usman Zillohu', 'Bastian Gothe', 'Mehdi Keshavarz Hedayati', 'Ramzy Abdelaziz', 'Hala Jarallah El-Khozondar', 'Muhammad Bawa’aneh', 'Moheb Abdelaziz', 'Andrei Lavrinenko', 'Sergei Zhukovsky', 'Shahin Homaeigohar']","Elbahri, M., Zillohu, A., Gothe, B. et al.

review,Recent advances in ultrafast semiconductor disk lasers,"<p>The performance of ultrafast semiconductor disk lasers has rapidly advanced in recent decades. The strong interest from industry for inexpensive, compact, and reliable ultrafast laser sources in the picosecond and femtosecond domains has driven this technology toward commercial products. Frequency metrology and biomedical applications would benefit from sub-200-femtosecond pulse durations with peak powers in the kilowatt range. The aim of this review is to briefly describe the market potential and give an overview of the current status of mode-locked semiconductor disk lasers.
