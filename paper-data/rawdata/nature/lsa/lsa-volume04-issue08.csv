original article,Stable optical vortices in nonlinear multicore fibers,"<p>The multicore fiber (MCF) is a physical system of high practical importance. In addition to standard exploitation, MCFs may support discrete vortices that carry orbital angular momentum suitable for spatial-division multiplexing in high-capacity fiber-optic communication systems. These discrete vortices may also be attractive for high-power laser applications. We present the conditions of existence, stability, and coherent propagation of such optical vortices for two practical MCF designs. Through optimization, we found stable discrete vortices that were capable of transferring high coherent power through the MCF.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Vinča Institute of Nuclear Sciences, University of Belgrade, P.O.

original article,Optical visualization and polarized light absorption of the single-wall carbon nanotube to verify intrinsic thermal applications,"<p>The predicted extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from theoretical calculations have great potential for many applications. However, reliable experimental determination of intrinsic properties at the single-tube level is currently a matter of concern, and many challenges remain because of the unhandled and nanoscale size of individual nanotubes. Here, we demonstrated a prototype to detect the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and verify the significant non-resonant optical absorption behavior on tiny nanotubes by integrating the nanotube and ice into a new core-shell design. In particular, a reversible optical visualization method based on the individual suspended ultra-long SWCNT was first developed by wrapping a nanotube with ice in the cryogenic air environment. The light-induced thermal effect on the hybrid core-shell structure was used to melt the ice shell, which subsequently acted as a temperature sensor to verify the intrinsic thermal conductivity of the core-like nanotube. More interestingly, we successfully determined for the first time the thermal response phenomenon of the tiny absorption cross section in SWCNT in the vertical-polarization configuration and the significant non-resonant absorption behavior in the parallel-polarization configuration. These investigations will provide a better understanding for the unique optical behaviors of CNT and enable the detection of intrinsic properties of various one-dimensional nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanowires, and nanoribbons.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China', 'authors': ['Xiao Zhang', ',\xa0Le Cai', ',\xa0Xuezeng Tian', ',\xa0Qiang Zhang', ',\xa0Wenbin Zhou', ',\xa0Nan Zhang', ',\xa0Feng Yang', ',\xa0Qingxia Fan', ',\xa0Yanchun Wang', ',\xa0Huaping Liu', ',\xa0Xuedong Bai', ',\xa0Weiya Zhou', '\xa0&\xa0Sishen Xie']}, {'address': 'National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230029, China', 'authors': ['Li Song']}, {'address': 'National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, 100190, China', 'authors': ['Xiaoying Qi']}]",True,"['Xiao Zhang', 'Li Song', 'Le Cai', 'Xuezeng Tian', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Xiaoying Qi', 'Wenbin Zhou', 'Nan Zhang', 'Feng Yang', 'Qingxia Fan', 'Yanchun Wang', 'Huaping Liu', 'Xuedong Bai', 'Weiya Zhou', 'Sishen Xie']","Zhang, X., Song, L., Cai, L. et al.

original article,Exploring new avenues in high repetition rate table-top coherent extreme ultraviolet sources,"<p>The process of high harmonic generation (HHG) enables the development of table-top sources of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light. Although these are now matured sources, they still mostly rely on bulk laser technology that limits the attainable repetition rate to the low kilohertz regime. Moreover, many of the emerging applications of such light sources (e.g., photoelectron spectroscopy and microscopy, coherent diffractive imaging, or frequency metrology in the XUV spectral region) require an increase in the repetition rate. Ideally, these sources are operated with a multi-MHz repetition rate and deliver a high photon flux simultaneously. So far, this regime has been solely addressed using passive enhancement cavities together with low energy and high repetition rate lasers. Here, a novel route with significantly reduced complexity (omitting the requirement of an external actively stabilized resonator) is demonstrated that achieves the previously mentioned demanding parameters. A krypton-filled Kagome photonic crystal fiber is used for efficient nonlinear compression of 9 &#181;J, 250 fs pulses leading to &#8764;7 &#181;J, 31 fs pulses at 10.7 MHz repetition rate. The compressed pulses are used for HHG in a gas jet. Particular attention is devoted to achieving phase-matched (transiently) generation yielding &gt;10<sup>13</sup>&#160;photons&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (&gt;50&#160;&#181;W) at 27.7&#160;eV. This new spatially coherent XUV source improved the photon flux by four orders of magnitude for direct multi-MHZ experiments, thus demonstrating the considerable potential of this source.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Institute of Applied Physics, Abbe Center of Photonics, Albert-Einstein-Straße 15, Jena, 07745, Germany', 'authors': ['Steffen Hädrich', ',\xa0Manuel Krebs', ',\xa0Armin Hoffmann', ',\xa0Arno Klenke', ',\xa0Jan Rothhardt', ',\xa0Jens Limpert', '\xa0&\xa0Andreas Tünnermann']}, {'address': 'Helmholtz-Institute Jena, Fröbelstieg 3, Jena, 07743, Germany', 'authors': ['Steffen Hädrich', ',\xa0Arno Klenke', ',\xa0Jan Rothhardt', ',\xa0Jens Limpert', '\xa0&\xa0Andreas Tünnermann']}, {'address': 'Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Albert-Einstein-Straße 7, Jena, 07745, Germany', 'authors': ['Andreas Tünnermann']}]",True,"['Steffen Hädrich', 'Manuel Krebs', 'Armin Hoffmann', 'Arno Klenke', 'Jan Rothhardt', 'Jens Limpert', 'Andreas Tünnermann']","Hädrich, S., Krebs, M., Hoffmann, A. et al.

original article,Prediction of photothermal phase signatures from arbitrary plasmonic nanoparticles and experimental verification,"<p>We present a new approach for predicting spatial phase signals originating from photothermally excited metallic nanoparticles of arbitrary shapes and sizes. The heat emitted from such a nanoparticle affects the measured optical phase signal via changes in both the refractive index and thickness of the nanoparticle surroundings. Because these particles can be bio-functionalized to bind certain biological cell components, they can be used for biomedical imaging with molecular specificity, as new nanoscopy labels, and for photothermal therapy. Predicting the ideal nanoparticle parameters requires a model that computes the thermal and phase distributions around the particle, thereby enabling more efficient phase imaging of plasmonic nanoparticles and avoiding trial-and-error experiments while using unsuitable nanoparticles. The proposed nonlinear model is the first to enable the prediction of phase signatures from nanoparticles with arbitrary parameters. The model is based on a finite-volume method for geometry discretization and an implicit backward Euler method for solving the transient inhomogeneous heat equation, followed by calculation of the accumulative phase signal. To validate the model, we compared its results with experimental results obtained for gold nanorods of various concentrations, which we acquired using a custom-built wide-field interferometric phase microscopy system.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel', 'authors': ['Omry Blum', '\xa0&\xa0Natan T Shaked']}]",True,"['Omry Blum', 'Natan T Shaked']","Blum, O., Shaked, N.
