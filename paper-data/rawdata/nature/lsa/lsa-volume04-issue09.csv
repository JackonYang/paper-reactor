original article,Broadband diffusion of terahertz waves by multi-bit coding metasurfaces,"<p>The terahertz region is a special region of the electromagnetic spectrum that incorporates the advantages of both microwaves and infrared light waves. In the past decade, metamaterials with effective medium parameters or gradient phases have been studied to control terahertz waves and realize functional devices. Here, we present a new approach to manipulate terahertz waves by using coding metasurfaces that are composed of digital coding elements. We propose a general coding unit based on a Minkowski closed-loop particle that is capable of generating 1-bit coding (with two phase states of 0 and 180&#176;), 2-bit coding (with four phase states of 0, 90&#176;, 180&#176;, and 270&#176;), and multi-bit coding elements in the terahertz frequencies by using different geometric scales. We show that multi-bit coding metasurfaces have strong abilities to control terahertz waves by designing-specific coding sequences. As an application, we demonstrate a new scattering strategy of terahertz waves&#8212;broadband and wide-angle diffusion&#8212;using a 2-bit coding metasurface with a special coding design and verify it by both numerical simulations and experiments. The presented method opens a new route to reducing the scattering of terahertz waves.</p>",[],True,"[""Li-Hua Gao"", ""Qiang Cheng"", ""Jing Yang"", ""Shao-Jie Ma"", ""Jie Zhao"", ""Shuo Liu"", ""Hai-Bing Chen"", ""Qiong He"", ""Wei-Xiang Jiang"", ""Hui-Feng Ma"", ""Qi-Ye Wen"", ""Lan-Ju Liang"", ""Biao-Bing Jin"", ""Wei-Wei Liu"", ""Lei Zhou"", ""Jian-Quan Yao"", ""Pei-Heng Wu"", ""Tie-Jun Cui""]","Gao, LH., Cheng, Q., Yang, J. et al.

original article,Ultra-subwavelength phase-sensitive Fano-imaging of localized photonic modes,"<p>Photonic and plasmonic devices rely on nanoscale control of the local density of optical states (LDOS) in dielectric and metallic environments. The tremendous progress in designing and tailoring the electric LDOS of nano-resonators requires an investigation tool that is able to access the detailed features of the optical localized resonant modes with deep-subwavelength spatial resolution. This scenario has motivated the development of different nanoscale imaging techniques. Here, we prove that a technique involving the combination of scanning near-field optical microscopy with resonant scattering spectroscopy enables imaging the electric LDOS in nano-resonators with outstanding spatial resolution (&#955;/19) by means of a pure optical method based on light scattering. Using this technique, we investigate the properties of photonic crystal nanocavities, demonstrating that the resonant modes appear as characteristic Fano line shapes, which arise from interference. Therefore, by monitoring the spatial variation of the Fano line shape, we locally measure the phase modulation of the resonant modes without the need of external heterodyne detection. This novel, deep-subwavelength imaging method allows us to access both the intensity and the phase modulation of localized electric fields. Finally, this technique could be implemented on any type of platform, being particularly appealing for those based on non-optically active material, such as silicon, glass, polymers, or metals.</p>",[],True,"[""Niccol\u00f2 Caselli"", ""Francesca Intonti"", ""Federico La China"", ""Francesco Riboli"", ""Annamaria Gerardino"", ""Wei Bao"", ""Alexander Weber Bargioni"", ""Lianhe Li"", ""Edmund H Linfield"", ""Francesco Pagliano"", ""Andrea Fiore"", ""Massimo Gurioli""]","Caselli, N., Intonti, F., La China, F. et al.

original article,Chiral surface waves supported by biaxial hyperbolic metamaterials,"<p>We discover a new kind of surface wave on biaxial hyperbolic metamaterial, which, in the k-space, connects the two diabolical points (or conical singularities) of the equifrequency surface. Interestingly, the propagation of such surface wave is found to be sensitive to the refractive index of the surrounding dielectric medium, showing a convex, concave or flat phase front when the refractive index is varied. Furthermore, the surface wave shows an elliptically polarized state, in which helicity is dependent on the propagation direction. This feature can be utilized for the spin-controllable excitation of surface waves, opening a gateway towards integrated photonic circuits with reconfigurable functionalities.</p>",[],True,"[""Wen-Long Gao"", ""Feng-Zhou Fang"", ""Yong-Min Liu"", ""Shuang Zhang""]","Gao, WL., Fang, FZ., Liu, YM. et al.

original article,Plasmonic polarization generator in well-routed beaming,"<p>As one of the recent advances of optics and photonics, plasmonics has enabled unprecedented optical designs. Having a vectorial configuration of surface plasmon field, metallic nanostructures offer efficient solutions in polarization control with a very limited sample thickness. Many compact polarization devices have been realized using such metallic nanostructures. However, in most of these devices, the functions were usually simple and limited to a few polarization states. Here, we demonstrated a plasmonic polarization generator that can reconfigure an input polarization to all types of polarization states simultaneously. The plasmonic polarization generator is based on the interference of the in-plane (longitudinal) field of the surface plasmons that gives rise to versatile near-field polarization states on a metal surface, which have seldom been considered in previous studies. With a well-designed nanohole array, the in-plane field of SPPs with proper polarization states and phases can be selectively scattered out to the desired light beams. A manifestation of eight focusing beams with well-routed polarizations was experimentally demonstrated. Our design offers a new route to achieve the full control of optical polarizations and possibly advance the development in photonic information processing.</p>",[],True,"[""Lin Li"", ""Tao Li"", ""Xia-Mei Tang"", ""Shu-Ming Wang"", ""Qian-Jin Wang"", ""Shi-Ning Zhu""]","Li, L., Li, T., Tang, XM. et al.

original article,Advantages of white LED lamps and new detector technology in photometry,"<p>Light emitting diode (LED) lighting is becoming more and more popular, as incandescent lamps are being phased out globally. LEDs have several advantages over incandescent lamps, including energy efficiency, robustness, long lifetime, and good temporal stability. The three latter features make LEDs attractive candidates as new photometric standards. Because the spectra of white LEDs are limited to the visible wavelength range, a novel method for the realization of photometric units based on the predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED) can be utilized. The method eliminates the need of photometric filters that are traditionally used in photometry, and instead relies on carrying out the photometric weighting numerically based on the measured relative spectrum of the source. The PQED-based realization simplifies the traceability chain of photometric measurements significantly as compared with the traditional filter-based method. The measured illuminance values of a white LED deviate by only 0.03% when determined by the new and the traditional methods. The new PQED method has significantly lower expanded uncertainty of 0.26% (k = 2) as compared with that of the traditional filter-based method of 0.42% (k = 2). Furthermore, when filtered photometers that measure LED lighting are calibrated using LED lamps as calibration sources instead of incandescent lamps, a significant decrease in the uncertainty related to the spectral mismatch correction can be obtained. The maximum spectral mismatch errors of LED measurements decreased on average by a factor of 3 when switching from an incandescent lamp to an LED calibration source.</p>",[],True,"[""Tomi Pulli"", ""Timo D\u00f6nsberg"", ""Tuomas Poikonen"", ""Farshid Manoocheri"", ""Petri K\u00e4rh\u00e4"", ""Erkki Ikonen""]","Pulli, T., DÃ¶nsberg, T., Poikonen, T. et al.

original article,Visible light optical coherence tomography measures retinal oxygen metabolic response to systemic oxygenation,"<p>The lack of capability to quantify oxygen metabolism noninvasively impedes both fundamental investigation and clinical diagnosis of a wide spectrum of diseases including all the major blinding diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. Using visible light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT), we demonstrated accurate and robust measurement of retinal oxygen metabolic rate (rMRO<sub>2</sub>) noninvasively in rat eyes. We continuously monitored the regulatory response of oxygen consumption to a progressive hypoxic challenge. We found that both oxygen delivery, and rMRO<sub>2</sub> increased from the highly regulated retinal circulation (RC) under hypoxia, by 0.28 &#177; 0.08 &#181;L min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (p &lt; 0.001), and 0.20 &#177; 0.04 &#181;L min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (p &lt; 0.001) per 100 mmHg systemic pO<sub>2</sub> reduction, respectively. The increased oxygen extraction compensated for the deficient oxygen supply from the poorly regulated choroidal circulation. Results from an oxygen diffusion model based on previous oxygen electrode measurements corroborated our in vivo observations. We believe that vis-OCT has the potential to reveal the fundamental role of oxygen metabolism in various retinal diseases.</p>",[],True,"[""Ji Yi"", ""Wenzhong Liu"", ""Siyu Chen"", ""Vadim Backman"", ""Nader Sheibani"", ""Christine M.
