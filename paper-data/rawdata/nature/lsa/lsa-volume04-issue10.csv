original article,Bright trions in direct-bandgap silicon nanocrystals revealed by low-temperature single-nanocrystal spectroscopy,"<p>Strain-engineered silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have recently been shown to possess direct bandgap. Here, we report the observation of a rich structure in the single-nanocrystal photoluminescence spectra of strain-engineered direct-bandgap SiNCs in the temperature range of 9&#8211;300 K. The relationship between individual types of spectra is discussed, and the numerical modeling of spectral diffusion of the experimentally acquired spectra reveals a common origin for most types. The intrinsic spectral shape is shown to be a structure that contains three peaks, approximately 150 meV apart, each of which possesses a Si phonon substructure. Narrow spectral lines, reaching &#8804;1 meV at 20 K, are detected. The observed temperature dependence of the spectral structure can be assigned to the radiative recombination of positively charged trions, in contrast to several previous reports linking a very similar shape to phonons in the surface capping layers. Our result serves as strong additional support for the direct-bandgap nature of the investigated SiNCs.</p>",[],True,"[""Kate\u0159ina K\u016fsov\u00e1"", ""Ivan Pelant"", ""Jan Valenta""]","Kůsová, K., Pelant, I. & Valenta, J.

original article,Superconducting single-photon detectors integrated with diamond nanophotonic circuits,"<p>Photonic quantum technologies hold promise to repeat the success of integrated nanophotonic circuits in non-classical applications. Using linear optical elements, quantum optical computations can be performed with integrated optical circuits and can therefore overcome the existing limitations in terms of scalability. In addition to passive optical devices for realizing photonic quantum gates, active elements, such as single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, are essential ingredients for future optical quantum circuits. Material systems that allow for the monolithic integration of all components are particularly attractive, including III-V semiconductors, silicon and diamond. Here, we demonstrate nanophotonic integrated circuits made from high-quality polycrystalline diamond thin films in combination with on-chip single-photon detectors. By using superconducting nanowires that are coupled evanescently to traveling waves, we achieve high detection efficiencies of up to 66% as well as low dark count rates and a timing resolution of 190 ps. Our devices are fully scalable and hold promise for functional diamond photonic quantum devices.</p>",[],True,"[""Patrik Rath"", ""Oliver Kahl"", ""Simone Ferrari"", ""Fabian Sproll"", ""Georgia Lewes-Malandrakis"", ""Dietmar Brink"", ""Konstantin Ilin"", ""Michael Siegel"", ""Christoph Nebel"", ""Wolfram Pernice""]","Rath, P., Kahl, O., Ferrari, S. et al.

original article,Isolator-free unidirectional thulium-doped fiber laser,"<p>We report the first demonstration of a unidirectional, isolator-free 2-&#956;m thulium-doped fiber (TDF) laser, relying on the properties of the theta cavity (ring resonator with S-shaped feedback). The core pumped theta cavity TDF laser provides sub-Watt output power with a slope efficiency of 25%, a 2 dB flat tuning range of 1900&#8211;2050 nm, and a linewidth of 0.2 nm, and achieves the extinction ratio of 18&#8211;25 dB (depending on the feedback value) between the favored and suppressed lasing directions. It is shown that these characteristics are competitive with, if not superior to, those of conventional ring cavities. The simulation results of the linear and Kerr-nonlinear theta cavities are also presented, explaining certain unexpected features of the laser behavior and establishing the importance of the doped fiber nonlinearity on the spectral shaping of the emitted signal.</p>",[],True,"[""Svyatoslav Kharitonov"", ""Camille-Sophie Br\u00e8s""]","Kharitonov, S., Brès, CS.

original article,Plasmon-driven reaction controlled by the number of graphene layers and localized surface plasmon distribution during optical excitation,"<p>Graphene-plasmonic hybrid platforms have attracted an enormous amount of interest in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS); however, the mechanism of employing graphene is still ambiguous, so clarification about the complex interaction among molecules, graphene, and plasmon processes is urgently needed. We report that the number of graphene layers controlled the plasmon-driven, surface-catalyzed reaction that converts para-aminothiophenol (PATP)-to-p,p&#8242;-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) on chemically inert, graphene-coated, silver bowtie nanoantenna arrays. The catalytic reaction was monitored by SERS, which revealed that the catalytic reaction occurred on the chemical inertness monolayer graphene (1G)-coated silver nanostructures. The introduction of 1G enhances the plasmon-driven surface-catalyzed reaction of the conversion of PATP-to-p,p&#8242;-DMAB. The chemical reaction is suppressed by bilayer graphene. In the process of the catalytic reaction, the electron transfer from the PATP molecule to 1G-coated silver nanostructures. Subsequently, the transferred electrons on the graphene recombine with the hot-hole produced by the localized surface plasmon resonance of silver nanostructures. Then, a couple of PATP molecules lost electrons are catalyzed into the p,p&#8242;-DMAB molecule on the graphene surface. The experimental results were further supported by the finite-difference time-domain method and quantum chemical calculations.</p>",[],True,"[""Zhi-gao Dai"", ""Xiang-heng Xiao"", ""Wei Wu"", ""Yu-peng Zhang"", ""Lei Liao"", ""Shi-shang Guo"", ""Jian-jian Ying"", ""Chong-xin Shan"", ""Meng-tao Sun"", ""Chang-zhong Jiang""]","Dai, Zg., Xiao, Xh., Wu, W. et al.

original article,Multi-photon quantum cutting in Gd2O2S:Tm3+ to enhance the photo-response of solar cells,"<p>Conventional photoluminescence (PL) yields at most one emitted photon for each absorption event. Downconversion (or quantum cutting) materials can yield more than one photon by virtue of energy transfer processes between luminescent centers. In this work, we introduce Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Tm<sup>3+</sup> as a multi-photon quantum cutter. It can convert near-infrared, visible, or ultraviolet photons into two, three, or four infrared photons of &#8764;1800 nm, respectively. The cross-relaxation steps between Tm<sup>3+</sup> ions that lead to quantum cutting are identified from (time-resolved) PL as a function of the Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration in the crystal. A model is presented that reproduces the way in which the Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration affects both the relative intensities of the various emission lines and the excited state dynamics and providing insight in the quantum cutting efficiency. Finally, we discuss the potential application of Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Tm<sup>3+</sup> for spectral conversion to improve the efficiency of next-generation photovoltaics.</p>",[],True,"[""De-Chao Yu"", ""Rosa Mart\u00edn-Rodr\u00edguez"", ""Qin-Yuan Zhang"", ""Andries Meijerink"", ""Freddy T Rabouw""]","Yu, DC., Martín-Rodríguez, R., Zhang, QY. et al.

original article,Portable lensless wide-field microscopy imaging platform based on digital inline holography and multi-frame pixel super-resolution,"<p>In this paper, an irregular displacement-based lensless wide-field microscopy imaging platform is presented by combining digital in-line holography and computational pixel super-resolution using multi-frame processing. The samples are illuminated by a nearly coherent illumination system, where the hologram shadows are projected into a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor-based imaging sensor. To increase the resolution, a multi-frame pixel resolution approach is employed to produce a single holographic image from multiple frame observations of the scene, with small planar displacements. Displacements are resolved by a hybrid approach: (i) alignment of the LR images by a fast feature-based registration method, and (ii) fine adjustment of the sub-pixel information using a continuous optimization approach designed to find the global optimum solution. Numerical method for phase-retrieval is applied to decode the signal and reconstruct the morphological details of the analyzed sample. The presented approach was evaluated with various biological samples including sperm and platelets, whose dimensions are in the order of a few microns. The obtained results demonstrate a spatial resolution of 1.55 &#956;m on a field-of-view of &#8776;30 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>",[],True,"[""Antonio C Sobieranski"", ""Fatih Inci"", ""H Cumhur Tekin"", ""Mehmet Yuksekkaya"", ""Eros Comunello"", ""Daniel Cobra"", ""Aldo von Wangenheim"", ""Utkan Demirci""]","Sobieranski, A., Inci, F., Tekin, H. et al.
