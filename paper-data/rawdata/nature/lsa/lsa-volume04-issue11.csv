original article,Graphene-doped polymer nanofibers for low-threshold nonlinear optical waveguiding,"<p>Graphene-doped polymer nanofibers are fabricated by taper drawing of solvated polyvinyl alcohol doped with liquid-phase exfoliated graphene flakes. Nanofibers drawn this way typically have diameters measured in hundreds of nanometers and lengths in tens of millimeters; they show excellent uniformity and surface smoothness for optical waveguiding. Owing to their tightly confined waveguiding behavior, light&#8211;matter interaction in these subwavelength-diameter nanofibers is significantly enhanced. Using approximately 1350-nm-wavelength femto-second pulses, we demonstrate saturable absorption behavior in these nanofibers with a saturation threshold down to 0.25 pJ pulse<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (peak power &#8764;1.3 W). Additionally, using 1064-nm-wavelength nanosecond pulses as switching light, we show all-optical modulation of a 1550-nm-wavelength signal light guided along a single nanofiber with a switching peak power of &#8764;3.2 W.</p>",[],True,"[""Chao Meng"", ""Shao-Liang Yu"", ""Hong-Qing Wang"", ""Yue Cao"", ""Li-Min Tong"", ""Wei-Tao Liu"", ""Yuen-Ron Shen""]","Meng, C., Yu, SL., Wang, HQ. et al.

original article,Polarization shaping of Poincaré beams by polariton oscillations,"<p>We propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally the generation of light pulses whose polarization varies temporally to cover selected areas of the Poincar&#233; sphere with both tunable swirling speed and total duration (1 ps and 10 ps, respectively, in our implementation). The effect relies on the Rabi oscillations of two polariton polarized fields excited by two counter-polarized and delayed pulses. The superposition of the oscillating fields result in the precession of the Stokes vector of the emitted light while polariton lifetime imbalance results in its drift from a circle of controllable radius on the Poincar&#233; sphere to a single point at long times. The positioning of the initial circle and final point allows to engineer the type of polarization spanning, including a full sweeping of the Poincar&#233; sphere. The universality and simplicity of the scheme should allow for the deployment of time-varying full-Poincar&#233; polarization fields in a variety of platforms, timescales, and regimes.</p>",[],True,"[""David Colas"", ""Lorenzo Dominici"", ""Stefano Donati"", ""Anastasiia A Pervishko"", ""Timothy CH Liew"", ""Ivan A Shelykh"", ""Dario Ballarini"", ""Milena de Giorgi"", ""Alberto Bramati"", ""Giuseppe Gigli"", ""Elena del Valle"", ""Fabrice P Laussy"", ""Alexey V Kavokin"", ""Daniele Sanvitto""]","Colas, D., Dominici, L., Donati, S. et al.

original article,Optical delivery of multiple opsin-encoding genes leads to targeted expression and white-light activation,"<p>In photodegenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), progressive loss of vision occurs as a result of degeneration of the periphery of the retina and the macula, respectively. Current optogenetic stimulation-based approaches to vision restoration offer the advantages of cellular specificity, high resolution, and minimal invasiveness over electrode arrays; however, the clinical translation of optogenetic activation suffers from the lack of a method for the delivery of opsins into spatially targeted regions of a retina that has degenerated. Non-targeted opsin delivery through viral or non-viral methods to non-photodegenerated retinal areas will perturb these already functioning retinal regions. Furthermore, viral methods are subject to limitations on the delivery of large plasmids, such as fusion constructs of multiple spectrally separated opsins (e.g., channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), chimeric opsin variants (C1V1), ReaChR), which can provide higher photo-excitability than can a single narrow-band opsin under ambient light conditions. Here, we report the ultrafast near-infrared laser-based spatially targeted transfection of single and multiple opsins and present a comparison with the opsin expression distribution achieved using another non-viral, but non-targeted, transfection method, lipofection. Functional evaluation of cells transfected with multiple opsins using the laser method revealed a significantly higher white-light-induced photocurrent than in cells expressing a single opsin (ChR2). The laser-assisted targeted delivery of multiple opsin-encoding genes to the peripheral retina/macula is ideal for sensitizing retinal areas that have degenerated, thus paving the way toward the restoration of lost vision in RP/AMD patients.</p>",[],True,"[""Kamal Dhakal"", ""Subrata Batabyal"", ""Weldon Wright"", ""Young-tae Kim"", ""Samarendra Mohanty""]","Dhakal, K., Batabyal, S., Wright, W. et al.

original article,Thermally reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits at telecom wavelength by femtosecond laser micromachining,"<p>The importance of integrated quantum photonics in the telecom band is based on the possibility of interfacing with the optical network infrastructure that was developed for classical communications. In this framework, femtosecond laser-written integrated photonic circuits, which have already been assessed for use in quantum information experiments in the 800-nm wavelength range, have great potential. In fact, these circuits, being written in glass, can be perfectly mode-matched at telecom wavelength to the in/out coupling fibers, which is a key requirement for a low-loss processing node in future quantum optical networks. In addition, for several applications, quantum photonic devices must be dynamically reconfigurable. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the high performance of femtosecond laser-written photonic circuits for use in quantum experiments in the telecom band, and we demonstrate the use of thermal shifters, which were also fabricated using the same femtosecond laser, to accurately tune such circuits. State-of-the-art manipulation of single- and two-photon states is demonstrated, with fringe visibilities greater than 95%. The results of this work open the way to the realization of reconfigurable quantum photonic circuits based on this technological platform.</p>",[],True,"[""Fulvio Flamini"", ""Lorenzo Magrini"", ""Adil S Rab"", ""Nicol\u00f2 Spagnolo"", ""Vincenzo D'Ambrosio"", ""Paolo Mataloni"", ""Fabio Sciarrino"", ""Tommaso Zandrini"", ""Andrea Crespi"", ""Roberta Ramponi"", ""Roberto Osellame""]","Flamini, F., Magrini, L., Rab, A. et al.

original article,Mechanism of mechanical quenching and mechanoluminescence in phosphorescent CaZnOS:Cu,"<p>This article reports a new phosphorescent material, CaZnOS:Cu, that exhibits two types of mechano-optical conversion: mechanical quenching and mechanoluminescence. An intense mechanical quenching of phosphorescence corresponding to mechanical stimuli can be achieved in CaZnOS:Cu within a short decay time period. Over time, it gradually changes to mechanoluminescence when a mechanical load is applied. We propose that the mechanical quenching and mechanoluminescence arise from the different roles of shallow and deep traps in CaZnOS:Cu. CaZnOS:Cu has promising applications in monitoring mechanical stress in industrial plants, structures, and living bodies.</p>",[],True,"[""Dong Tu"", ""Chao-Nan Xu"", ""Yuki Fujio"", ""Akihito Yoshida""]","Tu, D., Xu, CN., Fujio, Y. et al.

review,On-chip light sources for silicon photonics,"<p>Serving as the electrical to optical converter, the on-chip silicon light source is an indispensable component of silicon photonic technologies and has long been pursued. Here, we briefly review the history and recent progress of a few promising contenders for on-chip light sources in terms of operating wavelength, pump condition, power consumption, and fabrication process. Additionally, the performance of each contender is also assessed with respect to thermal stability, which is a crucial parameter to consider in complex optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs) and optical interconnections. Currently, III-V-based silicon (Si) lasers formed via bonding techniques demonstrate the best performance and display the best opportunity for commercial usage in the near future. However, in the long term, direct hetero-epitaxial growth of III&#8211;V materials on Si seems more promising for low-cost, high-yield fabrication. The demonstration of high-performance quantum dot (QD) lasers monolithically grown on Si strongly forecasts its feasibility and enormous potential for on-chip lasers. The superior temperature-insensitive characteristics of the QD laser promote this design in large-scale high-density OEICs. The Germanium (Ge)-on-Si laser is also competitive for large-scale monolithic integration in the future. Compared with a III-V-based Si laser, the biggest potential advantage of a Ge-on-Si laser lies in its material and processing compatibility with Si technology. Additionally, the versatility of Ge facilitates photon emission, modulation, and detection simultaneously with a simple process complexity and low cost.</p>",[],True,"[""Zhiping Zhou"", ""Bing Yin"", ""Jurgen Michel""]","Zhou, Z., Yin, B. & Michel, J.
