original article,An all-optical modulator based on a stereo graphene–microfiber structure,"<p>An in-line, all-optical fiber modulator based on a stereo graphene&#8211;microfiber structure (GMF) utilizing the lab-on-rod technique was demonstrated in this study. Owing to its unique spring-like geometry, an ultra-long GMF interaction can be achieved, and a modulation depth of &#8764;7.5 dB (&#8764;2.5 dB) and a modulation efficiency of &#8764;0.2 dB mW<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (&#8764;0.07 dB mW<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) were demonstrated for two polarization states. The modulation depth and modulation efficiency are more than one order of magnitude larger than those of other graphene&#8211;microfiber hybrid all-optical modulators, although at the cost of a higher insertion loss. By further optimizing the transferring and cleaning process, the upper limit of the modulation depth is mainly determined by the loss from the intrinsic absorption, which depends on the light&#8211;graphene interaction. Then, the modulator can quickly switch between the on-state and the off-state with a theoretically maximized modulation depth of tens of decibels. This modulator is compatible with the current fiber-optic communication systems and may be applied in the near future to meet the impending need for ultrafast optical signal processing.</p>",[],True,"[""Jin-Hui Chen"", ""Bi-Cai Zheng"", ""Guang-Hao Shao"", ""Shi-Jun Ge"", ""Fei Xu"", ""Yan-Qing Lu""]","Chen, JH., Zheng, BC., Shao, GH. et al.

original article,Tailoring color emissions from N-doped graphene quantum dots for bioimaging applications,"<p>Unlike inorganic quantum dots, fluorescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) display excitation-dependent multiple color emission. In this study, we report N-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) with tailored single color emission by tuning &#960;-conjugation degree, which is comparable to the inorganic quantum dot. Starting from citric acid and diethylenetriamine, as prepared N-GQDs display blue, green, and yellow light emission by changing the reaction solvent from water, dimethylformamide (DMF), and solvent free. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectra results clearly show the N-GQDs with blue emission (N-GQDs-B) have relatively short effective conjugation length and more carboxyl group because H<sub>2</sub>O is a polar protic solvent, which tends to donate proton to the reagent to depress the H<sub>2</sub>O elimination reaction. On the other hand, the polar aprotic solvent (DMF) cannot donate hydrogen, the elimination of H<sub>2</sub>O is promoted and more nitrogen units enter GQD framework. With the increase of effective &#960;-conjugation length and N content, the emission band of N-GQDS red-shifts to green and yellow. We also demonstrate that N-GQDs could be a potential great biomarker for fluorescent bioimaging.</p>",[],True,"[""Dan Qu"", ""Min Zheng"", ""Jing Li"", ""Zhigang Xie"", ""Zaicheng Sun""]","Qu, D., Zheng, M., Li, J. et al.

original article,Nonlinear optical selection rule based on valley-exciton locking in monolayer ws2,"<p>Optical selection rules fundamentally determine the optical transitions between energy states in a variety of physical systems, from hydrogen atoms to bulk crystals such as gallium arsenide. These rules are important for optoelectronic applications such as lasers, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and quantum computation. Recently, single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides have been found to exhibit valleys in momentum space with nontrivial Berry curvature and excitons with large binding energy. However, there has been little study of how the unique valley degree of freedom combined with the strong excitonic effect influences the nonlinear optical excitation. Here, we report the discovery of nonlinear optical selection rules in monolayer WS<sub>2</sub>, an important candidate for visible 2D optoelectronics because of its high quantum yield and large direct bandgap. We experimentally demonstrated this principle for second-harmonic generation and two-photon luminescence (TPL). Moreover, the circularly polarized TPL and the study of its dynamics evince a sub-ps interexciton relaxation (2p &#8594; 1s). The discovery of this new optical selection rule in a valleytronic 2D system not only considerably enhances knowledge in this area but also establishes a foundation for the control of optical transitions that will be crucial for valley optoelectronic device applications such as 2D valley-polarized THz sources with 2p&#8211;1s transitions, optical switches, and coherent control for quantum computing.</p>",[],True,"[""Jun Xiao"", ""Ziliang Ye"", ""Ying Wang"", ""Hanyu Zhu"", ""Yuan Wang"", ""Xiang Zhang""]","Xiao, J., Ye, Z., Wang, Y. et al.

review,Doped GaSe crystals for laser frequency conversion,"<p>In this review, we introduce the current state of the art of the growth technology of pure, lightly doped, and heavily doped (solid solution) nonlinear gallium selenide (GaSe) crystals that are able to generate broadband emission from the near infrared (IR) (0.8 &#956;m) through the mid- and far-IR (terahertz (THz)) ranges and further into the millimeter wave (5.64 mm) range. For the first time, we show that appropriate doping is an efficient method controlling a range of the physical properties of GaSe crystals that are responsible for frequency conversion efficiency and exploitation parameters. After appropriate doping, uniform crystals grown by a modified technology with heat field rotation possess up to 3 times lower absorption coefficient in the main transparency window and THz range. Moreover, doping provides the following benefits: raises by up to 5 times the optical damage threshold; almost eliminates two-photon absorption; allows for dispersion control in the THz range independent of the mid-IR dispersion; and enables crystal processing in arbitrary directions due to the strengthened lattice. Finally, doped GaSe demonstrated better usefulness for processing compared with GaSe grown by the conventional technology and up to 15 times higher frequency conversion efficiency.</p>",[],True,"[""Jin Guo"", ""Ji-Jiang Xie"", ""Dian-Jun Li"", ""Gui-Long Yang"", ""Fei Chen"", ""Chun-Rui Wang"", ""Lai-Ming Zhang"", ""Yury M Andreev"", ""Konstantin A Kokh"", ""Gregory V Lanskii"", ""Valery A Svetlichnyi""]","Guo, J., Xie, JJ., Li, DJ. et al.
