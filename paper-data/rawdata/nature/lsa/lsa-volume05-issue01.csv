original article,Label-free detection of single nanoparticles and biological molecules using microtoroid optical resonators,"<p>Single-molecule detection is one of the fundamental challenges of modern biology. Such experiments often use labels that can be expensive, difficult to produce, and for small analytes, might perturb the molecular events being studied. Analyte size plays an important role in determining detectability. Here we use laser-frequency locking in the context of sensing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of microtoroid optical resonators to the extent that single nanoparticles 2.5 nm in radius, and 15.5 kDa molecules are detected in aqueous solution, thereby bringing these detectors to the size limits needed for detecting the key macromolecules of the cell. Our results, covering several orders of magnitude of particle radius (100 nm to 2 nm), agree with the &#8216;reactive&#8217; model prediction for the frequency shift of the resonator upon particle binding. This confirms that the main contribution of the frequency shift for the resonator upon particle binding is an increase in the effective path length due to part of the evanescent field coupling into the adsorbed particle. We anticipate that our results will enable many applications, including more sensitive medical diagnostics and fundamental studies of single receptor&#8211;ligand and protein&#8211;protein interactions in real time.</p>",[],True,"[""Judith Su"", ""Alexander FG Goldberg"", ""Brian M Stoltz""]","Su, J., Goldberg, A. & Stoltz, B.

original article,High-efficiency surface plasmon meta-couplers: concept and microwave-regime realizations,"<p>Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and their low-frequency counterparts (i.e., spoof SPPs on artificial surfaces) have recently found numerous applications in photonics, but traditional devices to excite them (such as gratings and prism couplers) all suffer from problems of inherent low efficiency because the generated SPPs can decouple, returning to free space, and reflections at the device surface can never be avoided. Here, we propose a new SPP excitation scheme based on a transparent gradient metasurface and numerically demonstrate that it exhibits inherently high efficiency (~94%) because the designed meta-coupler suppresses both decoupling and surface reflections. As a practical realization of this concept, we fabricated a meta-coupler for operation in the microwave regime and performed near-field and far-field experiments to demonstrate that the achieved excitation efficiency for spoof SPPs reaches ~73%, which is several times higher than that achieved by other available devices in this frequency domain. Our findings can motivate the design and fabrication of high-performance plasmonic devices to harvest light&#8211;matter interactions, particularly those related to spoof SPPs in the low-frequency domain.</p>",[],True,"[""Wujiong Sun"", ""Qiong He"", ""Shulin Sun"", ""Lei Zhou""]","Sun, W., He, Q., Sun, S. et al.

original article,Variable optofluidic slit aperture,"<p>The shape of liquid interfaces can be precisely controlled using electrowetting, an actuation mechanism which has been widely used for tunable optofluidic micro-optical components such as lenses or irises. We have expanded the considerable flexibility inherent in electrowetting actuation to realize a variable optofluidic slit, a tunable and reconfigurable two-dimensional aperture with no mechanically moving parts. This optofluidic slit is formed by precisely controlled movement of the liquid interfaces of two highly opaque ink droplets. The 1.5 mm long slit aperture, with controllably variable discrete widths down to 45 &#181;m, may be scanned across a length of 1.5 mm with switching times between adjacent slit positions of less than 120 ms. In addition, for a fixed slit aperture position, the width may be tuned to a minimum of 3 &#181;m with high uniformity and linearity over the entire slit length. This compact, purely fluidic device offers an electrically controlled aperture tuning range not achievable with extant mechanical alternatives of a similar size.</p>",[],True,"[""Stefan Schuhladen"", ""Kaustubh Banerjee"", ""Moritz St\u00fcrmer"", ""Philipp M\u00fcller"", ""Ulrike Wallrabe"", ""Hans Zappe""]","Schuhladen, S., Banerjee, K., Stürmer, M. et al.

original article,Correction-free remotely scanned two-photon in vivo mouse retinal imaging,"<p>Non-invasive fluorescence retinal imaging in small animals is an important requirement for an array of translational vision applications. The in vivo two-photon imaging of the mouse retina may enable the long-term investigation of the structure and function of healthy and diseased retinal tissue. However, to date, this has only been possible using relatively complex adaptive-optics systems. Here, the optical modeling of the murine eye and of the imaging system is used to achieve correction-free two-photon microscopy through the pupil of a mouse eye to yield high-quality, optically sectioned fundus images. By remotely scanning the focus using an electronically tunable lens, high-resolution three-dimensional fluorescein angiograms and cellular-scale images are acquired, thus introducing a correction-free baseline performance level for two-photon in vivo retinal imaging. Moreover, the system enables functional calcium imaging of repeated retinal responses to light stimulation using the genetically encoded indicator, GCaMP6s. These results and the simplicity of the new add-on optics are an important step toward several structural, functional, and multimodal imaging applications that will benefit from the tight optical sectioning and the use of near-infrared light.</p>",[],True,"[""Adi Schejter Bar-Noam"", ""Nairouz Farah"", ""Shy Shoham""]","Bar-Noam, A., Farah, N. & Shoham, S.

original article,Silver nanoislands on cellulose fibers for chromatographic separation and ultrasensitive detection of small molecules,"<p>High-throughput small-molecule assays play essential roles in biomedical diagnosis, drug discovery, environmental analysis, and physiological function research. Nanoplasmonics holds a great potential for the label-free detection of small molecules at extremely low concentrations. Here, we report the development of nanoplasmonic paper (NP-paper) for the rapid separation and ultrasensitive detection of mixed small molecules. NP-paper employs nanogap-rich silver nanoislands on cellulose fibers, which were simply fabricated at the wafer level by using low-temperature solid-state dewetting of a thin silver film. The nanoplasmonic detection allows for the scalable quantification and identification of small molecules over broad concentration ranges. Moreover, the combination of chromatographic separation and nanoplasmonic detection allows both the highly sensitive fluorescence detection of mixed small molecules at the attogram level and the label-free detection at the sub-nanogram level based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering. This novel material provides a new diagnostic platform for the high-throughput, low-cost, and label-free screening of mixed small molecules as an alternative to conventional paper chromatography.</p>",[],True,"[""Hyukjin Jung"", ""Moonseong Park"", ""Minhee Kang"", ""Ki-Hun Jeong""]","Jung, H., Park, M., Kang, M. et al.

original article,Multi-scale polarisation phenomena,"<p>Multi-scale methods that separate different time or spatial scales are among the most powerful techniques in physics, especially in applications that study nonlinear systems with noise. When the time scales (noise and perturbation) are of the same order, the scales separation becomes impossible. Thus, the multi-scale approach has to be modified to characterise a variety of noise-induced phenomena. Here, based on stochastic modelling and analytical study, we demonstrate in terms of the fluctuation-induced phenomena and Hurst R/S analysis metrics that the matching scales of random birefringence and pump&#8211;signal states of polarisation interaction in a fibre Raman amplifier results in a new random birefringence-mediated phenomenon, which is similar to stochastic anti-resonance. The observed phenomenon, apart from the fundamental interest, provides a base for advancing multi-scale methods with application to different coupled nonlinear systems ranging from lasers (multimode, mode-locked, random, etc.) to nanostructures (light-mediated conformation of molecules and chemical reactions, Brownian motors, etc.).</p>",[],True,"[""Vladimir Kalashnikov"", ""Sergey V Sergeyev"", ""Gunnar Jacobsen"", ""Sergei Popov"", ""Sergei K Turitsyn""]","Kalashnikov, V., Sergeyev, S., Jacobsen, G. et al.

original article,Second harmonic generation spectroscopy on hybrid plasmonic/dielectric nanoantennas,"<p>Plasmonic nanoantennas provide unprecedented opportunities to concentrate light fields in subwavelength-sized volumes. By placing a nonlinear dielectric nanoparticle in such a hot spot, one can hope to take advantage of both the field enhancement provided by nanoantennas and the large, nonlinear optical susceptibility of dielectric nanoparticles. To test this concept, we combine gold gap nanoantennas with second-order, nonlinear zinc sulfide nanoparticles, and perform second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy on the combined hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoantennas as well as on the individual constituents. We find that SHG from the bare gold nanoantennas, even though it should be forbidden due to symmetry reasons, is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the bare zinc sulfide nanoparticles. Even stronger second harmonic signals are generated by the hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoantennas. Control experiments with nanoantennas containing linear lanthanum fluoride nanoparticles reveal; however, that the increased SHG efficiency of the hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoantennas does not depend on the nonlinear optical susceptibility of the dielectric nanoparticles but is an effect of the modification of the dielectric environment. The combination of a hybrid dielectric/plasmonic nanoantenna, which is only resonant for the incoming pump light field, with a second nanoantenna, which is resonant for the generated second harmonic light, allows for a further increase in the efficiency of SHG. As the second nanoantenna mediates the coupling of the second harmonic light to the far field, this double-resonant approach also provides us with control over the polarization of the generated light.</p>",[],True,"[""Heiko Linnenbank"", ""Yevgen Grynko"", ""Jens F\u00f6rstner"", ""Stefan Linden""]","Linnenbank, H., Grynko, Y., Förstner, J. et al.

original article,Tunable synchrotron-like radiation from centimeter scale plasma channels,"<p>Synchrotron radiation (SR) sources are immensely useful tools for scientific researches and many practical applications. Currently, the state-of-the-art synchrotrons rely on conventional accelerators, where electrons are accelerated in a straight line and radiate in bending magnets or other insertion devices. However, these facilities are usually large and costly. Here, we study a compact all optical synchrotron-like radiation source based on laser-plasma acceleration either in a straight or a curved plasma channel. With the laser pulse off-axially injected, its centroid oscillates transversely in the plasma channel. This results in a wiggler motion of the whole accelerating structure and the self-trapped electrons behind the laser pulse, leading to strong synchrotron-like radiations with tunable spectra. It is further shown that a palmtop ring-shaped synchrotron is possible with current high power laser technologies. With its potential of high flexibility and tunability, such light sources once realized would find applications in wide areas and make up the shortage of large SR facilities.</p>",[],True,"[""Min Chen"", ""Ji Luo"", ""Fei-Yu Li"", ""Feng Liu"", ""Zheng-Ming Sheng"", ""Jie Zhang""]","Chen, M., Luo, J., Li, FY. et al.

original article,Orbital angular momentum photonic quantum interface,"<p>Light-carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has great potential in enhancing the information channel capacity in both classical and quantum optical communications. Long distance optical communication requires the wavelengths of light are situated in the low-loss communication windows, but most quantum memories currently being developed for use in a quantum repeater work at different wavelengths, so a quantum interface to bridge the wavelength gap is necessary. So far, such an interface for OAM-carried light has not been realized yet. Here, we report the first experimental realization of a quantum interface for a heralded single photon carrying OAM using a nonlinear crystal in an optical cavity.

original article,Repulsion of polarised particles from anisotropic materials with a near-zero permittivity component,"<p>Reduction of adhesion and stiction is crucial for robust operation on nanomechanical and optofluidic devices as well as atom and molecule behaviour near surfaces. It can be achieved using electric charging, magnetic materials or light pressure and optical trapping. Here we show that a particle scattering or emitting in close proximity to an anisotropic substrate can experience a repulsive force if one of the diagonal components of the permittivity tensor is close to zero. We derive an analytic condition for the existence of such repulsive force depending on the optical properties of the substrate. We also demonstrate the effect using realistic anisotropic metamaterial implementations of a substrate.
