review,Energy transfer in plasmonic photocatalytic composites,"<p>Among the many novel photocatalytic systems developed in very recent years, plasmonic photocatalytic composites possess great potential for use in applications and are one of the most intensively investigated photocatalytic systems owing to their high solar energy utilization efficiency. In these composites, the plasmonic nanoparticles (PNPs) efficiently absorb solar light through localized surface plasmon resonance and convert it into energetic electrons and holes in the nearby semiconductor. This energy transfer from PNPs to semiconductors plays a decisive role in the overall photocatalytic performance. Thus, the underlying physical mechanism is of great scientific and technological importance and is one of the hottest topics in the area of plasmonic photocatalysts. In this review, we examine the very recent advances in understanding the energy transfer process in plasmonic photocatalytic composites, describing both the theoretical basis of this process and experimental demonstrations. The factors that affect the energy transfer efficiencies and how to improve the efficiencies to yield better photocatalytic performance are also discussed. Furthermore, comparisons are made between the various energy transfer processes, emphasizing their limitations/benefits for efficient operation of plasmonic photocatalysts.</p>",[],True,"[""Xiang-Chao Ma"", ""Ying Dai"", ""Lin Yu"", ""Bai-Biao Huang""]","Ma, XC., Dai, Y., Yu, L. et al.

original article,A single Eu2+-activated high-color-rendering oxychloride white-light phosphor for white-light-emitting diodes,"<p>Single-phased, high-color-rendering index (CRI) white-light phosphors are emerging as potential phosphor-converted white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and as an alternative to blends of tricolor phosphors. However, it is a challenge to create a high CRI white light from a single-doped activator. Here, we present a high CRI (Ra = 91) white-light phosphor, Sr<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3-x</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub>Cl:Eu<sup>2+</sup>, composed of Sr<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl as the beginning member and Sr<sub>5</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl as the end member. This work utilized the solid-solution method, and tunable Eu<sup>2+</sup> emission was achieved. Color-tunable Eu<sup>2+</sup> emissions in response to structural variation were observed in Sr<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3-x</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub>Cl solid solutions. This was further confirmed using X-ray Rietveld refinement, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and in the photoluminescence spectra. The color-tunable emissions included the white light that originated from the combination of the blue emission of Sr<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl:Eu<sup>2+</sup> and an induced Eu<sup>2+</sup> yellow emission at approximately 550 nm in the solid solution. Importantly, the white-light phosphors showed a greater R9 = 90.2 under excitation at 365 nm. This result has rarely been reported in the literature and is greater than that of (R9 = 14.3) commercial Y<sub>3</sub>A<sub>l5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce<sup>3+</sup>-based WLEDs. These findings demonstrate the great potential of Sr<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3-x</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub>Cl:0.04Eu<sup>2+</sup> as a white-light phosphor for near-UV phosphor-converted WLEDs. These results also provide a shortcut for developing a high CRI white-light phosphor from a single Eu<sup>2+</sup>-doped compound.</p>",[],True,"[""Peng-Peng Dai"", ""Cong Li"", ""Xin-Tong Zhang"", ""Jun Xu"", ""Xi Chen"", ""Xiu-Li Wang"", ""Yan Jia"", ""Xiaojun Wang"", ""Yi-Chun Liu""]","Dai, PP., Li, C., Zhang, XT. et al.A single Eu2+-activated high-color-rendering oxychloride white-light phosphor for white-light-emitting diodes.

original article,An ultra-narrow linewidth solution-processed organic laser,"<p>Optically pumped lasers based on solution-processed thin-film gain media have recently emerged as low-cost, broadly tunable, and versatile active photonics components that can fit any substrate and are useful for, e.g., chemo- or biosensing or visible spectroscopy. Although single-mode operation has been demonstrated in various resonator architectures with a large variety of gain media&#8212;including dye-doped polymers, organic semiconductors, and, more recently, hybrid perovskites&#8212;the reported linewidths are typically on the order of a fraction of a nanometer or broader, i.e., the coherence lengths are no longer than a few millimeters, which does not enable high-resolution spectroscopy or coherent sensing. The linewidth is fundamentally constrained by the short photon cavity lifetime in the standard resonator geometries. We demonstrate here a novel structure for an organic thin-film solid-state laser that is based on a vertical external cavity, wherein a holographic volume Bragg grating ensures both spectral selection and output coupling in an otherwise very compact (&#8764;cm<sup>3</sup>) design. Under short-pulse (0.4 ns) pumping, Fourier-transform-limited laser pulses are obtained, with a full width at half-maximum linewidth of 900 MHz (1.25 pm). Using 20-ns-long pump pulses, the linewidth can be further reduced to 200 MHz (0.26 pm), which is four times above the Fourier limit and corresponds to an unprecedented coherence length of 1 m. The concept is potentially transferrable to any type of thin-film laser and can be ultimately made tunable; it also represents a very compact alternative to bulky grating systems in dye lasers.</p>",[],True,"[""Oussama Mhibik"", ""Sebastien Forget"", ""Dan Ott"", ""George Venus"", ""Ivan Divliansky"", ""Leonid Glebov"", ""Sebastien Ch\u00e9nais""]","Mhibik, O., Forget, S., Ott, D. et al.

original article,A sensing mechanism for the detection of carbon nanotubes using selective photoluminescent probes based on ionic complexes with organic dyes,"<p>The multifunctional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) make them a powerful platform for unprecedented innovations in a variety of practical applications. As a result of the surging growth of nanotechnology, nanotubes present a potential problem as an environmental pollutant, and as such, an efficient method for their rapid detection must be established. Here, we propose a novel type of ionic sensor complex for detecting CNTs &#8211; an organic dye that responds sensitively and selectively to CNTs with a photoluminescent signal. The complexes are formed through Coulomb attractions between dye molecules with uncompensated charges and CNTs covered with an ionic surfactant in water. We demonstrate that the photoluminescent excitation of the dye can be transferred to the nanotubes, resulting in selective and strong amplification (up to a factor of 6) of the light emission from the excitonic levels of CNTs in the near-infrared spectral range, as experimentally observed via excitation-emission photoluminescence (PL) mapping. The chirality of the nanotubes and the type of ionic surfactant used to disperse the nanotubes both strongly affect the amplification; thus, the complexation provides sensing selectivity towards specific CNTs. Additionally, neither similar uncharged dyes nor CNTs covered with neutral surfactant form such complexes. As model organic molecules, we use a family of polymethine dyes with an easily tailorable molecular structure and, consequently, tunable absorbance and PL characteristics. This provides us with a versatile tool for the controllable photonic and electronic engineering of an efficient probe for CNT detection.</p>",[],True,"[""Petro Lutsyk"", ""Raz Arif"", ""Jan Hruby"", ""Anatolii Bukivskyi"", ""Olexander Vinijchuk"", ""Mykola Shandura"", ""Viktor Yakubovskyi"", ""Yuri Kovtun"", ""Graham A Rance"", ""Michael Fay"", ""Yuri Piryatinski"", ""Oleksiy Kachkovsky"", ""Anatoli Verbitsky"", ""Aleksey Rozhin""]","Lutsyk, P., Arif, R., Hruby, J. et al.A sensing mechanism for the detection of carbon nanotubes using selective photoluminescent probes based on ionic complexes with organic dyes.

However, white LEDs using phosphor(s) suffer from unavoidable Stokes energy converting losses, higher manufacturing cost, and reduced thermal stability. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven, phosphor-free, white LEDs based on three-dimensional gallium nitride structures with double concentric truncated hexagonal pyramids. The electroluminescence spectra are stable with varying current. The origin of the emission wavelength is studied by cathodoluminescence and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments.

original article,Efficient photon coupling from a diamond nitrogen vacancy center by integration with silica fiber,"<p>A central goal in quantum information science is to efficiently interface photons with single optical modes for quantum networking and distributed quantum computing. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact and efficient method for the low-loss coupling of a solid-state qubit, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, with a single-mode optical fiber. In this approach, single-mode tapered diamond waveguides containing exactly one high quality NV memory are selected and integrated on tapered silica fibers. Numerical optimization of an adiabatic coupler indicates that near-unity-efficiency photon transfer is possible between the two modes. Experimentally, we find an overall collection efficiency between 16% and 37% and estimate a single photon count rate at saturation above 700 kHz. This integrated system enables robust, alignment-free, and efficient interfacing of single-mode optical fibers with single photon emitters and quantum memories in solids.</p>",[],True,"[""Rishi N Patel"", ""Tim Schr\u00f6der"", ""Noel Wan"", ""Luozhou Li"", ""Sara L Mouradian"", ""Edward H Chen"", ""Dirk R Englund""]","Patel, R., Schröder, T., Wan, N. et al.

original article,On-chip photonic Fourier transform with surface plasmon polaritons,"<p>The Fourier transform (FT), a cornerstone of optical processing, enables rapid evaluation of fundamental mathematical operations, such as derivatives and integrals. Conventionally, a converging lens performs an optical FT in free space when light passes through it. The speed of the transformation is limited by the thickness and the focal length of the lens. By using the wave nature of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), here we demonstrate that the FT can be implemented in a planar configuration with a minimal propagation distance of around 10 &#956;m, resulting in an increase of speed by four to five orders of magnitude. The photonic FT was tested by synthesizing intricate SPP waves with their Fourier components. The reduced dimensionality in the minuscule device allows the future development of an ultrafast on-chip photonic information processing platform for large-scale optical computing.</p>",[],True,"[""Shan Shan Kou"", ""Guanghui Yuan"", ""Qian Wang"", ""Luping Du"", ""Eugeniu Balaur"", ""Daohua Zhang"", ""Dingyuan Tang"", ""Brian Abbey"", ""Xiao-Cong Yuan"", ""Jiao Lin""]","Kou, S., Yuan, G., Wang, Q. et al.

CNTs have attracted significant research interest because they can be functionalized for a particular chemical, yielding a specific physical response which suggests many potential applications in the fields of nanotechnology and sensing. So far, however, utilizing their optical properties for this purpose has proven to be challenging. We demonstrate the use of localized surface plasmons generated on a nanostructured thin film, resembling a large array of nano-wires, to detect changes in the optical properties of the CNTs. Chemical selectivity is demonstrated using CO<sub>2</sub> in gaseous form at room temperature.

original article,Deep subwavelength nanometric image reconstruction using Fourier domain optical normalization,"<p>Quantitative optical measurements of deep subwavelength, three-dimensional (3D), nanometric structures with sensitivity to sub-nanometer details address a ubiquitous measurement challenge. A Fourier domain normalization approach is used in the Fourier optical imaging code to simulate the full 3D scattered light field of nominally 15 nm-sized structures, accurately replicating the light field as a function of the focus position. Using the full 3D light field, nanometer scale details such as a 2 nm thin conformal oxide and nanometer topography are rigorously fitted for features less than one-thirtieth of the wavelength in size. The densely packed structures are positioned nearly an order of magnitude closer than the conventional Rayleigh resolution limit and can be measured with sub-nanometer parametric uncertainties. This approach enables a practical measurement sensitivity to size variations of only a few atoms in size using a high-throughput optical configuration with broad application in measuring nanometric structures and nanoelectronic devices.</p>",[],True,"[""Jing Qin"", ""Richard M Silver"", ""Bryan M Barnes"", ""Hui Zhou"", ""Ronald G Dixson"", ""Mark-Alexander Henn""]","Qin, J., Silver, R., Barnes, B. et al.
