review,Optical second-harmonic generation measurement for probing organic device operation,"<p>We give a brief overview of the electric-field induced optical second-harmonic generation (EFISHG) technique that has been used to study the complex behaviors of organic-based devices. By analyzing EFISHG images of organic field-effect transistors, the in-plane two-dimensional distribution of the electric field in the channel can be evaluated. The susceptibility tensor of the organic semiconductor layer and the polarization of the incident light are considered to determine the electric field distribution. EFISHG imaging can effectively evaluate the distribution of the vectorial electric field in organic films by selecting a light polarization. With the time-resolved technique, measurement of the electric field originating from the injected carriers allows direct probing of the carrier motion under device operation, because the transient change of the electric field distribution reflects the carrier motion. Some applications of the EFISHG technique to organic electronic devices are reviewed.</p>",[],True,"[""Takaaki Manaka"", ""Mitsumasa Iwamoto""]","Manaka, T., Iwamoto, M.

original article,Organic semiconductor heterojunctions: electrode-independent charge injectors for high-performance organic light-emitting diodes,"<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are driven by injected charges from an anode and a cathode. The low and high work function metals are necessary for the effective injection of electrons and holes, respectively. Here, we introduce a fully novel design concept using organic semiconductor heterojunctions (OSHJs) as the charge injectors for achieving highly efficient OLEDs, regardless of the work functions of the electrodes. In contrast to traditional injected charges from the electrodes, the injected charges originate from the OSHJs. The device performance was shown to be significantly improved in efficiency and stability compared to conventional OLEDs. Attractively, the OLEDs based on OSHJs as charge injectors still exhibited an impressive performance when the low work function Al was replaced by air- and chemistry-stable high work function metals, such as Au, Ag, and Cu, as the cathode contact, which has been suggested to be difficult in conventional OLEDs. This concept challenges the conventional design approach for the injection of charges and allows for the realization of practical applications of OLEDs with respect to high efficiency, selectable electrodes, and a long lifetime.</p>",[],True,"[""Yong-Hua Chen"", ""Dong-Ge Ma"", ""Heng-Da Sun"", ""Jiang-Shan Chen"", ""Qing-Xun Guo"", ""Qiang Wang"", ""Yong-Biao Zhao""]","Chen, YH., Ma, DG., Sun, HD. et al.

original article,Spatial separation effects in a guiding procedure in a modified ion-beam-sputtering process,"<p>In the present state of the art, ion beam sputtering is used to produce low-loss dielectric optics. During the manufacturing of a dielectric layer stack, the deposition material must be changed, which requires rapid mechanical movement of vacuum components. These mechanical components can be regarded as a risk factor for contamination during the coating process, which limits the quality of high-end laser components. To minimize the particle contamination, we present a novel deposition concept that does not require movable components to change the coating material during the coating process. A magnetic field guiding technique has been developed, which enables the tuning of the refractive index in the layer structure by sputtering mixtures with varying compositions of two materials using a single-ion source. The versatility of this new concept is demonstrated for a high-reflection mirror.</p>",[],True,"[""Sina Malobabic"", ""Marco Jup\u00e9"", ""Detlev Ristau""]","Malobabic, S., Jup√©, M. & Ristau, D.

original article,Atomically thin optical lenses and gratings,"<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for miniaturized optoelectronic devices due to their strong inelastic interactions with light. On the other hand, a miniaturized optical system also requires strong elastic light&#8211;matter interactions to control the flow of light. Here we report that a single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) has a giant optical path length (OPL), around one order of magnitude larger than that from a single-layer of graphene. Using such giant OPL to engineer the phase front of optical beams we have demonstrated, to the best of our knowledge, the world&#8217;s thinnest optical lens consisting of a few layers of MoS<sub>2</sub> less than 6.3 nm thick. By taking advantage of the giant elastic scattering efficiency in ultra-thin high-index 2D materials, we also demonstrated high-efficiency gratings based on a single- or few-layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The capability of manipulating the flow of light in 2D materials opens an exciting avenue towards unprecedented miniaturization of optical components and the integration of advanced optical functionalities. More importantly, the unique and large tunability of the refractive index by electric field in layered MoS<sub>2</sub> will enable various applications in electrically tunable atomically thin optical components, such as micro-lenses with electrically tunable focal lengths, electrical tunable phase shifters with ultra-high accuracy, which cannot be realized by conventional bulk solids.</p>",[],True,"[""Jiong Yang"", ""Zhu Wang"", ""Fan Wang"", ""Renjing Xu"", ""Jin Tao"", ""Shuang Zhang"", ""Qinghua Qin"", ""Barry Luther-Davies"", ""Chennupati Jagadish"", ""Zongfu Yu"", ""Yuerui Lu""]","Yang, J., Wang, Z., Wang, F. et al.

original article,Point spread function estimation from projected speckle illumination,"<p>The resolution of an imaging apparatus is ideally limited by the diffraction properties of the light passing through the system aperture, but in many practical cases, inhomogeneities in the light propagating medium or imperfections in the optics degrade the image resolution. Here we introduce a powerful and practical new approach for estimating the point spread function (PSF) of an imaging system on the basis of PSF Estimation from Projected Speckle Illumination (PEPSI). PEPSI uses the fact that the speckles&#8217; phase randomness cancels the effects of the aberrations in the illumination path, thereby providing an objective pattern for measuring the deformation of the imaging path. Using this approach, both wide-field-of-view and local-PSF estimation can be obtained by calibration-free, single-speckle-pattern projection. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of using PEPSI estimates for resolution improvement in iterative maximum likelihood deconvolution.</p>",[],True,"[""Nizan Meitav"", ""Erez N Ribak"", ""Shy Shoham""]","Meitav, N., Ribak, E. & Shoham, S.

original article,Luminescent line art by direct-write patterning,"<p>We present a direct-write patterning method for the realization of electroluminescent (EL) line art using a surface-emissive light-emitting electrochemical cell with its electrolyte and EL material separated into a bilayer structure. The line-art emission is achieved through subtractive patterning of the electrolyte layer with a stylus, and the single-step patterning can be either manual for personalization and uniqueness or automated for high throughput and repeatability. We demonstrate that the light emission is effectuated by cation-assisted electron injection in the patterned regions and that the resulting emissive lines can be as narrow as a few micrometers. The versatility of the method is demonstrated through the attainment of a wide range of light-emission patterns and colors using a variety of different materials. We propose that this low-voltage-driven and easy-to-modify luminescent line-art technology could be of interest for emerging applications, such as active packaging and personalized gadgets.</p>",[],True,"[""Erik Mattias Lindh"", ""Andreas Sandstr\u00f6m"", ""Mats Roland Andersson"", ""Ludvig Edman""]","Lindh, E., Sandstr√∂m, A., Andersson, M. et al.

original article,Angle-selective perfect absorption with two-dimensional materials,"<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have great potential in photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, the relatively weak light absorption in 2D materials hinders their application in practical devices. Here, we propose a general approach to achieve angle-selective perfect light absorption in 2D materials. As a demonstration of the concept, we experimentally show giant light absorption by placing large-area single-layer graphene on a structure consisting of a chalcogenide layer atop a mirror and achieving a total absorption of 77.6% in the mid-infrared wavelength range (~13&#8201;&#956;m), where the graphene contributes a record-high 47.2% absorptivity of mid-infrared light. Construction of such an angle-selective thin optical element is important for solar and thermal energy harvesting, photo-detection and sensing applications. Our study points to a new opportunity to combine 2D materials with photonic structures to enable novel device applications.</p>",[],True,"[""Linxiao Zhu"", ""Fengyuan Liu"", ""Hongtao Lin"", ""Juejun Hu"", ""Zongfu Yu"", ""Xinran Wang"", ""Shanhui Fan""]","Zhu, L., Liu, F., Lin, H. et al.

original article,Optically controlled magnetic-field etching on the nano-scale,"<p>Electric and magnetic fields play an important role in both chemical and physical reactions. However, since the coupling efficiency between magnetic fields and electrons is low in comparison with that between electric fields and electrons in the visible wavelength region, the magnetic field is negligible in photo-induced reactions. Here, we performed photo-etching of ZrO<sub>2</sub> nano-stripe structures, and identified an etching-property polarisation dependence. Specifically, the etching rate and etched profiles depend on the structure width. To evaluate this polarisation-dependent etching, we performed numerical calculations using a finite-difference time-domain method. Remarkably, the numerical results revealed that the polarisation-dependent etching properties were determined by the magnetic field distributions, rather than the electric field distributions. As nano-scale structures induce a localised magnetic field, the discovery of this etching dependence on the magnetic field is expected to introduce a new perspective on advanced nano-scale structure fabrication.</p>",[],True,"[""Takashi Yatsui"", ""Toshiki Tsuboi"", ""Maiku Yamaguchi"", ""Katsuyuki Nobusada"", ""Satoshi Tojo"", ""Fabrice Stehlin"", ""Olivier Soppera"", ""Daniel Bloch""]","Yatsui, T., Tsuboi, T., Yamaguchi, M. et al.
