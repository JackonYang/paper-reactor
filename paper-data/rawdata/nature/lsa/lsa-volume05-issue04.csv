original article,Photoexcitation dynamics in solution-processed formamidinium lead iodide perovskite thin films for solar cell applications,"<p>Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) is a newly developed hybrid perovskite that potentially can be used in high-efficiency solution-processed solar cells. Here, the temperature-dependent dynamic optical properties of three types of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite films (fabricated using three different precursor systems) are comparatively studied. The time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra reveal that FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films made from the new precursor (a mixture of formamidinium iodide and hydrogen lead triiodide) exhibit the longest lifetime of 439&#8201;ns at room temperature, suggesting a lower number of defects and lower non-radiative recombination losses compared with FAPbI<sub>3</sub> obtained from the other two precursors. From the temperature-dependent PL spectra, a phase transition in the films is clearly observed. Meanwhile, exciton-binding energies of 8.1 and 18&#8201;meV for the high- and low-temperature phases are extracted, respectively. Importantly, the PL spectra for all of the samples show a single peak at room temperature, whereas at liquid-helium temperature the emission features two peaks: one in higher energy displaying a fast decay (0.5&#8201;ns) and a second red-shifted peak with a decay of up to several microseconds. These two emissions, separated by ~18&#8201;meV, are attributed to free excitons and bound excitons with singlet and triplet characters, respectively.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Photophysics & OptoElectronics, Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, Nijenborgh 4, Groningen, 9747 AG, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Hong-Hua Fang', ',\xa0Sampson Adjokatse', '\xa0&\xa0Maria Antonietta Loi']}, {'address': 'Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong', 'authors': ['Feng Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Ni Zhao']}, {'address': 'Université Européenne de Bretagne, INSA, FOTON, UMR 6082, Rennes, 35708, France', 'authors': ['Jacky Even']}]",True,"['Hong-Hua Fang', 'Feng Wang', 'Sampson Adjokatse', 'Ni Zhao', 'Jacky Even', 'Maria Antonietta Loi']","Fang, H., Wang, F., Adjokatse, S. et al.

original article,An imaging spectrometer employing tunable hyperchromatic microlenses,"<p>We present the design, fabrication and characterization of hydraulically-tunable hyperchromatic lenses for two-dimensional (2D) spectrally-resolved spectral imaging. These hyperchromatic lenses, consisting of a positive diffractive lens and a tunable concave lens, are designed to have a large longitudinal chromatic dispersion and thus axially separate the images of different wavelengths from each other. 2D objects of different wavelengths can consequently be imaged using the tunability of the lens system. Two hyperchromatic lens concepts are demonstrated and their spectral characteristics as well as their functionality in spectral imaging applications are shown.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Microsystems Engineering, Gisela and Erwin Sick Chair of Micro-optics, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, 79110, Germany', 'authors': ['Phuong-Ha Cu-Nguyen', ',\xa0Andreas Seifert', '\xa0&\xa0Hans Zappe']}, {'address': 'Fachgebiet Technische Optik, Institut fur Mikro- und Nanotechnologien, Technische Universitat Ilmenau, Ilmenau, 98684, Germany', 'authors': ['Adrian Grewe', ',\xa0Patrik Feßer', '\xa0&\xa0Stefan Sinzinger']}]",True,"['Phuong-Ha Cu-Nguyen', 'Adrian Grewe', 'Patrik Feßer', 'Andreas Seifert', 'Stefan Sinzinger', 'Hans Zappe']","Cu-Nguyen, P., Grewe, A., Feßer, P. et al.

original article,Pixel super-resolution using wavelength scanning,"<p>Undersampling and pixelation affect a number of imaging systems, limiting the resolution of the acquired images, which becomes particularly significant for wide-field microscopy applications. Various super-resolution techniques have been implemented to mitigate this resolution loss by utilizing sub-pixel displacements in the imaging system, achieved, for example, by shifting the illumination source, the sensor array and/or the sample, followed by digital synthesis of a smaller effective pixel by merging these sub-pixel-shifted low-resolution images. Herein, we introduce a new pixel super-resolution method that is based on wavelength scanning and demonstrate that as an alternative to physical shifting/displacements, wavelength diversity can be used to boost the resolution of a wide-field imaging system and significantly increase its space-bandwidth product. We confirmed the effectiveness of this new technique by improving the resolution of lens-free as well as lens-based microscopy systems and developed an iterative algorithm to generate high-resolution reconstructions of a specimen using undersampled diffraction patterns recorded at a few wavelengths covering a narrow spectrum (10&#8211;30&#8201;nm). When combined with a synthetic-aperture-based diffraction imaging technique, this wavelength-scanning super-resolution approach can achieve a half-pitch resolution of 250&#8201;nm, corresponding to a numerical aperture of ~1.0, across a large field of view (&gt;20&#8201;mm<sup>2</sup>). We also demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by imaging various biological samples, including blood and Papanicolaou smears. Compared with displacement-based super-resolution techniques, wavelength scanning brings uniform resolution improvement in all directions across a sensor array and requires significantly fewer measurements. This technique would broadly benefit wide-field imaging applications that demand larger space-bandwidth products.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Wei Luo', ',\xa0Yibo Zhang', ',\xa0Alborz Feizi', ',\xa0Zoltán Göröcs', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'Bioengineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Wei Luo', ',\xa0Yibo Zhang', ',\xa0Alborz Feizi', ',\xa0Zoltán Göröcs', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Wei Luo', ',\xa0Yibo Zhang', ',\xa0Alborz Feizi', ',\xa0Zoltán Göröcs', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'Department of Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Aydogan Ozcan']}]",True,"['Wei Luo', 'Yibo Zhang', 'Alborz Feizi', 'Zoltán Göröcs', 'Aydogan Ozcan']","Luo, W., Zhang, Y., Feizi, A. et al.

original article,Strongly enhanced light trapping in a two-dimensional silicon nanowire random fractal array,"<p>We report on the unconventional optical properties exhibited by a two-dimensional array of thin Si nanowires arranged in a random fractal geometry and fabricated using an inexpensive, fast and maskless process compatible with Si technology. The structure allows for a high light-trapping efficiency across the entire visible range, attaining total reflectance values as low as 0.1% when the wavelength in the medium matches the length scale of maximum heterogeneity in the system. We show that the random fractal structure of our nanowire array is responsible for a strong in-plane multiple scattering, which is related to the material refractive index fluctuations and leads to a greatly enhanced Raman scattering and a bright photoluminescence. These strong emissions are correlated on all length scales according to the refractive index fluctuations. The relevance and the perspectives of the reported results are discussed as promising for Si-based photovoltaic and photonic applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'CNR-IPCF, Istituto per i Processi Chimico Fisici, Messina, 98158, Italy', 'authors': ['Barbara Fazio', ',\xa0Maria Antonia Iatì', ',\xa0Maria Josè Lo Faro', ',\xa0Pietro Giuseppe Gucciardi', ',\xa0Cirino Salvatore Vasi', '\xa0&\xa0Alessia Irrera']}, {'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia, Università di Catania, Catania, 95123, Italy', 'authors': ['Pietro Artoni', ',\xa0Maria Josè Lo Faro', ',\xa0Paolo Musumeci', '\xa0&\xa0Francesco Priolo']}, {'address': 'CNR-MATIS IMM, Istituto per la Microelettronica e Microsistemi, Catania, 95123, Italy', 'authors': [""Cristiano D'Andrea"", ',\xa0Maria Josè Lo Faro', ',\xa0Paolo Musumeci', '\xa0&\xa0Francesco Priolo']}, {'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica, Università degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, 27100, Italy', 'authors': ['Salvatore Del Sorbo', ',\xa0Stefano Pirotta', '\xa0&\xa0Matteo Galli']}, {'address': 'Dipartimento di Scienze Matematiche e Informatiche, Scienze Fisiche e Scienze della Terra, Università di Messina, Messina, 98166, Italy', 'authors': ['Rosalba Saija']}, {'address': 'Scuola Superiore di Catania, Università di Catania, via Valdisavoia, 9, Catania, 95123, Italy', 'authors': ['Francesco Priolo']}]",True,"['Barbara Fazio', 'Pietro Artoni', 'Maria Antonia Iatì', ""Cristiano D'Andrea"", 'Maria Josè Lo Faro', 'Salvatore Del Sorbo', 'Stefano Pirotta', 'Pietro Giuseppe Gucciardi', 'Paolo Musumeci', 'Cirino Salvatore Vasi', 'Rosalba Saija', 'Matteo Galli', 'Francesco Priolo', 'Alessia Irrera']","Fazio, B., Artoni, P., Antonia Iatì, M. et al.

original article,Path-polarization hyperentangled and cluster states of photons on a chip,"<p>Encoding many qubits in different degrees of freedom (DOFs) of single photons is one of the routes toward enlarging the Hilbert space spanned by a photonic quantum state. Hyperentangled photon states (that is, states showing entanglement in multiple DOFs) have demonstrated significant implications for both fundamental physics tests and quantum communication and computation. Increasing the number of qubits of photonic experiments requires miniaturization and integration of the basic elements, and functions to guarantee the setup stability, which motivates the development of technologies allowing the precise control of different photonic DOFs on a chip. We demonstrate the contextual use of path and polarization qubits propagating within an integrated quantum circuit. We tested the properties of four-qubit linear cluster states built on both DOFs, and we exploited them to perform the Grover's search algorithm according to the one-way quantum computation model. Our results pave the way toward the full integration on a chip of hybrid multi-qubit multiphoton states.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica—Sapienza Università di Roma, Roma, I-00185, Italy', 'authors': ['Mario Arnolfo Ciampini', ',\xa0Adeline Orieux', ',\xa0Stefano Paesani', ',\xa0Fabio Sciarrino', '\xa0&\xa0Paolo Mataloni']}, {'address': 'Istituto di Fotonica e Nanotecnologie—Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IFN-CNR), Milano, I-20133, Italy', 'authors': ['Giacomo Corrielli', ',\xa0Andrea Crespi', ',\xa0Roberta Ramponi', '\xa0&\xa0Roberto Osellame']}, {'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica—Politecnico di Milano, Milano, I-20133, Italy', 'authors': ['Giacomo Corrielli', ',\xa0Andrea Crespi', ',\xa0Roberta Ramponi', '\xa0&\xa0Roberto Osellame']}]",True,"['Mario Arnolfo Ciampini', 'Adeline Orieux', 'Stefano Paesani', 'Fabio Sciarrino', 'Giacomo Corrielli', 'Andrea Crespi', 'Roberta Ramponi', 'Roberto Osellame', 'Paolo Mataloni']","Ciampini, M., Orieux, A., Paesani, S. et al.

original article,UV/VUV switch-driven color-reversal effect for Tb-activated phosphors,"<p>The remarkable narrow-band emission of trivalent lanthanide-doped phosphors excited by the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation lines of Xe atoms/Xe<sub>2</sub> molecules at 147/172&#8201;nm are extensively investigated in the development of plasma display panels and Hg-free fluorescent lamps, which are frequently used in our daily lives. Numerous solid materials, particularly Tb<sup>3+</sup>-doped oxides, such as silicates, phosphates and borates, are efficient green/blue sources with color-tunable properties. The excitation wavelength and rare earth concentration are usually varied to optimize efficiency and the luminescent properties. However, some underlying mechanisms for the shift in the emission colors remain unclear. The present study shows that a UV/VUV switch systematically controls the change in the phosphor (Ba<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>12</sub>N<sub>2</sub>:Tb) photoluminescence from green to blue, resulting in a green emission when the system is excited with UV radiation. However, a blue color is observed when the radiation wavelength shifts to the VUV region. Thus, a configurational coordinate model is proposed for the color-reversal effect. In this model, the dominant radiative decay results in a green emission under low-energy UV excitation from the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>4</sub> state of the f&#8211;f inner-shell transition in the Tb system. However, under high-energy VUV excitation, the state switches into the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>3</sub> state, which exhibits a blue emission. This mechanism is expected to be generally applicable to Tb-doped phosphors and useful in adjusting the optical properties against well-known cross-relaxation processes by varying the ratio of the green/blue contributions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Taiwan University, Taipei', 'authors': ['Chun Che Lin', ',\xa0Wei-Ting Chen', ',\xa0Cheng-I Chu', ',\xa0Kuan-Wei Huang', ',\xa0Chiao-Wen Yeh', '\xa0&\xa0Ru-Shi Liu']}, {'address': 'Synchrotron Radiation Research, Hsinchu', 'authors': ['Bing-Ming Cheng']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Taipei University of Technology, Taipei', 'authors': ['Ru-Shi Liu']}]",True,"['Chun Che Lin', 'Wei-Ting Chen', 'Cheng-I Chu', 'Kuan-Wei Huang', 'Chiao-Wen Yeh', 'Bing-Ming Cheng', 'Ru-Shi Liu']","Lin, C., Chen, W., Chu, C. et al.

original article,Two-dimensional control of light with light on metasurfaces,"<p>The ability to control the wavefront of light is fundamental to focusing and redistribution of light, enabling many applications from imaging to spectroscopy. Wave interaction on highly nonlinear photorefractive materials is essentially the only established technology allowing the dynamic control of the wavefront of a light beam with another beam of light, but it is slow and requires large optical power. Here we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of a new technology for two-dimensional (2D) control of light with light based on the coherent interaction of optical beams on highly absorbing plasmonic metasurfaces. We illustrate this by performing 2D all-optical logical operations (AND, XOR and OR) and image processing. Our approach offers diffraction-limited resolution, potentially at arbitrarily-low intensity levels and with 100&#8201;THz bandwidth, thus promising new applications in space-division multiplexing, adaptive optics, image correction, processing and recognition, 2D binary optical data processing and reconfigurable optical devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre and Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton, Highfield, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK', 'authors': ['Maria Papaioannou', ',\xa0Eric Plum', ',\xa0João Valente', ',\xa0Edward TF Rogers', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Highfield, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK', 'authors': ['Edward TF Rogers']}, {'address': 'The Photonics Institute and Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637371, Singapore', 'authors': ['Nikolay I Zheludev']}]",True,"['Maria Papaioannou', 'Eric Plum', 'João Valente', 'Edward TF Rogers', 'Nikolay I Zheludev']","Papaioannou, M., Plum, E., Valente, J. et al.
