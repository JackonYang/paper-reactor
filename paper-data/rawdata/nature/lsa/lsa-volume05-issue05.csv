original article,Optically induced transparency in a micro-cavity,"<p>Electromagnetically induced transparency has the unique ability to optically control transparency windows with low light in atomic systems. However, its practical applications in quantum physics and information science are limited due to rigid experimental requirements. Here we demonstrate a new mechanism of optically induced transparency in a micro-cavity by introducing a four-wave mixing gain to nonlinearly couple two separated resonances of the micro-cavity in an ambient environment. A signature Fano-like resonance was observed owing to the nonlinear interference of the two coupled resonances. Moreover, we show that the unidirectional gain of the four-wave mixing can lead to the remarkable effect of non-reciprocal transmission at the transparency windows. Optically induced transparency may offer a unique platform for a compact, integrated solution to all-optical and quantum information.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, The State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks and Collaborative Innovation Center of IFSA, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China', 'authors': ['Yuanlin Zheng', ',\xa0Zhenhua Shen', ',\xa0Jianjun Cao', ',\xa0Xianfeng Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Wenjie Wan']}, {'address': 'MOE Key Laboratory for Laser Plasmas, the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China', 'authors': ['Jianfan Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Wenjie Wan']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, USA', 'authors': ['Xiaogan Liang']}]",True,"['Yuanlin Zheng', 'Jianfan Yang', 'Zhenhua Shen', 'Jianjun Cao', 'Xianfeng Chen', 'Xiaogan Liang', 'Wenjie Wan']","Zheng, Y., Yang, J., Shen, Z. et al.

original article,Going beyond 1000000 resolved points in a Brillouin distributed fiber sensor: theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration,"<p>Distributed fiber sensing possesses the unique ability to measure the distributed profile of an environmental quantity along many tens of kilometers with spatial resolutions in the meter or even centimeter scale. This feature enables distributed sensors to provide a large number of resolved points using a single optical fiber. However, in current systems, this number has remained constrained to a few hundreds of thousands due to the finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the measurements, which imposes significant challenges in the development of more performing sensors. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultimately optimized distributed fiber sensor capable of resolving 2100000 independent points, which corresponds to a one-order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the state-of-the-art. Using a Brillouin distributed fiber sensor based on phase-modulation correlation-domain analysis combined with temporal gating of the pump and time-domain acquisition, a spatial resolution of 8.3&#8201;mm is demonstrated over a distance of 17.5&#8201;km. The sensor design addresses the most relevant factors impacting the SNR and the performance of medium-to-long range sensors as well as of sub-meter spatial resolution schemes. This step record in the number of resolved points could be reached due to two theoretical models proposed and experimentally validated in this study: one model describes the spatial resolution of the system and its relation with the sampling interval, and the other describes the amplitude response of the sensor, providing an accurate estimation of the SNR of the measurements.</p>",,"[{'address': 'EPFL Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Group for Fiber Optics (GFO), SCI-STI-LT, Station 11, Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Andrey Denisov', ',\xa0Marcelo A Soto', '\xa0&\xa0Luc Thévenaz']}]",True,"['Andrey Denisov', 'Marcelo A Soto', 'Luc Thévenaz']","Denisov, A., Soto, M. & Thévenaz, L.

original article,Anisotropic coding metamaterials and their powerful manipulation of differently polarized terahertz waves,"<p>Metamaterials based on effective media can be used to produce a number of unusual physical properties (for example, negative refraction and invisibility cloaking) because they can be tailored with effective medium parameters that do not occur in nature. Recently, the use of coding metamaterials has been suggested for the control of electromagnetic waves through the design of coding sequences using digital elements &#8216;0&#8217; and &#8216;1,' which possess opposite phase responses. Here we propose the concept of an anisotropic coding metamaterial in which the coding behaviors in different directions are dependent on the polarization status of the electromagnetic waves. We experimentally demonstrate an ultrathin and flexible polarization-controlled anisotropic coding metasurface that functions in the terahertz regime using specially designed coding elements. By encoding the elements with elaborately designed coding sequences (both 1-bit and 2-bit sequences), the x- and y-polarized waves can be anomalously reflected or independently diffused in three dimensions. The simulated far-field scattering patterns and near-field distributions are presented to illustrate the dual-functional performance of the encoded metasurface, and the results are consistent with the measured results. We further demonstrate the ability of the anisotropic coding metasurfaces to generate a beam splitter and realize simultaneous anomalous reflections and polarization conversions, thus providing powerful control of differently polarized electromagnetic waves. The proposed method enables versatile beam behaviors under orthogonal polarizations using a single metasurface and has the potential for use in the development of interesting terahertz devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China', 'authors': ['Shuo Liu', ',\xa0Tie Jun Cui', ',\xa0Di Bao', ',\xa0Xiang Wan', ',\xa0Wen Xuan Tang', ',\xa0Xiao Yang Zhou', ',\xa0Hui Feng Ma', ',\xa0Wei Xiang Jiang', '\xa0&\xa0Qiang Cheng']}, {'address': 'Synergetic Innovation Center of Wireless Communication Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China', 'authors': ['Shuo Liu', ',\xa0Di Bao', ',\xa0Xiang Wan', ',\xa0Wen Xuan Tang', ',\xa0Xiao Yang Zhou', ',\xa0Hui Feng Ma', '\xa0&\xa0Wei Xiang Jiang']}, {'address': 'Cooperative Innovation Centre of Terahertz Science, Chengdu, 610054, China', 'authors': ['Tie Jun Cui', ',\xa0Weili Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Qiang Cheng']}, {'address': 'Center for Terahertz Waves and College of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China', 'authors': ['Quan Xu', ',\xa0Liangliang Du', ',\xa0Chunmei Ouyang', ',\xa0Jiaguang Han', '\xa0&\xa0Weili Zhang']}, {'address': 'Jiangsu Xuantu Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, 211111, China', 'authors': ['Xiao Yang Zhou', '\xa0&\xa0Hao Yuan']}]",True,"['Shuo Liu', 'Tie Jun Cui', 'Quan Xu', 'Di Bao', 'Liangliang Du', 'Xiang Wan', 'Wen Xuan Tang', 'Chunmei Ouyang', 'Xiao Yang Zhou', 'Hao Yuan', 'Hui Feng Ma', 'Wei Xiang Jiang', 'Jiaguang Han', 'Weili Zhang', 'Qiang Cheng']","Liu, S., Cui, T., Xu, Q. et al.

original article,Nonlinear terahertz devices utilizing semiconducting plasmonic metamaterials,"<p>The development of responsive metamaterials has enabled the realization of compact tunable photonic devices capable of manipulating the amplitude, polarization, wave vector and frequency of light. Integration of semiconductors into the active regions of metallic resonators is a proven approach for creating nonlinear metamaterials through optoelectronic control of the semiconductor carrier density. Metal-free subwavelength resonant semiconductor structures offer an alternative approach to create dynamic metamaterials. We present InAs plasmonic disk arrays as a viable resonant metamaterial at terahertz frequencies. Importantly, InAs plasmonic disks exhibit a strong nonlinear response arising from electric field-induced intervalley scattering, resulting in a reduced carrier mobility thereby damping the plasmonic response. We demonstrate nonlinear perfect absorbers configured as either optical limiters or saturable absorbers, including flexible nonlinear absorbers achieved by transferring the disks to polyimide films. Nonlinear plasmonic metamaterials show potential for use in ultrafast terahertz (THz) optics and for passive protection of sensitive electromagnetic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Laboratory for Microsystems Technology, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA', 'authors': ['Huseyin R Seren', ',\xa0Xiaoguang Zhao', ',\xa0Kebin Fan', '\xa0&\xa0Xin Zhang']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA', 'authors': ['Jingdi Zhang', ',\xa0George R Keiser', '\xa0&\xa0Richard D Averitt']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA', 'authors': ['Jingdi Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Richard D Averitt']}, {'address': 'School of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA', 'authors': ['George R Keiser']}, {'address': 'Microelectronics Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78758, USA', 'authors': ['Scott J Maddox', '\xa0&\xa0Seth R Bank']}]",True,"['Huseyin R Seren', 'Jingdi Zhang', 'George R Keiser', 'Scott J Maddox', 'Xiaoguang Zhao', 'Kebin Fan', 'Seth R Bank', 'Xin Zhang', 'Richard D Averitt']","Seren, H., Zhang, J., Keiser, G. et al.

original article,Optical tracking of picosecond coherent phonon pulse focusing inside a sub-micron object,"<p>By means of an ultrafast optical technique, we track focused gigahertz coherent phonon pulses in objects down to sub-micron in size. Infrared light pulses illuminating the surface of a single metal-coated silica fibre generate longitudinal-phonon wave packets. Reflection of visible probe light pulses from the fibre surface allows the vibrational modes of the fibre to be detected, and Brillouin optical scattering of partially transmitted light pulses allows the acoustic wavefronts inside the transparent fibre to be continuously monitored. We thereby probe acoustic focusing in the time domain resulting from generation at the curved fibre surface. An analytical model, supported by three-dimensional simulations, suggests that we have followed the focusing of the acoustic beam down to a ~150-nm diameter waist inside the fibre. This work significantly narrows the lateral resolution for focusing of picosecond acoustic pulses, normally limited by the diffraction limit of focused optical pulses to ~1&#8201;&#956;m, and thereby opens up a new range of possibilities including nanoscale acoustic microscopy and nanoscale computed tomography.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut Lumière Matière, UMR5306, Université Lyon 1-CNRS, Université de Lyon, Villeurbanne, 69622, France', 'authors': ['Thomas Dehoux']}, {'address': 'Division of Applied Physics, Faculty of Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-8628, Japan', 'authors': ['Kenichi Ishikawa', ',\xa0Paul H Otsuka', ',\xa0Motonobu Tomoda', ',\xa0Osamu Matsuda', '\xa0&\xa0Oliver B Wright']}, {'address': 'Research Institute for Electronic Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 001-0020, Japan', 'authors': ['Masazumi Fujiwara', '\xa0&\xa0Shigeki Takeuchi']}, {'address': 'School of Science and Technology, Kwansei Gakuin University, Sanda, 669-1337, Hyogo, Japan', 'authors': ['Masazumi Fujiwara']}, {'address': 'Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan', 'authors': ['Shigeki Takeuchi']}, {'address': 'Research Centre for Non-Destructive Testing GmbH, Altenberger Strasse 69, Linz, A-4040, Austria', 'authors': ['Istvan A Veres']}, {'address': ""Laboratoire d'Acoustique de l'Université, du Maine, Le Mans, 72085, France"", 'authors': ['Vitalyi E Gusev']}]",True,"['Thomas Dehoux', 'Kenichi Ishikawa', 'Paul H Otsuka', 'Motonobu Tomoda', 'Osamu Matsuda', 'Masazumi Fujiwara', 'Shigeki Takeuchi', 'Istvan A Veres', 'Vitalyi E Gusev', 'Oliver B Wright']","Dehoux, T., Ishikawa, K., Otsuka, P. et al.

original article,Spatio-temporal visualization of light transport in complex photonic structures,"<p>Spatio-temporal imaging of light propagation is very important in photonics because it provides the most direct tool available to study the interaction between light and its host environment. Sub-ps time resolution is needed to investigate the fine and complex structural features that characterize disordered and heterogeneous structures, which are responsible for a rich array of transport physics that have not yet been fully explored. A newly developed wide-field imaging system enables us to present a spatio-temporal study on light transport in various disordered media, revealing properties that could not be properly assessed using standard techniques. By extending our investigation to an almost transparent membrane, a configuration that has been difficult to characterize until now, we unveil the peculiar physics exhibited by such thin scattering systems with transport features that go beyond mainstream diffusion modeling, despite the occurrence of multiple scattering.</p>",,"[{'address': 'European Laboratory for Non-linear Spectroscopy (LENS), Università di Firenze, Sesto Fiorentino (FI), 50019, Italy', 'authors': ['Lorenzo Pattelli', ',\xa0Romolo Savo', '\xa0&\xa0Diederik S Wiersma']}, {'address': 'Istituto Nazionale di Ottica (CNR-INO), Firenze (FI), 50125, Italy', 'authors': ['Matteo Burresi']}, {'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia, Università di Firenze, Sesto Fiorentino (FI), 50019, Italy', 'authors': ['Diederik S Wiersma']}]",True,"['Lorenzo Pattelli', 'Romolo Savo', 'Matteo Burresi', 'Diederik S Wiersma']","Pattelli, L., Savo, R., Burresi, M. et al.
