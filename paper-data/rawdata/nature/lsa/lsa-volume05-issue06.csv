review,Metallic nanostructures for efficient LED lighting,"<p>Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are driving a shift toward energy-efficient illumination. Nonetheless, modifying the emission intensities, colors and directionalities of LEDs in specific ways remains a challenge often tackled by incorporating secondary optical components. Metallic nanostructures supporting plasmonic resonances are an interesting alternative to this approach due to their strong light&#8211;matter interaction, which facilitates control over light emission without requiring external secondary optical components. This review discusses new methods that enhance the efficiencies of LEDs using nanostructured metals. This is an emerging field that incorporates physics, materials science, device technology and industry. First, we provide a general overview of state-of-the-art LED lighting, discussing the main characteristics required of both quantum wells and color converters to efficiently generate white light. Then, we discuss the main challenges in this field as well as the potential of metallic nanostructures to circumvent them. We review several of the most relevant demonstrations of LEDs in combination with metallic nanostructures, which have resulted in light-emitting devices with improved performance. We also highlight a few recent studies in applied plasmonics that, although exploratory and eminently fundamental, may lead to new solutions in illumination.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Sevilla, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas-Universidad de Sevilla (CSIC-US), Sevilla, 41092, Spain', 'authors': ['Gabriel Lozano']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire de Photonique et de Nanostructures (LPN), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), 91460 Marcoussis, France', 'authors': ['Said RK Rodriguez']}, {'address': 'Philips Research Laboratories, 5656AE Eindhoven, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Marc A Verschuuren']}, {'address': 'Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research, Eindhoven, 5600 HH, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Jaime Gómez Rivas']}, {'address': 'COBRA Research Institute, Technical University of Eindhoven, Eindhoven, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Jaime Gómez Rivas']}]",True,"['Gabriel Lozano', 'Said RK Rodriguez', 'Marc A Verschuuren', 'Jaime Gómez Rivas']","Lozano, G., Rodriguez, S., Verschuuren, M. et al.

original article,Long-term in vivo single-cell lineage tracing of deep structures using three-photon activation,"<p>Genetic labeling techniques allow for noninvasive lineage tracing of cells in vivo. Two-photon inducible activators provide spatial resolution for superficial cells, but labeling cells located deep within tissues is precluded by scattering of the far-red illumination required for two-photon photolysis. Three-photon illumination has been shown to overcome the limitations of two-photon microscopy for in vivo imaging of deep structures, but whether it can be used for photoactivation remains to be tested. Here we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that three-photon illumination overcomes scattering problems by combining longer wavelength excitation with high uncaging three-photon cross-section molecules. We prospectively labeled heart muscle cells in zebrafish embryos and found permanent labeling in their progeny in adult animals with negligible tissue damage. This technique allows for a noninvasive genetic manipulation in vivo with spatial, temporal and cell-type specificity, and may have wide applicability in experimental biology.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona, 08003, Spain', 'authors': ['Isil Tekeli', '\xa0&\xa0Angel Raya']}, {'address': 'Control of Stem Cell Potency Group, Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), Barcelona Science Park, Baldiri Reixac 15-21, Barcelona, 08028, Spain', 'authors': ['Isil Tekeli', '\xa0&\xa0Angel Raya']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, École Normale Supérieure—PSL Research University, 24 rue Lhomond, Paris, F-75005, France', 'authors': ['Isabelle Aujard', '\xa0&\xa0Ludovic Jullien']}, {'address': 'Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ Paris 06, PASTEUR, Paris, F-75005, France', 'authors': ['Isabelle Aujard', '\xa0&\xa0Ludovic Jullien']}, {'address': 'CNRS, UMR 8640 PASTEUR, Paris, F-75005, France', 'authors': ['Isabelle Aujard', '\xa0&\xa0Ludovic Jullien']}, {'address': 'Integrative Cell and Tissue Dynamics Group, Institute of Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), Barcelona, 08028, Spain', 'authors': ['Xavier Trepat', '\xa0&\xa0Dobryna Zalvidea']}, {'address': 'Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), Barcelona, 08010, Spain', 'authors': ['Xavier Trepat', '\xa0&\xa0Angel Raya']}, {'address': 'Center for Networked Biomedical Research on Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), Madrid, 28029, Spain', 'authors': ['Xavier Trepat', '\xa0&\xa0Angel Raya']}]",True,"['Isil Tekeli', 'Isabelle Aujard', 'Xavier Trepat', 'Ludovic Jullien', 'Angel Raya', 'Dobryna Zalvidea']","Tekeli, I., Aujard, I., Trepat, X. et al.

original article,Pulse generation with ultra-superluminal pulse propagation in semiconductor heterostructures by superradiant-phase transition enhanced by transient coherent population gratings,"<p>This paper reports the observation of ultra-superluminal pulse propagation in multiple-contact semiconductor heterostructures in a superradiant emission regime, and shows definitively that it is a different class of emission from conventional spontaneous or stimulated emission. Coherent population gratings induced in the semiconductor medium under strong electrical pumping have been shown to cause a major decrease of the group refractive index, in the range of 5&#8211;40%. This decrease is much greater than that caused by conventional carrier depletion or chirp mechanisms. The decrease in refractive index in turn causes faster-than-c propagation of femtosecond pulses. The measurement also proves the existence of coherent amplification of electromagnetic pulses in semiconductors at room temperature, the coherence being strongly enhanced by interactions of the light with coherent transient gratings locked to carrier gratings. This pulse-generation technique is anticipated to have great potential in applications where highly coherent femtosecond optical pulses must be generated on demand.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Engineering, Centre for Photonic Systems, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0FA, UK', 'authors': [""Peter P Vasil'ev"", ',\xa0Richard V Penty', '\xa0&\xa0Ian H White']}, {'address': 'Quantum Electronics Division, PN Lebedev Physical Institute, Moscow, 119991, Russia', 'authors': [""Peter P Vasil'ev""]}]",True,"[""Peter P Vasil'ev"", 'Richard V Penty', 'Ian H White']","Vasil'ev, P., Penty, R. & White, I.

original article,Chaotic light at mid-infrared wavelength,"<p>The onset of nonlinear dynamics and chaos is evidenced in a mid-infrared distributed feedback quantum cascade laser both in the temporal and frequency domains. As opposed to the commonly observed route to chaos in semiconductor lasers, which involves undamping of the laser relaxation oscillations, quantum cascade lasers first exhibit regular self-pulsation at the external cavity frequency before entering into a chaotic low-frequency fluctuation regime. The bifurcation sequence, similar to that already observed in class A gas lasers under optical feedback, results from the fast carrier relaxation dynamics occurring in quantum cascade lasers, as confirmed by numerical simulations. Such chaotic behavior can impact various practical applications including spectroscopy, which requires stable single-mode operation. It also allows the development of novel mid-infrared high-power chaotic light sources, thus enabling secure free-space high bit-rate optical communications based on chaos synchronization.</p>",,"[{'address': 'CNRS LTCI, Télécom ParisTech, Université Paris Saclay, Paris Cedex 13, 75634, France', 'authors': ['Louise Jumpertz', ',\xa0Kevin Schires', '\xa0&\xa0Frédéric Grillot']}, {'address': 'mirSense, 86 rue de Paris, bat.

original article,Mirror-enhanced super-resolution microscopy,"<p>Axial excitation confinement beyond the diffraction limit is crucial to the development of next-generation, super-resolution microscopy. STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy offers lateral super-resolution using a donut-beam depletion, but its axial resolution is still over 500&#8201;nm. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is widely used for single-molecule localization, but its ability to detect molecules is limited to within the evanescent field of ~100&#8201;nm from the cell attachment surface. We find here that the axial thickness of the point spread function (PSF) during confocal excitation can be easily improved to 110&#8201;nm by replacing the microscopy slide with a mirror. The interference of the local electromagnetic field confined the confocal PSF to a 110-nm spot axially, which enables axial super-resolution with all laser-scanning microscopes. Axial sectioning can be obtained with wavelength modulation or by controlling the spacer between the mirror and the specimen. With no additional complexity, the mirror-assisted excitation confinement enhanced the axial resolution six-fold and the lateral resolution two-fold for STED, which together achieved 19-nm resolution to resolve the inner rim of a nuclear pore complex and to discriminate the contents of 120&#8201;nm viral filaments. The ability to increase the lateral resolution and decrease the thickness of an axial section using mirror-enhanced STED without increasing the laser power is of great importance for imaging biological specimens, which cannot tolerate high laser power.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Peking University, No. 5 Yiheyuan Road, Beijing, 100871, China', 'authors': ['Xusan Yang', ',\xa0Hao Xie', ',\xa0Yujia Liu', ',\xa0Xuanze Chen', ',\xa0Qiushi Ren', '\xa0&\xa0Peng Xi']}, {'address': 'Wallace H Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, Atlanta, 30332, GA, USA', 'authors': ['Hao Xie', ',\xa0Eric Alonas', ',\xa0Philip J Santangelo', '\xa0&\xa0Peng Xi']}, {'address': 'Advanced Cytometry Labs, ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP), Macquarie University, Sydney, 2109, NSW, Australia', 'authors': ['Yujia Liu', ',\xa0Peng Xi', '\xa0&\xa0Dayong Jin']}, {'address': 'Institute for Biomedical Materials and Devices (IBMD), Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, 2007, NSW, Australia', 'authors': ['Peng Xi', '\xa0&\xa0Dayong Jin']}]",True,"['Xusan Yang', 'Hao Xie', 'Eric Alonas', 'Yujia Liu', 'Xuanze Chen', 'Philip J Santangelo', 'Qiushi Ren', 'Peng Xi', 'Dayong Jin']","Yang, X., Xie, H., Alonas, E. et al.
