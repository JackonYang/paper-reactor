original article,"The engineered eyeball, a tunable imaging system using soft-matter micro-optics","<p>We demonstrate a tunable imaging system based on the functionality of the mammalian eye using soft-matter micro-optical components. Inspired by the structure of the eye, as well as by the means through which nature tunes its optical behavior, we show that the technologies of microsystems engineering and micro-optics may be used to realize a technical imaging system whose biomimetic functionality is entirely distinct from that of conventional optics. The engineered eyeball integrates a deformable elastomeric refractive structure whose shape is mechanically controlled through application of strain using liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators; two forms of tunable iris, one based on optofluidics and the other on LCEs with embedded heaters; a fixed lens arrangement; and a commercial imaging sensor chip. The complete microsystem, optimized to yield optical characteristics close to those of the human eye, represents the first fully functional, soft-matter-based tunable single-aperture eye-like imager.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Microsystems Engineering, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, 79110, Germany', 'authors': ['Sebastian Petsch', ',\xa0Stefan Schuhladen', ',\xa0Lucas Dreesen', '\xa0&\xa0Hans Zappe']}]",True,"['Sebastian Petsch', 'Stefan Schuhladen', 'Lucas Dreesen', 'Hans Zappe']","Petsch, S., Schuhladen, S., Dreesen, L. et al.

original article,Unraveling the optomechanical nature of plasmonic trapping,"<p>Noninvasive and ultra-accurate optical manipulation of nanometer objects has recently gained interest as a powerful tool in nanotechnology and biophysics. Self-induced back-action (SIBA) trapping in nano-optical cavities has the unique potential for trapping and manipulating nanometer-sized objects under low optical intensities. However, thus far, the existence of the SIBA effect has been shown only indirectly via its enhanced trapping performances. In this article, we present the first time direct experimental evidence of the self-reconfiguration of the optical potential that is experienced by a nanoparticle trapped in a plasmonic nanocavity. Our observations enable us to gain further understanding of the SIBA mechanism and to determine the optimal conditions for boosting the performances of SIBA-based nano-optical tweezers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, 08860, Spain', 'authors': ['Pau Mestres', ',\xa0Johann Berthelot', ',\xa0Srdjan S Aćimović', '\xa0&\xa0Romain Quidant']}, {'address': 'ICREA-Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, Barcelona, 08010, Spain', 'authors': ['Romain Quidant']}]",True,"['Pau Mestres', 'Johann Berthelot', 'Srdjan S Aćimović', 'Romain Quidant']","Mestres, P., Berthelot, J., Aćimović, S. et al.

original article,Controllable optical activity with non-chiral plasmonic metasurfaces,"<p>Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light along the propagation direction as the light travels through optically active materials. In existing methods, the strength of the optical activity is determined by the chirality of the materials, which is difficult to control quantitatively. Here we numerically and experimentally investigated an alternative approach to realize and control the optical activity with non-chiral plasmonic metasurfaces. Through judicious design of the structural units of the metasurfaces, the right and left circular polarization components of the linearly polarized light have different phase retardations after transmitting through the metasurfaces, leading to large optical activity. Moreover, the strength of the optical activity can be easily and accurately tuned by directly adjusting the phase difference. The proposed approach based on non-chiral plasmonic metasurfaces exhibits large optical activity with a high controllable degree of freedom, which may provide more possibilities for applications in photonics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'The MOE Key Laboratory of Weak Light Nonlinear Photonics, School of Physics, Teda Applied Physics Institute, and the 2011 Project Collaborative Innovation Center for Biological Therapy, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China', 'authors': ['Ping Yu', ',\xa0Jianxiong Li', ',\xa0Hua Cheng', ',\xa0Zhaocheng Liu', ',\xa0Zhancheng Li', ',\xa0Shuqi Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Jianguo Tian']}, {'address': 'Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100190, China', 'authors': ['Chengchun Tang', ',\xa0Zhe Liu', ',\xa0Changzhi Gu', '\xa0&\xa0Junjie Li']}]",True,"['Ping Yu', 'Jianxiong Li', 'Chengchun Tang', 'Hua Cheng', 'Zhaocheng Liu', 'Zhancheng Li', 'Zhe Liu', 'Changzhi Gu', 'Junjie Li', 'Shuqi Chen', 'Jianguo Tian']","Yu, P., Li, J., Tang, C. et al.

original article,Supra-(carbon nanodots) with a strong visible to near-infrared absorption band and efficient photothermal conversion,"<p>A novel concept and approach to engineering carbon nanodots (CNDs) were explored to overcome the limited light absorption of CNDs in low-energy spectral regions. In this work, we constructed a novel type of supra-CND by the assembly of surface charge-confined CNDs through possible electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding.

original article,Adjustable white-light emission from a photo-structured micro-OLED array,"<p>White organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising candidates for future solid-state lighting applications and backplane illumination in large-area displays. One very specific feature of OLEDs, which is currently gaining momentum, is that they can enable tunable white light emission. This feature is conventionally realized either through the vertical stacking of independent OLEDs emitting different colors or in lateral arrangement of OLEDs. The vertical design is optically difficult to optimize and often results in efficiency compromises between the units. In contrast, the lateral concept introduces severe area losses to dark regions between the subunits, which requires a significantly larger overall device area to achieve equal brightness. Here we demonstrate a color-tunable, two-color OLED device realized by side-by-side alignment of yellow and blue p-i-n OLEDs structured down to 20&#8201;&#956;m by a simple and up-scalable orthogonal photolithography technique. This layout eliminates the problems of conventional lateral approaches by utilizing all area for light emission. The corresponding emission of the photo-patterned two-unit OLED can be tuned over a wide range from yellow to white to blue colors. The independent control of the different units allows the desired overall spectrum to be set at any given brightness level. Operated as a white light source, the microstructured OLED reaches a luminous efficacy of 13&#8201;lm&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 1000&#8201;cd&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;</sup><sup>2</sup> without an additional light outcoupling enhancement and reaches a color rendering index of 68 when operated near the color point E. Finally, we demonstrate an improved device lifetime by means of size variation of the subunits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Dresden Integrated Center for Applied Physics and Photonic Materials (IAPP) and Institute for Applied Physics, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, 01062, Germany', 'authors': ['Simonas Krotkus', ',\xa0Daniel Kasemann', ',\xa0Simone Lenk', ',\xa0Karl Leo', '\xa0&\xa0Sebastian Reineke']}]",True,"['Simonas Krotkus', 'Daniel Kasemann', 'Simone Lenk', 'Karl Leo', 'Sebastian Reineke']","Krotkus, S., Kasemann, D., Lenk, S. et al.

original article,New function of the Yb3+ ion as an efficient emitter of persistent luminescence in the short-wave infrared,"<p>The trivalent ytterbium (Yb<sup>3+</sup>) ion has been extensively used as an emitter in short-wave infrared (SWIR) lasers, a sensitizer to activate other lanthanide ions for up-conversion luminescence, and a spectral converter in Ln<sup>3+</sup>-Yb<sup>3+</sup> doubly doped quantum cutting phosphors. Here we report a new function of the Yb<sup>3+</sup> ion&#8212;as an efficient emitting center for SWIR persistent luminescence. We have developed the first real SWIR persistent phosphor, MgGeO<sub>3</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>, which exhibits very-long persistent luminescence at around 1000&#8201;nm for longer than 100&#8201;h. The MgGeO<sub>3</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup> phosphor is spectrally transparent to visible/near-infrared light (~400&#8211;900&#8201;nm) and is a promising ultraviolet-to-SWIR spectral convertor. The MgGeO<sub>3</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup> phosphor also exhibits a photostimulated persistent luminescence capability, where the SWIR persistent emission in an ultraviolet-light pre-irradiated sample can be rejuvenated by low-energy light (white or red light) stimulation. The MgGeO<sub>3</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup> phosphor is expected to have promising applications in biomedical imaging, night-vision surveillance and photovoltaics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'College of Engineering, University of Georgia, Athens, 30602, GA, USA', 'authors': ['Yan-Jie Liang', ',\xa0Feng Liu', ',\xa0Ya-Fei Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Zhengwei Pan']}, {'address': 'Key Laboratory for Liquid-Solid Structure Evolution and Processing of Materials, Shandong University, Jinan, 250061, China', 'authors': ['Yan-Jie Liang', ',\xa0Ya-Fei Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Kang-Ning Sun']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Georgia, Athens, 30602, GA, USA', 'authors': ['Feng Liu', '\xa0&\xa0Zhengwei Pan']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, 30460, GA, USA', 'authors': ['Xiao-Jun Wang']}]",True,"['Yan-Jie Liang', 'Feng Liu', 'Ya-Fei Chen', 'Xiao-Jun Wang', 'Kang-Ning Sun', 'Zhengwei Pan']","Liang, Y., Liu, F., Chen, Y. et al.

original article,"Broadband, sensitive and spectrally distinctive SnS2 nanosheet/PbS colloidal quantum dot hybrid photodetector","<p>Photodetectors convert photons into current or voltage outputs and are thus widely used for spectroscopy, imaging and sensing. Traditional photodetectors generally show a consistent-polarity response to incident photons within their broadband responsive spectrum. Here we introduced a new type of photodetector employing SnS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets sensitized with PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) that are not only sensitive (~10<sup>5</sup>&#8201;A&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and broadband (300&#8211;1000&#8201;nm) but also spectrally distinctive, that is, show distinctive (positive or negative) photoresponse toward incident photons of different wavelengths. A careful mechanism study revealed illumination-modulated Schottky contacts between SnS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets and Au electrodes, altering the photoresponse polarity toward incident photons of different wavelengths. Finally, we applied our SnS<sub>2</sub> nanosheet/PbS CQDs hybrid photodetector to differentiate the color temperature of emission from a series of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), showcasing the unique application of our novel photodetectors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO) and School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, 430074, China', 'authors': ['Liang Gao', ',\xa0Chao Chen', ',\xa0Kai Zeng', ',\xa0Cong Ge', ',\xa0Dun Yang', ',\xa0Haisheng Song', '\xa0&\xa0Jiang Tang']}]",True,"['Liang Gao', 'Chao Chen', 'Kai Zeng', 'Cong Ge', 'Dun Yang', 'Haisheng Song', 'Jiang Tang']","Gao, L., Chen, C., Zeng, K. et al.
