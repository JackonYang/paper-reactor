original article,Pseudospin-induced chirality with staggered optical graphene,"<p>Pseudospin has an important role in understanding many interesting physical phenomena that are associated with two-dimensional materials such as graphene. Pseudospin has been proposed to be directly related to angular momentum, and orbital angular momentum was recently experimentally demonstrated to be an intrinsic property of pseudospin in a photonic honeycomb lattice. However, in photonics, the interaction between spin and pseudospin for light has not been investigated. In this letter, we propose that in an optical analog of staggered graphene (that is, a photonic honeycomb lattice waveguide with in-plane inversion symmetry breaking), the pseudospin mode can strongly couple to the spin of an optical beam that is incident in certain directions. The spin&#8211;pseudospin coupling that is caused by the spin&#8211;orbit conversion in the scattering process induces a strong optical chiral effect for the transmitted optical beam. Spin&#8211;pseudospin coupling of light opens the door to the design of pseudospin-mediated spin or valley-selective photonic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK', 'authors': ['Jian-Long Liu', ',\xa0Wei-Min Ye', '\xa0&\xa0Shuang Zhang']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, 150001, China', 'authors': ['Jian-Long Liu']}, {'address': 'College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073, China', 'authors': ['Wei-Min Ye']}]",True,"['Jian-Long Liu', 'Wei-Min Ye', 'Shuang Zhang']","Liu, J., Ye, W. & Zhang, S.

original article,Quantum super-oscillation of a single photon,"<p>Super-oscillation is a counterintuitive phenomenon describing localized fast variations of functions and fields that happen at frequencies higher than the highest Fourier component of their spectra. The physical implications of this effect have been studied in information theory and optics of classical fields, and have been used in super-resolution imaging. As a general phenomenon of wave dynamics, super-oscillations have also been predicted to exist in quantum wavefunctions. Here we report the experimental demonstration of super-oscillatory behavior of a single-quantum object, a photon. The super-oscillatory behavior is demonstrated by tight localization of the photon wavefunction after focusing with an appropriately designed slit mask to create an interference pattern with a sub-diffraction hotspot (~0.45&#8201;&#955;). Such quantum super-oscillation can be used for low-intensity far-field super-resolution imaging techniques even down to single-photon counting regime, which would be of interest to quantum physics and non-invasive and label-free biological studies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'The Photonics Institute, Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637371, Singapore', 'authors': ['Guang Hui Yuan', ',\xa0Stefano Vezzoli', ',\xa0Charles Altuzarra', ',\xa0Christophe Couteau', ',\xa0Cesare Soci', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'CINTRA, CNRS-NTU-Thales, CNRS UMI 3288, Singapore, 637553, Singapore', 'authors': ['Charles Altuzarra', '\xa0&\xa0Christophe Couteau']}, {'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre and Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK', 'authors': ['Edward TF Rogers', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK', 'authors': ['Edward TF Rogers']}, {'address': 'Laboratory for Nanotechnology, Instrumentation and Optics, ICD CNRS UMR 6281, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes 10000, France', 'authors': ['Christophe Couteau']}]",True,"['Guang Hui Yuan', 'Stefano Vezzoli', 'Charles Altuzarra', 'Edward TF Rogers', 'Christophe Couteau', 'Cesare Soci', 'Nikolay I Zheludev']","Yuan, G., Vezzoli, S., Altuzarra, C. et al.

original article,Atomically phase-matched second-harmonic generation in a 2D crystal,"<p>Second-harmonic generation (SHG) has found extensive applications from hand-held laser pointers to spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Recently, some cleavable van der Waals (vdW) crystals have shown SHG arising from a single atomic layer, where the SH light elucidated important information such as the grain boundaries and electronic structure in these ultra-thin materials. However, despite the inversion asymmetry of the single layer, the typical crystal stacking restores inversion symmetry for even numbers of layers leading to an oscillatory SH response, drastically reducing the applicability of vdW crystals such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>). Here, we probe the SHG generated from the noncentrosymmetric 3R crystal phase of MoS<sub>2</sub>. We experimentally observed quadratic dependence of second-harmonic intensity on layer number as a result of atomically phase-matched nonlinear dipoles in layers of the 3R crystal that constructively interfere. By studying the layer evolution of the A and B excitonic transitions in 3R-MoS<sub>2</sub> using SHG spectroscopy, we also found distinct electronic structure differences arising from the crystal structure and the dramatic effect of symmetry and layer stacking on the nonlinear properties of these atomic crystals. The constructive nature of the SHG in this 2D crystal provides a platform to reliably develop atomically flat and controllably thin nonlinear media.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Mervin Zhao', ',\xa0Ziliang Ye', ',\xa0Yu Ye', ',\xa0Hanyu Zhu', ',\xa0Jun Xiao', ',\xa0Yuan Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Xiang Zhang']}, {'address': 'Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Mervin Zhao', ',\xa0Ziliang Ye', ',\xa0Yu Ye', ',\xa0Yuan Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Xiang Zhang']}, {'address': 'Quantum-Phase Electronics Center (QPEC) and Department of Applied Physics, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan', 'authors': ['Ryuji Suzuki', '\xa0&\xa0Yoshihiro Iwasa']}, {'address': 'RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), Wako, 351-0198, Japan', 'authors': ['Ryuji Suzuki', '\xa0&\xa0Yoshihiro Iwasa']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 21589, Saudi Arabia', 'authors': ['Xiang Zhang']}]",True,"['Mervin Zhao', 'Ziliang Ye', 'Ryuji Suzuki', 'Yu Ye', 'Hanyu Zhu', 'Jun Xiao', 'Yuan Wang', 'Yoshihiro Iwasa', 'Xiang Zhang']","Zhao, M., Ye, Z., Suzuki, R. et al.

The HFM shows upconversion luminescence (UCL), flexibility, superhydrophobicity and processability. The UCL membrane can be used as a fluorescence sensor to detect bioinformation from a single water droplet (~10&#8201;&#956;l). Based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer, the detection limits of this sensor can reach 1 and 10&#8201;ppb for the biomolecule, avidin, and the dye molecule, Rhodamine B, respectively, which are superior to most of the fluorescence sensors reported in previous works. After the fluorescence detection, the target droplet was easily removed without residues on the UCL membrane surface due to its superhydrophobic property, which exhibits an excellent recyclability that cannot be achieved by traditional liquid-based detection systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Key Laboratory of New Energy and Rare Earth Resource Utilization of State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Dalian Nationalities University, 18 Liaohe West Road, Dalian, 116600, China', 'authors': ['Kui-Chao Liu', ',\xa0Zhen-Yi Zhang', ',\xa0Zhi-Qing Feng', ',\xa0Jia-Su Li', ',\xa0Chun-Lei Song', ',\xa0Ya-Nan Bao', ',\xa0Xiao-Hui Qi', '\xa0&\xa0Bin Dong']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Luminescence and Applications, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, 130033, China', 'authors': ['Chong-Xin Shan']}, {'address': 'School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China', 'authors': ['Chong-Xin Shan']}]",True,"['Kui-Chao Liu', 'Zhen-Yi Zhang', 'Chong-Xin Shan', 'Zhi-Qing Feng', 'Jia-Su Li', 'Chun-Lei Song', 'Ya-Nan Bao', 'Xiao-Hui Qi', 'Bin Dong']","Liu, K., Zhang, Z., Shan, C. et al.A flexible and superhydrophobic upconversion-luminescence membrane as an ultrasensitive fluorescence sensor for single droplet detection.

original article,Extremely high-efficiency and ultrasimplified hybrid white organic light-emitting diodes exploiting double multifunctional blue emitting layers,"<p>Numerous hybrid white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) have recently been developed. However, their efficiency is not comparable to that of their best all-phosphorescent WOLED counterparts, and the structures are usually complicated, restricting their further development. Herein, a novel concept is used to achieve a hybrid WOLED, whose crucial feature is the exploitation of double multifunctional blue emitting layers. The three-organic-layer WOLED exhibits a total efficiency of 89.3 and 65.1&#8201;lm&#8201;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup> at 100 and 1000&#8201;cd&#8201;m<sup>&#8211;2</sup>, respectively, making it the most efficient hybrid WOLED reported in the literature so far. Significantly, the efficiencies of hybrid WOLEDs have, for the first time, been demonstrated to be comparable to those of the best all-phosphorescent WOLEDs. In addition, the device exhibits the lowest voltages among hybrid WOLEDs (i.e., 2.4, 2.7 and 3.1&#8201;V for 1, 100 and 1000&#8201;cd&#8201;m<sup>&#8211;2</sup>, respectively). Such remarkable performance achieved from such an ultrasimplified structure opens a new path toward low-cost commercialization.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510640, China', 'authors': ['Bai-Quan Liu', ',\xa0Lei Wang', ',\xa0Jian-Hua Zou', ',\xa0Hong-Long Ning', ',\xa0Jun-Biao Peng', '\xa0&\xa0Yong Cao']}, {'address': 'New Vision Opto-Electronic Technology Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, 510530, China', 'authors': ['Dong-Yu Gao']}]",True,"['Bai-Quan Liu', 'Lei Wang', 'Dong-Yu Gao', 'Jian-Hua Zou', 'Hong-Long Ning', 'Jun-Biao Peng', 'Yong Cao']","Liu, B., Wang, L., Gao, D. et al.

review,Ultrafast laser processing of materials: from science to industry,"<p>Processing of materials by ultrashort laser pulses has evolved significantly over the last decade and is starting to reveal its scientific, technological and industrial potential. In ultrafast laser manufacturing, optical energy of tightly focused femtosecond or picosecond laser pulses can be delivered to precisely defined positions in the bulk of materials via two-/multi-photon excitation on a timescale much faster than thermal energy exchange between photoexcited electrons and lattice ions. Control of photo-ionization and thermal processes with the highest precision, inducing local photomodification in sub-100-nm-sized regions has been achieved. State-of-the-art ultrashort laser processing techniques exploit high 0.1&#8211;1&#8201;&#956;m spatial resolution and almost unrestricted three-dimensional structuring capability. Adjustable pulse duration, spatiotemporal chirp, phase front tilt and polarization allow control of photomodification via uniquely wide parameter space. Mature opto-electrical/mechanical technologies have enabled laser processing speeds approaching meters-per-second, leading to a fast lab-to-fab transfer. The key aspects and latest achievements are reviewed with an emphasis on the fundamental relation between spatial resolution and total fabrication throughput. Emerging biomedical applications implementing micrometer feature precision over centimeter-scale scaffolds and photonic wire bonding in telecommunications are highlighted.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Quantum Electronics, Laser Research Centre, Physics Faculty, Vilnius University, Saulėtekio Ave. 10, Vilnius, LT-10223, Lithuania', 'authors': ['Mangirdas Malinauskas', '\xa0&\xa0Albertas Žukauskas']}, {'address': 'Center for Optical Research and Education (CORE), Utsunomiya University, 7-1-2 Yoto, Utsunomiya, 321-8585, Japan', 'authors': ['Satoshi Hasegawa', '\xa0&\xa0Yoshio Hayasaki']}, {'address': 'Research Institute of Electronics, Shizuoka University, 3-5-3-1 Johoku, Naka-ku, Hamamatsu, 432-8561, Japan', 'authors': ['Vygantas Mizeikis']}, {'address': 'Centre for Micro-Photonics, Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, 3122, VIC, Australia', 'authors': ['Ričardas Buividas', '\xa0&\xa0Saulius Juodkazis']}, {'address': 'Melbourne Centre for Nanofabrication, ANFF, 151 Wellington Road, Clayton, 3168, VIC, Australia', 'authors': ['Saulius Juodkazis']}, {'address': 'Center of Nanotechnology, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, 21589, Saudi Arabia', 'authors': ['Saulius Juodkazis']}]",True,"['Mangirdas Malinauskas', 'Albertas Žukauskas', 'Satoshi Hasegawa', 'Yoshio Hayasaki', 'Vygantas Mizeikis', 'Ričardas Buividas', 'Saulius Juodkazis']","Malinauskas, M., Žukauskas, A., Hasegawa, S. et al.
