original article,Quasi noise-free digital holography,"<p>One of the main drawbacks of Digital Holography (DH) is the coherent nature of the light source, which severely corrupts the quality of holographic reconstructions. Although numerous techniques to reduce noise in DH have provided good results, holographic noise suppression remains a challenging task. We propose a novel framework that combines the concepts of encoding multiple uncorrelated digital holograms, block grouping and collaborative filtering to achieve quasi noise-free DH reconstructions. The optimized joint action of these different image-denoising methods permits the removal of up to 98% of the noise while preserving the image contrast. The resulting quality of the hologram reconstructions is comparable to the quality achievable with non-coherent techniques and far beyond the current state of art in DH. Experimental validation is provided for both single-wavelength and multi-wavelength DH, and a comparison with the most used holographic denoising methods is performed.</p>",[],True,"[""Vittorio Bianco"", ""Pasquale Memmolo"", ""Melania Paturzo"", ""Andrea Finizio"", ""Bahram Javidi"", ""Pietro Ferraro""]","Bianco, V., Memmolo, P., Paturzo, M. et al.

original article,Experimental quantum secure direct communication with single photons,"<p>Quantum secure direct communication is an important mode of quantum communication in which secret messages are securely communicated directly over a quantum channel. Quantum secure direct communication is also a basic cryptographic primitive for constructing other quantum communication tasks, such as quantum authentication and quantum dialog. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of quantum secure direct communication based on the DL04 protocol and equipped with single-photon frequency coding that explicitly demonstrated block transmission. In our experiment, we provided 16 different frequency channels, equivalent to a nibble of four-bit binary numbers for direct information transmission. The experiment firmly demonstrated the feasibility of quantum secure direct communication in the presence of noise and loss.</p>",[],True,"[""Jian-Yong Hu"", ""Bo Yu"", ""Ming-Yong Jing"", ""Lian-Tuan Xiao"", ""Suo-Tang Jia"", ""Guo-Qing Qin"", ""Gui-Lu Long""]","Hu, JY., Yu, B., Jing, MY. et al.

original article,Coupling of plasmonic nanopore pairs: facing dipoles attract each other,"<p>Control of the optical properties of nano-plasmonic structures is essential for next-generation optical circuits and high-throughput biosensing platforms. Realization of such nano-optical devices requires optical couplings of various nanostructured elements and field confinement at the nanoscale. In particular, symmetric coupling modes, also referred to as dark modes, have recently received considerable attention because these modes can confine light energy to small spaces. Although the coupling behavior of plasmonic nanoparticles has been relatively well studied, couplings of inverse structures, that is, holes and pores, remain partially unexplored. Even for the most fundamental coupling system of two dipolar holes, comparison of the symmetric and anti-symmetric coupling modes has not been performed. Here we present, for the first time, a systematic study of the symmetric and anti-symmetric coupling of nanopore pairs using cathodoluminescence by scanning transmission electron microscopy and electromagnetic simulation. The symmetric coupling mode, approximated as a pair of facing dipoles, is observed at a lower energy than that of the anti-symmetric coupling mode, indicating that the facing dipoles attract each other. The anti-symmetric coupling mode splits into the inner- and outer-edge localized modes as the coupling distance decreases. These coupling behaviors cannot be fully explained as inverses of coupled disks. Symmetric and anti-symmetric coupling modes are also observed in a short-range ordered pore array, where one pore supports multiple local resonance modes, depending on the distance to the neighboring pore. Accessibility to the observed symmetric modes by far field is also discussed, which is important for nanophotonic device applications.</p>",[],True,"[""Takumi Sannomiya"", ""Hikaru Saito"", ""Juliane Junesch"", ""Naoki Yamamoto""]","Sannomiya, T., Saito, H., Junesch, J. et al.

original article,Measurement of bound states in the continuum by a detector embedded in a photonic crystal,"<p>We directly measure optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) by embedding a photodetector into a photonic crystal slab. The BICs observed in our experiment are the result of accidental phase matching between incident, reflected and in-plane waves at seemingly random wave vectors in the photonic band structure. Our measurements were confirmed through a rigorously coupled-wave analysis simulation in conjunction with temporal coupled mode theory. Polarization mixing between photonic crystal slab modes was observed and described using a plane wave expansion simulation. The ability to probe the field intensity inside the photonic crystal and thereby to directly measure BICs represents a milestone in the development of integrated opto-electronic devices based on BICs.</p>",[],True,"[""Roman Gansch"", ""Stefan Kalchmair"", ""Patrice Genevet"", ""Tobias Zederbauer"", ""Hermann Detz"", ""Aaron M Andrews"", ""Werner Schrenk"", ""Federico Capasso"", ""Marko Lon\u010dar"", ""Gottfried Strasser""]","Gansch, R., Kalchmair, S., Genevet, P. et al.

original article,Light-driven micro-tool equipped with a syringe function,"<p>Leveraging developments in microfabrication open new possibilities for optical manipulation. With the structural design freedom from three-dimensional printing capabilities of two-photon polymerization, we are starting to see the emergence of cleverly shaped &#8216;light robots&#8217; or optically actuated micro-tools that closely resemble their macroscopic counterparts in function and sometimes even in form. In this work, we have fabricated a new type of light robot that is capable of loading and unloading cargo using photothermally induced convection currents within the body of the tool. We have demonstrated this using silica and polystyrene beads as cargo. The flow speeds of the cargo during loading and unloading are significantly larger than when using optical forces alone. This new type of light robot presents a mode of material transport that may have a significant impact on targeted drug delivery and nanofluidics injection.</p>",[],True,"[""Mark Jayson Villangca"", ""Darwin Palima"", ""Andrew Rafael Ba\u00f1as"", ""Jesper Gl\u00fcckstad""]","Villangca, M., Palima, D., Ba√±as, A. et al.
