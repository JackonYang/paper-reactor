original article,"Plasma-induced, nitrogen-doped graphene-based aerogels for high-performance supercapacitors","<p>Commonly used energy storage devices include stacked layers of active materials on two-dimensional sheets, and the limited specific surface area restricts the further development of energy storage. Three-dimensional (3D) structures with high specific surface areas would improve device performance. Herein, we present a novel procedure to fabricate macroscopic, high-quality, nitrogen-doped, 3D graphene/nanoparticle aerogels. The procedure includes vacuum filtration, freeze-drying, and plasma treatment, which can be further expanded for large-scale production of nitrogen-doped, graphene-based aerogels. The behavior of the supercapacitor is investigated using a typical nitrogen-doped graphene/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticle 3D structure (NG/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Compared with 3D graphene/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> structures prepared by the traditional hydrothermal method, the NG/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> supercapacitor prepared by the present method has a 153% improvement in specific capacitance, and there is no obvious decrease in specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. The present work provides a new and facile method to produce large-scale, 3D, graphene-based materials with high specific capacitance for energy storage.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Key Laboratory of Advanced Structural Materials, Ministry of Education & Advanced Institute of Materials Science, Changchun University of Technology, Changchun, 130012, China', 'authors': ['Xue-Yu Zhang', ',\xa0Shi-Han Sun', ',\xa0Yan-Rong Zhao', ',\xa0Yue Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Wei Lü']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Luminescence and Applications, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, 130033, China', 'authors': ['Xiao-Juan Sun', '\xa0&\xa0Da-Bing Li']}, {'address': 'School of Basic Sciences & Advanced Institute of Materials Science, Changchun University of Technology, Changchun, 130012, China', 'authors': ['Li Chen']}]",True,"['Xue-Yu Zhang', 'Shi-Han Sun', 'Xiao-Juan Sun', 'Yan-Rong Zhao', 'Li Chen', 'Yue Yang', 'Wei Lü', 'Da-Bing Li']","Zhang, X., Sun, S., Sun, X. et al.

original article,Synchronization-free all-solid-state laser system for stimulated Raman scattering microscopy,"<p>We introduce an extremely simple and highly stable system for stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. An 8-W, 450-fs Yb:KGW bulk oscillator with 41&#8201;MHz repetition rate pumps an optical parametric amplifier, which is seeded by a cw tunable external cavity diode laser. The output radiation is frequency doubled in a long PPLN crystal and generates 1.5-ps long narrowband pump pulses that are tunable between 760 and 820&#8201;nm with &gt;50&#8201;mW average power. Part of the oscillator output is sent through an etalon and creates Stokes pulses with 100&#8201;mW average power and 1.7&#8201;ps duration. We demonstrate SRS microscopy at a 30-&#956;s pixel dwell time with high chemical contrast, signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 45 and no need for balanced detection, thanks to the favorable noise properties of the bulk solid-state system.

original article,"Ca1−xLixAl1−xSi1+xN3:Eu2+ solid solutions as broadband, color-tunable and thermally robust red phosphors for superior color rendition white light-emitting diodes","<p>Color rendition, luminous efficacy and reliability are three key technical parameters for white light-emitting diodes (wLEDs) that are dominantly determined by down-conversion phosphors. However, there is usually an inevitable trade-off between color rendition and luminescence efficacy because the spectrum of red phosphor (that is, spectral broadness and position) cannot satisfy them simultaneously. In this work, we report a very promising red phosphor that can minimize the aforementioned trade-off via structure and band-gap engineering, achieved by introducing isostructural LiSi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub> into CaAlSiN<sub>3</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup>. The solid solution phosphors show both substantial spectra broadening (88&#8594;117&#8201;nm) and blueshift (652&#8594;642&#8201;nm), along with a significant improvement in thermal quenching (only a 6% reduction at 150&#8201;&#176;C), which are strongly associated with electronic and crystal structure evolutions. The broadband and robust red phosphor thus enables fabrication of super-high color rendering wLEDs (Ra=95 and R9=96) concurrently with the maintenance of a high-luminous efficacy (101&#8201;lm&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), validating its superiority in high-performance solid state lightings over currently used red phosphors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'College of Optics and Electronic Science and Technology, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, Zhejiang, China', 'authors': ['Le Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Dong Luo']}, {'address': 'College of Materials, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, Fujian, China', 'authors': ['Rong-Jun Xie']}, {'address': 'Sialon Group, National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Tsukuba, 305-0044, Ibaraki, Japan', 'authors': ['Rong-Jun Xie', ',\xa0Xiaojun Wang', ',\xa0Takashi Takeda', '\xa0&\xa0Naoto Hirosaki']}, {'address': 'Intematix Corporation, Fremont, 94538, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Yuanqiang Li']}, {'address': 'College of Sciences, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China', 'authors': ['Chong-Geng Ma']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Taiwan University', 'authors': ['Yi-Ting Tsai', '\xa0&\xa0Ru-Shi Liu']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Taipei University of Technology', 'authors': ['Ru-Shi Liu']}]",True,"['Le Wang', 'Rong-Jun Xie', 'Yuanqiang Li', 'Xiaojun Wang', 'Chong-Geng Ma', 'Dong Luo', 'Takashi Takeda', 'Yi-Ting Tsai', 'Ru-Shi Liu', 'Naoto Hirosaki']","Wang, L., Xie, R., Li, Y. et al.

original article,Revisiting Newton's rings with a plasmonic optical flat for high-accuracy surface inspection,"<p>Two parallel optical surfaces often exhibit colorful fringes along the lines of equal thickness because of the interference of light. This simple phenomenon allows one to observe subwavelength corrugations on a reflective surface by simply placing on it a flat reference dielectric surface, a so-called optical flat, and inspecting the resultant interference pattern. In this work, we extend this principle from dielectric surfaces to two-dimensional plasmonic nanostructures. Optical couplings between an Au nanodisk array and an Au thin film were measured quantitatively using two different techniques, namely, the classical Newton&#8217;s rings method and a closed-loop nano-positioning system. Extremely high spectral sensitivity to the inter-surface distance was observed in the near-field coupling regime, where a 1-nm change in distance could alter the resonance wavelength by almost 10&#8201;nm, &gt;40 times greater than the variation in the case without near-field coupling. With the help of a numerical fitting technique, the resonance wavelength could be determined with a precision of 0.03&#8201;nm, corresponding to a distance precision as high as 0.003&#8201;nm. Utilizing this effect, we demonstrated that a plasmonic nanodisk array can be utilized as a plasmonic optical flat, with which nanometer-deep grooves can be directly visualized using a low-cost microscope.</p>",,"[{'address': 'College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China', 'authors': ['Yun Zheng', ',\xa0Jie Bian', ',\xa0Ju-Xiu Liu', ',\xa0Peng Feng', ',\xa0Hai-Xiong Ge', '\xa0&\xa0Wei-Hua Zhang']}, {'address': 'Nanophotonics and Metrology Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Xiao-Long Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Olivier J F Martin']}]",True,"['Yun Zheng', 'Jie Bian', 'Xiao-Long Wang', 'Ju-Xiu Liu', 'Peng Feng', 'Hai-Xiong Ge', 'Olivier J F Martin', 'Wei-Hua Zhang']","Zheng, Y., Bian, J., Wang, X. et al.

original article,High-dimensional entanglement between distant atomic-ensemble memories,"<p>Entangled quantum states in high-dimensional space show many advantages compared with entangled states in two-dimensional space. The former enable quantum communication with higher channel capacity, enable more efficient quantum-information processing and are more feasible for closing the detection loophole in Bell test experiments. Establishing high-dimensional entangled memories is essential for long-distance communication, but its experimental realization is lacking. We experimentally established high-dimensional entanglement in orbital angular momentum space between two atomic ensembles separated by 1&#8201;m. We reconstructed the density matrix for a three-dimensional entanglement and obtained an entanglement fidelity of (83.9&#177;2.9)%. More importantly, we confirmed the successful preparation of a state entangled in more than three-dimensional space (up to seven-dimensional) using entanglement witnesses.

With a customized optical landscape distinct from that of conventional tweezers, not only can such &#8216;tug-of-war&#8217; tweezers stably trap and stretch a rod-shaped bacterium in the observing plane, but, more importantly, they can also impose a tunable lateral force that pulls apart cellular clusters without any tethering or mechanical movement.

original article,Nanoscopy reveals surface-metallic black phosphorus,"<p>Black phosphorus (BP) is an emerging two-dimensional material with intriguing physical properties. It is highly anisotropic and highly tunable by means of both the number of monolayers and surface doping. Here, we experimentally investigate and theoretically interpret the near-field properties of a-few-atomic-monolayer nanoflakes of BP. We discover near-field patterns of bright outside fringes and a high surface polarizability of nanofilm BP consistent with its surface-metallic, plasmonic behavior at mid-infrared frequencies &lt;1176&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. We conclude that these fringes are caused by the formation of a highly polarizable layer at the BP surface. This layer has a thickness of ~1&#8201;nm and exhibits plasmonic behavior.

original article,Super-resolution dipole orientation mapping via polarization demodulation,"<p>Fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM) aims to detect the dipole orientation of fluorophores and to resolve structural information for labeled organelles via wide-field or confocal microscopy. Conventional FPM often suffers from the presence of a large number of molecules within the diffraction-limited volume, with averaged fluorescence polarization collected from a group of dipoles with different orientations. Here, we apply sparse deconvolution and least-squares estimation to fluorescence polarization modulation data and demonstrate a super-resolution dipole orientation mapping (SDOM) method that resolves the effective dipole orientation from a much smaller number of fluorescent molecules within a sub-diffraction focal area. We further apply this method to resolve structural details in both fixed and live cells. For the first time, we show that different borders of a dendritic spine neck exhibit a heterogeneous distribution of dipole orientation. Furthermore, we illustrate that the dipole is always perpendicular to the direction of actin filaments in mammalian kidney cells and radially distributed in the hourglass structure of the septin protein under specific labelling. The accuracy of the dipole orientation can be further mapped using the orientation uniform factor, which shows the superiority of SDOM compared with its wide-field counterpart as the number of molecules is decreased within the smaller focal area. Using the inherent feature of the orientation dipole, the SDOM technique, with its fast imaging speed (at sub-second scale), can be applied to a broad range of fluorescently labeled biological systems to simultaneously resolve the valuable dipole orientation information with super-resolution imaging.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China', 'authors': ['Karl Zhanghao', ',\xa0Xu-San Yang', ',\xa0Miao-Yan Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Peng Xi']}, {'address': 'Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China', 'authors': ['Long Chen', ',\xa0Zhen-Li Jing', '\xa0&\xa0Jun-Tao Gao']}, {'address': 'Bioinformatics Division, TNLIST, MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Center for Synthetic & Systems Biology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China', 'authors': ['Long Chen', ',\xa0Zhen-Li Jing', ',\xa0Michael Q Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Jun-Tao Gao']}, {'address': 'Department of Radiology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, 100191, China', 'authors': ['Hong-Bin Han']}, {'address': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Center for Systems Biology, The University of Texas, Dallas 800 West Campbell Road, RL11, Richardson, 75080-3021, TX, USA', 'authors': ['Michael Q Zhang']}, {'address': 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China', 'authors': ['Michael Q Zhang']}, {'address': 'Institute for Biomedical Materials and Devices (IBMD), Faculty of Science, University of Technology, Sydney, 2007, NSW, Australia', 'authors': ['Dayong Jin', '\xa0&\xa0Peng Xi']}]",True,"['Karl Zhanghao', 'Long Chen', 'Xu-San Yang', 'Miao-Yan Wang', 'Zhen-Li Jing', 'Hong-Bin Han', 'Michael Q Zhang', 'Dayong Jin', 'Jun-Tao Gao', 'Peng Xi']","Zhanghao, K., Chen, L., Yang, X. et al.

original article,Antenna-assisted picosecond control of nanoscale phase transition in vanadium dioxide,"<p>Nanoscale devices in which the interaction with light can be configured using external control signals hold great interest for next-generation optoelectronic circuits. Materials exhibiting a structural or electronic phase transition offer a large modulation contrast with multi-level optical switching and memory functionalities. In addition, plasmonic nanoantennas can provide an efficient enhancement mechanism for both the optically induced excitation and the readout of materials strategically positioned in their local environment. Here, we demonstrate picosecond all-optical switching of the local phase transition in plasmonic antenna-vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>) hybrids, exploiting strong resonant field enhancement and selective optical pumping in plasmonic hotspots. Polarization- and wavelength-dependent pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy of multifrequency crossed antenna arrays shows that nanoscale optical switching in plasmonic hotspots does not affect neighboring antennas placed within 100&#8201;nm of the excited antennas. The antenna-assisted pumping mechanism is confirmed by numerical model calculations of the resonant, antenna-mediated local heating on a picosecond time scale. The hybrid, nanoscale excitation mechanism results in 20 times reduced switching energies and 5 times faster recovery times than a VO<sub>2</sub> film without antennas, enabling fully reversible switching at over two million cycles per second and at local switching energies in the picojoule range. The hybrid solution of antennas and VO<sub>2</sub> provides a conceptual framework to merge the field localization and phase-transition response, enabling precise, nanoscale optical memory functionalities.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics and Astronomy, Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK', 'authors': ['Otto L Muskens', '\xa0&\xa0Yudong Wang']}, {'address': 'Department of Electricity and Electronics, FCT-ZTF, UPV-EHU, Bilbao, 48080, Spain', 'authors': ['Luca Bergamini', '\xa0&\xa0Nerea Zabala']}, {'address': 'Materials Physics Center, CSIC-UPV/EHU and DIPC, San Sebastian, 20018, Spain', 'authors': ['Luca Bergamini', ',\xa0Nerea Zabala', '\xa0&\xa0Javier Aizpurua']}, {'address': 'Nano Group, Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK', 'authors': ['Yudong Wang', '\xa0&\xa0CH de Groot']}, {'address': 'Materials and Physics Research Centre, University of Salford, Manchester, M5 4WT, UK', 'authors': ['Jeffrey M Gaskell', '\xa0&\xa0David W Sheel']}]",True,"['Otto L Muskens', 'Luca Bergamini', 'Yudong Wang', 'Jeffrey M Gaskell', 'Nerea Zabala', 'CH de Groot', 'David W Sheel', 'Javier Aizpurua']","Muskens, O., Bergamini, L., Wang, Y. et al.
