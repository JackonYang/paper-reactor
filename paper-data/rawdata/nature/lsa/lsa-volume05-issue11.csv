original article,Tuning the chemiluminescence of a luminol flow using plasmonic nanoparticles,"<p>We have discovered a strong increase in the intensity of the chemiluminescence of a luminol flow and a dramatic modification of its spectral shape in the presence of metallic nanoparticles. We observed that pumping gold and silver nanoparticles into a microfluidic device fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane prolongs the glow time of luminol. We have demonstrated that the intensity of chemiluminescence in the presence of nanospheres depends on the position along the microfluidic serpentine channel. We show that the enhancement factors can be controlled by the nanoparticle size and material. Spectrally, the emission peak of luminol overlaps with the absorption band of the nanospheres, which maximizes the effect of confined plasmons on the optical density of states in the vicinity of the luminol emission peak. These observations, interpreted in terms of the Purcell effect mediated by nano-plasmons, form an essential step toward the development of microfluidic chips with gain media. Practical implementation of the discovered effect will include improving the detection limits of chemiluminescence for forensic science, research in biology and chemistry, and a number of commercial applications.</p>",[],True,"[""Alina Karabchevsky"", ""Ali Mosayyebi"", ""Alexey V Kavokin""]","Karabchevsky, A., Mosayyebi, A. & Kavokin, A.

original article,Phase-matched third-harmonic generation via doubly resonant optical surface modes in 1D photonic crystals,"<p>Efficient nonlinear conversion requires that interacting optical waves maintain a consistent phase relationship when traveling in a medium despite its dispersion. Birefringent phase-matching, which is often used to compensate for the dispersion, is not applicable to optically isotropic nonlinear materials. Here, we present a one-dimensional photonic crystal structure that allows the propagation of optical surface waves, both at the fundamental and third-harmonic frequencies, as an efficient medium for phase-matched third-harmonic generation. A unique advantage of this structure is that the effective refractive indices for the surface waves are similar to the refractive index of air at both frequencies. This allows phase-matching between the first and third harmonics, and a visible collinear beam of the third harmonic is produced at the prism-coupled output. Moreover, these optical surface waves propagate over long distances even if a lossy nonlinear nanofilm is deposited onto the photonic crystal surface. We provide experimental results for third-harmonic generation at a wavelength of 410&#8201;nm for a bare dielectric Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> multilayer structure and for the same structure coated with a 15-nm GaAs film.</p>",[],True,"[""Valery N Konopsky"", ""Elena V Alieva"", ""Sergey Yu Alyatkin"", ""Alexey A Melnikov"", ""Sergey V Chekalin"", ""Vladimir M Agranovich""]","N Konopsky, V., V Alieva, E., Yu Alyatkin, S. et al.

original article,In situ frequency gating and beam splitting of vacuum- and extreme-ultraviolet pulses,"<p>Monochromatization of high-harmonic sources has opened fascinating perspectives regarding time-resolved photoemission from all phases of matter. Such studies have invariably involved the use of spectral filters or spectrally dispersive optical components that are inherently lossy and technically complex. Here we present a new technique for the spectral selection of near-threshold harmonics and their spatial separation from the driving beams without any optical elements. We discover the existence of a narrow phase-matching gate resulting from the combination of the non-collinear generation geometry in an extended medium, atomic resonances and absorption. Our technique offers a filter contrast of up to 10<sup>4</sup> for the selected harmonics against the adjacent ones and offers multiple temporally synchronized beamlets in a single unified scheme. We demonstrate the selective generation of 133, 80 or 56&#8201;nm femtosecond pulses from a 400-nm driver, which is specific to the target gas. These results open new pathways towards phase-sensitive multi-pulse spectroscopy in the vacuum- and extreme-ultraviolet, and frequency-selective output coupling from enhancement cavities.</p>",[],True,"[""Rajendran Rajeev"", ""Johannes Hellwagner"", ""Anne Schumacher"", ""Inga Jordan"", ""Martin Huppert"", ""Andres Tehlar"", ""Bhargava Ram Niraghatam"", ""Denitsa Baykusheva"", ""Nan Lin"", ""Aaron von Conta"", ""Hans Jakob W\u00f6rner""]","Rajeev, R., Hellwagner, J., Schumacher, A. et al.

original article,Information entropy of coding metasurface,"<p>Because of their exceptional capability to tailor the effective medium parameters, metamaterials have been widely used to control electromagnetic waves, which has led to the observation of many interesting phenomena, for example, negative refraction, invisibility cloaking, and anomalous reflections and transmissions. However, the studies of metamaterials or metasurfaces are mainly limited to their physical features; currently, there is a lack of viewpoints on metamaterials and metasurfaces from the information perspective. Here we propose to measure the information of a coding metasurface using Shannon entropy. We establish an analytical connection between the coding pattern of an arbitrary coding metasurface and its far-field pattern. We introduce geometrical entropy to describe the information of the coding pattern (or coding sequence) and physical entropy to describe the information of the far-field pattern of the metasurface. The coding metasurface is demonstrated to enhance the information in transmitting messages, and the amount of enhanced information can be manipulated by designing the coding pattern with different information entropies. The proposed concepts and entropy control method will be helpful in new information systems (for example, communication, radar and imaging) that are based on the coding metasurfaces.</p>",[],True,"[""Tie-Jun Cui"", ""Shuo Liu"", ""Lian-Lin Li""]","Cui, TJ., Liu, S. & Li, LL.

original article,Parity violation in chiral structure creation under femtosecond laser irradiation in silica glass?,"<p>The paper addresses the creation of circular optical properties from a femtosecond laser light beam with a linear polarization in an achiral material (glass) under an orthogonal incidence. In this situation, all aspects of the experiment are achiral and therefore should not give rise to chiral property creation. From that observation, we propose an interpretation that involves the action of a light-induced torque on the matter carrying a light-induced dielectric moment. We found that a direct current (DC) electric field could be produced in the lattice by the femtosecond laser in our conditions and that a non-collinear dielectric moment is created by a nonlinear effect between the DC electric field and the stress field due to the transformation of the material. We reveal that it is possible to break the chiral symmetry of glass using an intense, ultrashort laser light pulse.</p>",[],True,"[""Bertrand Poumellec"", ""Matthieu Lancry"", ""Rudy Desmarchelier"", ""Evelyne Herv\u00e9"", ""Bernard Bourguignon""]","Poumellec, B., Lancry, M., Desmarchelier, R. et al.
