original article,Manipulation and detection of single nanoparticles and biomolecules by a photonic nanojet,"<p>Optical methods to manipulate and detect nanoscale objects are highly desired in both nanomaterials and molecular biology fields. Optical tweezers have been used to manipulate objects that range in size from a few hundred nanometres to several micrometres. The emergence of near-field methods that overcome the diffraction limit has enabled the manipulation of objects below 100&#8201;nm. A highly free manipulation with signal-enhanced real-time detection, however, remains a challenge for single sub-100-nm nanoparticles or biomolecules. Here we show an approach that uses a photonic nanojet to perform the manipulation and detection of single sub-100-nm objects. With the photonic nanojet generated by a dielectric microlens bound to an optical fibre probe, three-dimensional manipulations were achieved for a single 85-nm fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticle as well as for a plasmid DNA molecule. Backscattering and fluorescent signals were detected with the enhancement factors up to &#8764;10<sup>3</sup> and &#8764;30, respectively. The demonstrated approach provides a potentially powerful tool for nanostructure assembly, biosensing and single-biomolecule studies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Nanophotonics, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 511443, China', 'authors': ['Yu-Chao Li', ',\xa0Hong-Bao Xin', ',\xa0Yao Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Bao-Jun Li']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China', 'authors': ['Yu-Chao Li', '\xa0&\xa0Hong-Xiang Lei']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Technology, School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, 250100, China', 'authors': ['Lin-Lin Liu']}, {'address': 'National Engineering Research Centre for Beijing Biochip Technology, Beijing, 102206, China', 'authors': ['Yan-Ze Li']}]",True,"['Yu-Chao Li', 'Hong-Bao Xin', 'Hong-Xiang Lei', 'Lin-Lin Liu', 'Yan-Ze Li', 'Yao Zhang', 'Bao-Jun Li']","Li, Y., Xin, H., Lei, H. et al.

original article,Concealing arbitrary objects remotely with multi-folded transformation optics,"<p>An invisibility cloak that can hide an arbitrary object external to the cloak itself has not been devised before. In this Letter, we introduce a novel way to design a remote cloaking device that makes any object located at a certain distance invisible. This is accomplished using multi-folded transformation optics to remotely generate a hidden region around the object that no field can penetrate and that does not disturb the far-field scattering electromagnetic field. As a result, any object in the hidden region can stay in position or move freely within that region and remain invisible. Our idea is further extended in order to design a remote illusion optics that can transform any arbitrary object into another one. Unlike other cloaking methods, this method would require no knowledge of the details of the object itself. The proposed multi-folded transformation optics will be crucial in the design of remote devices in a variety of contexts.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory for Modern Optical Instrumentation, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China', 'authors': ['Bin Zheng', ',\xa0Hamza Ahmad Madni', ',\xa0Xu Liu', '\xa0&\xa0Hongsheng Chen']}, {'address': 'The Innovative Institute of Electromagnetic Information and Electronic Integration, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China', 'authors': ['Bin Zheng', ',\xa0Hamza Ahmad Madni', ',\xa0Ran Hao', ',\xa0Xianmin Zhang', ',\xa0Erping Li', '\xa0&\xa0Hongsheng Chen']}, {'address': 'The Electromagnetics Academy at Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China', 'authors': ['Bin Zheng', ',\xa0Hamza Ahmad Madni', '\xa0&\xa0Hongsheng Chen']}]",True,"['Bin Zheng', 'Hamza Ahmad Madni', 'Ran Hao', 'Xianmin Zhang', 'Xu Liu', 'Erping Li', 'Hongsheng Chen']","Zheng, B., Madni, H., Hao, R. et al.

original article,Excitation and propagation of surface plasmon polaritons on a non-structured surface with a permittivity gradient,"<p>Accompanied by the rise of plasmonic materials beyond those based on noble metals and the development of advanced materials processing techniques, it is important to understand the plasmonic behavior of materials with large-scale inhomogeneity (such as gradient permittivity materials) because they cannot be modeled simply as scatterers. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the excitation and propagation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on a planar interface between a homogeneous dielectric and a material with a gradient of negative permittivity. We demonstrate the following: (i) free-space propagating waves and surface waves can be coupled by a gradient negative-permittivity material and (ii) the coupling can be enhanced if the material permittivity variation is suitably designed. This theory is then verified by numerical simulations. A direct application of this theory, &#8216;rainbow trapping&#8217;, is also proposed, considering a realistic design based on doped indium antimonide. This theory may lead to various applications, such as ultracompact spectroscopy and dynamically controllable generation of SPPs.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Xi Wang', ',\xa0Yang Deng', ',\xa0Qitong Li', ',\xa0Yijing Huang', ',\xa0Zilun Gong', ',\xa0Kyle B Tom', '\xa0&\xa0Jie Yao']}, {'address': 'Environmental Energy Technologies Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Zilun Gong']}, {'address': 'Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Kyle B Tom', '\xa0&\xa0Jie Yao']}]",True,"['Xi Wang', 'Yang Deng', 'Qitong Li', 'Yijing Huang', 'Zilun Gong', 'Kyle B Tom', 'Jie Yao']","Wang, X., Deng, Y., Li, Q. et al.

original article,Ultrahigh-speed distributed Brillouin reflectometry,"<p>Optical fibre sensors based on Brillouin scattering have been vigorously studied in the context of structural health monitoring on account of their capacity for distributed strain and temperature measurements. However, real-time distributed strain measurement has been achieved only for two-end-access systems; such systems reduce the degree of freedom in embedding the sensors into structures, and furthermore render the measurement no longer feasible when extremely high loss or breakage occurs at a point along the sensing fibre. Here, we demonstrate real-time distributed measurement with an intrinsically one-end-access reflectometry configuration by using a correlation-domain technique. In this method, the Brillouin gain spectrum is obtained at high speed using a voltage-controlled oscillator, and the Brillouin frequency shift is converted into a phase delay of a synchronous sinusoidal waveform; the phase delay is subsequently converted into a voltage, which can be directly measured. When a single-point measurement is performed at an arbitrary position, a strain sampling rate of up to 100&#8201;kHz is experimentally verified by detecting locally applied dynamic strain at 1&#8201;kHz. When distributed measurements are performed at 100 points with 10 times averaging, a repetition rate of 100&#8201;Hz is verified by tracking a mechanical wave propagating along the fibre. Some drawbacks of this ultrahigh-speed configuration, including the reduced measurement accuracy, lowered spatial resolution and limited strain dynamic range, are also discussed.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Midori-ku, Yokohama, 226-8503, Japan', 'authors': ['Yosuke Mizuno', '\xa0&\xa0Kentaro Nakamura']}, {'address': 'Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-8904, Japan', 'authors': ['Neisei Hayashi']}, {'address': 'Servo Laboratory, FANUC Corporation, Oshino-mura, 401-0597, Yamanashi, Japan', 'authors': ['Hideyuki Fukuda']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Chung-Ang University, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, 06974, Korea', 'authors': ['Kwang Yong Song']}]",True,"['Yosuke Mizuno', 'Neisei Hayashi', 'Hideyuki Fukuda', 'Kwang Yong Song', 'Kentaro Nakamura']","Mizuno, Y., Hayashi, N., Fukuda, H. et al.

original article,Functional optoacoustic neuro-tomography for scalable whole-brain monitoring of calcium indicators,"<p>Non-invasive observation of spatiotemporal activity of large neural populations distributed over entire brains is a longstanding goal of neuroscience. We developed a volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography platform for imaging neural activation deep in scattering brains. It can record 100 volumetric frames per second across scalable fields of view ranging between 50 and 1000&#8201;mm<sup>3</sup> with respective spatial resolution of 35&#8211;200&#8201;&#956;m. Experiments performed in immobilized and freely swimming larvae and in adult zebrafish brains expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G demonstrate, for the first time, the fundamental ability to directly track neural dynamics using optoacoustics while overcoming the longstanding penetration barrier of optical imaging in scattering brains. The newly developed platform thus offers unprecedented capabilities for functional whole-brain observations of fast calcium dynamics; in combination with optoacoustics' well-established capacity for resolving vascular hemodynamics, it could open new vistas in the study of neural activity and neurovascular coupling in health and disease.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Biological and Medical Imaging (IBMI), Helmholtz Center Munich, Neuherberg, Germany', 'authors': ['X Luís Deán-Ben', ',\xa0Gali Sela', ',\xa0Antonella Lauri', ',\xa0Moritz Kneipp', ',\xa0Vasilis Ntziachristos', ',\xa0Gil G Westmeyer', '\xa0&\xa0Daniel Razansky']}, {'address': 'Institute of Developmental Genetics, Helmholtz Center Munich, Neuherberg, Germany', 'authors': ['Antonella Lauri', '\xa0&\xa0Gil G Westmeyer']}, {'address': 'Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany', 'authors': ['Moritz Kneipp', ',\xa0Vasilis Ntziachristos', ',\xa0Gil G Westmeyer', '\xa0&\xa0Daniel Razansky']}, {'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel', 'authors': ['Shy Shoham']}]",True,"['X Luís Deán-Ben', 'Gali Sela', 'Antonella Lauri', 'Moritz Kneipp', 'Vasilis Ntziachristos', 'Gil G Westmeyer', 'Shy Shoham', 'Daniel Razansky']","Deán-Ben, X., Sela, G., Lauri, A. et al.

original article,Intermittent chaos for ergodic light trapping in a photonic fiber plate,"<p>Extracting the light trapped in a waveguide, or the opposite effect of trapping light in a thin region and guiding it perpendicular to its incident propagation direction, is essential for optimal energetic performance in illumination, display or light harvesting devices. Here we demonstrate that the paradoxical goal of letting as much light in or out while maintaining the wave effectively trapped can be achieved with a periodic array of interpenetrated fibers forming a photonic fiber plate. Photons entering perpendicular to that plate may be trapped in an intermittent chaotic trajectory, leading to an optically ergodic system. We fabricated such a photonic fiber plate and showed that for a solar cell incorporated on one of the plate surfaces, light absorption is greatly enhanced. Confirming this, we found the unexpected result that a more chaotic photon trajectory reduces the production of photon scattering entropy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Castelldefels (Barcelona), 08860, Spain', 'authors': ['Marina Mariano', ',\xa0Pablo Romero-Gomez', '\xa0&\xa0Jordi Martorell']}, {'address': 'Département de Physique, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Campus de la Plaine, Bruxelles, B-1050, Belgium', 'authors': ['Gregory Kozyreff']}, {'address': 'Departament Enginyeria Electrònica, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, 08034, Spain', 'authors': ['Luis G Gerling', '\xa0&\xa0Joaquim Puigdollers']}, {'address': 'Departamento de Física Teórica de la Materia Condensada and Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, 28049, Spain', 'authors': ['Jorge Bravo-Abad']}, {'address': 'Departament de Física, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Terrassa, 08222, Spain', 'authors': ['Jordi Martorell']}]",True,"['Marina Mariano', 'Gregory Kozyreff', 'Luis G Gerling', 'Pablo Romero-Gomez', 'Joaquim Puigdollers', 'Jorge Bravo-Abad', 'Jordi Martorell']","Mariano, M., Kozyreff, G., Gerling, L. et al.
