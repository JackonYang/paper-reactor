original article,Optical imaging of post-embryonic zebrafish using multi orientation raster scan optoacoustic mesoscopy,"<p>Whole-body optical imaging of post-embryonic stage model organisms is a challenging and long sought-after goal. It requires a combination of high-resolution performance and high-penetration depth. Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) mesoscopy holds great promise, as it penetrates deeper than optical and optoacoustic microscopy while providing high-spatial resolution. However, optoacoustic mesoscopic techniques only offer partial visibility of oriented structures, such as blood vessels, due to a limited angular detection aperture or the use of ultrasound frequencies that yield insufficient resolution. We introduce 360&#176; multi orientation (multi-projection) raster scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (MORSOM) based on detecting an ultra-wide frequency bandwidth (up to 160&#8201;MHz) and weighted deconvolution to synthetically enlarge the angular aperture. We report unprecedented isotropic in-plane resolution at the 9&#8211;17&#8201;&#956;m range and improved signal to noise ratio in phantoms and opaque 21-day-old Zebrafish. We find that MORSOM performance defines a new operational specification for optoacoustic mesoscopy of adult organisms, with possible applications in the developmental biology of adulthood and aging.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Chair for Biological Imaging, Technische Universität München, München, D-81675, Germany', 'authors': ['Murad Omar', ',\xa0Johannes Rebling', ',\xa0Mathias Schwarz', '\xa0&\xa0Vasilis Ntziachristos']}, {'address': 'Institute for Biological and Medical Imaging, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, D-85764, Germany', 'authors': ['Murad Omar', ',\xa0Johannes Rebling', ',\xa0Mathias Schwarz', '\xa0&\xa0Vasilis Ntziachristos']}, {'address': 'Carl Zeiss AG, Corporate Research and Technology, Jena, D-07745, Germany', 'authors': ['Kai Wicker', '\xa0&\xa0Tobias Schmitt-Manderbach']}, {'address': 'ESPCI Paris, PSL Research University, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Langevin, Paris, F-75005, France', 'authors': ['Jérôme Gateau']}, {'address': 'Research Unit Sensory Biology and Organogenesis, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, D-85764, Germany', 'authors': ['Hérnan López-Schier']}, {'address': 'Carl Zeiss Vision International GmbH, Technology & Innovation, Aalen, D-73430, Germany', 'authors': ['Timo Mappes']}]",True,"['Murad Omar', 'Johannes Rebling', 'Kai Wicker', 'Tobias Schmitt-Manderbach', 'Mathias Schwarz', 'Jérôme Gateau', 'Hérnan López-Schier', 'Timo Mappes', 'Vasilis Ntziachristos']","Omar, M., Rebling, J., Wicker, K. et al.

original article,Attosecond precision multi-kilometer laser-microwave network,"<p>Synchronous laser-microwave networks delivering attosecond timing precision are highly desirable in many advanced applications, such as geodesy, very-long-baseline interferometry, high-precision navigation and multi-telescope arrays. In particular, rapidly expanding photon-science facilities like X-ray free-electron lasers and intense laser beamlines require system-wide attosecond-level synchronization of dozens of optical and microwave signals up to kilometer distances. Once equipped with such precision, these facilities will initiate radically new science by shedding light on molecular and atomic processes happening on the attosecond timescale, such as intramolecular charge transfer, Auger processes and their impacts on X-ray imaging. Here we present for the first time a complete synchronous laser-microwave network with attosecond precision, which is achieved through new metrological devices and careful balancing of fiber nonlinearities and fundamental noise contributions. We demonstrate timing stabilization of a 4.7-km fiber network and remote optical&#8211;optical synchronization across a 3.5-km fiber link with an overall timing jitter of 580 and 680 attoseconds root-mean-square, respectively, for over 40&#8201;h. Ultimately, we realize a complete laser-microwave network with 950-attosecond timing jitter for 18&#8201;h. This work can enable next-generation attosecond photon-science facilities to revolutionize many research fields from structural biology to material science and chemistry to fundamental physics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg, 22607, Germany', 'authors': ['Ming Xin', ',\xa0Kemal Şafak', ',\xa0Aram Kalaydzhyan', ',\xa0Wen-Ting Wang', ',\xa0Oliver D Mücke', '\xa0&\xa0Franz X Kärtner']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Hamburg and the Hamburg Center for Ultrafast Imaging, Hamburg, 22761, Germany', 'authors': ['Kemal Şafak', ',\xa0Oliver D Mücke', '\xa0&\xa0Franz X Kärtner']}, {'address': 'Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Michael Y Peng', '\xa0&\xa0Franz X Kärtner']}]",True,"['Ming Xin', 'Kemal Şafak', 'Michael Y Peng', 'Aram Kalaydzhyan', 'Wen-Ting Wang', 'Oliver D Mücke', 'Franz X Kärtner']","Xin, M., Şafak, K., Peng, M. et al.

original article,High-finesse Fabry–Perot cavities with bidimensional Si3N4 photonic-crystal slabs,"<p>Light scattering by a two-dimensional photonic-crystal slab (PCS) can result in marked interference effects associated with Fano resonances. Such devices offer appealing alternatives to distributed Bragg reflectors and filters for various applications, such as optical wavelength and polarization filters, reflectors, semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, bio-sensors and non-linear optical components. Suspended PCS also have natural applications in the field of optomechanics, where the mechanical modes of a suspended slab interact via radiation pressure with the optical field of a high-finesse cavity. The reflectivity and transmission properties of a defect-free suspended PCS around normal incidence can be used to couple out-of-plane mechanical modes to an optical field by integrating it in a free-space cavity. Here we demonstrate the successful implementation of a PCS reflector on a high-tensile stress Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanomembrane. We illustrate the physical process underlying the high reflectivity by measuring the photonic-crystal band diagram. Moreover, we introduce a clear theoretical description of the membrane scattering properties in the presence of optical losses. By embedding the PCS inside a high-finesse cavity, we fully characterize its optical properties. The spectrally, angular- and polarization-resolved measurements demonstrate the wide tunability of the membrane&#8217;s reflectivity, from nearly 0 to 99.9470&#177;0.0025%, and show that material absorption is not the main source of optical loss. Moreover, the cavity storage time demonstrated in this work exceeds the mechanical period of low-order mechanical drum modes. This so-called resolved-sideband condition is a prerequisite to achieve quantum control of the mechanical resonator with light.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, UPMC-Sorbonne Universités, CNRS, ENS-PSL Research University, Collège de France, 4 place Jussieu, Case 74, Paris, F75252, France', 'authors': ['Xu Chen', ',\xa0Clément Chardin', ',\xa0Kevin Makles', ',\xa0Charles Caër', ',\xa0Sheon Chua', ',\xa0Tristan Briant', ',\xa0Pierre-François Cohadon', ',\xa0Antoine Heidmann', ',\xa0Thibaut Jacqmin', '\xa0&\xa0Samuel Deléglise']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire de Photonique et de Nanostructures LPN-CNRS/CNRS, Route de Nozay, Marcoussis, 91460, France', 'authors': ['Rémy Braive', '\xa0&\xa0Isabelle Robert-Philip']}, {'address': 'Université Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, 75207, France', 'authors': ['Rémy Braive']}]",True,"['Xu Chen', 'Clément Chardin', 'Kevin Makles', 'Charles Caër', 'Sheon Chua', 'Rémy Braive', 'Isabelle Robert-Philip', 'Tristan Briant', 'Pierre-François Cohadon', 'Antoine Heidmann', 'Thibaut Jacqmin', 'Samuel Deléglise']","Chen, X., Chardin, C., Makles, K. et al.

original article,Bragg-mirror-like circular dichroism in bio-inspired quadruple-gyroid 4srs nanostructures,"<p>The smooth and tailorable spectral response of Bragg mirrors has driven their pervasive use in optical systems requiring customizable spectral control of beam propagation. However, the simple nature of Bragg mirror reflection prevents their application to the control of important polarization states such as circular polarization. While helical and gyroid-based nanostructures exhibiting circular dichroism have been developed extensively to address this limitation, they are often restricted by the spectral inconsistency of their optical response. Here we present the fabrication and characterization of quadruple-gyroid 4srs nanostructures exhibiting bio-inspired Bragg-mirror-like circular dichroism: a smooth and uniform band of circular dichroism reminiscent of the spectrum of a simple multilayer Bragg-mirror. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the circular dichroism produced by 4srs nanostructures are robust to changes in incident angle and beam collimation, providing a new platform to create and engineer circular dichroism for functional circular polarization manipulation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory of Artificial-Intelligence Nanophotonics and CUDOS, School of Science, RMIT University, Melbourne, 3001, Victoria, Australia', 'authors': ['Benjamin P Cumming', '\xa0&\xa0Min Gu']}, {'address': 'Centre for Micro-Photonics, Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, 3122, Victoria, Australia', 'authors': ['Benjamin P Cumming', '\xa0&\xa0Min Gu']}, {'address': 'School of Engineering and Information Technology, Mathematics and Statistics, Murdoch University, Murdoch, Western Australia 6150, Australia', 'authors': ['Gerd E Schröder-Turk']}, {'address': 'Laser Physics Centre and CUDOS, Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory 2601, Australia', 'authors': ['Sukanta Debbarma']}]",True,"['Benjamin P Cumming', 'Gerd E Schröder-Turk', 'Sukanta Debbarma', 'Min Gu']","Cumming, B., Schröder-Turk, G., Debbarma, S. et al.

original article,Control over emissivity of zero-static-power thermal emitters based on phase-changing material GST,"<p>Controlling the emissivity of a thermal emitter has attracted growing interest, with a view toward a new generation of thermal emission devices. To date, all demonstrations have involved using sustained external electric or thermal consumption to maintain a desired emissivity. In the present study, we demonstrated control over the emissivity of a thermal emitter consisting of a film of phase-changing material Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> (GST) on top of a metal film. This thermal emitter achieves broad wavelength-selective spectral emissivity in the mid-infrared. The peak emissivity approaches the ideal blackbody maximum, and a maximum extinction ratio of &gt;10&#8201;dB is attainable by switching the GST between the crystalline and amorphous phases. By controlling the intermediate phases, the emissivity can be continuously tuned. This switchable, tunable, wavelength-selective and thermally stable thermal emitter will pave the way toward the ultimate control of thermal emissivity in the field of fundamental science as well as for energy harvesting and thermal control applications, including thermophotovoltaics, light sources, infrared imaging and radiative coolers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China', 'authors': ['Kai-Kai Du', ',\xa0Qiang Li', ',\xa0Ji-Chao Ding', ',\xa0Yue Lu', '\xa0&\xa0Min Qiu']}, {'address': 'College of Information Science & Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China', 'authors': ['Yan-Biao Lyu', '\xa0&\xa0Zhi-Yuan Cheng']}]",True,"['Kai-Kai Du', 'Qiang Li', 'Yan-Biao Lyu', 'Ji-Chao Ding', 'Yue Lu', 'Zhi-Yuan Cheng', 'Min Qiu']","Du, K., Li, Q., Lyu, Y. et al.

original article,Ultrafast laser-scanning time-stretch imaging at visible wavelengths,"<p>Optical time-stretch imaging enables the continuous capture of non-repetitive events in real time at a line-scan rate of tens of MHz&#8212;a distinct advantage for the ultrafast dynamics monitoring and high-throughput screening that are widely needed in biological microscopy. However, its potential is limited by the technical challenge of achieving significant pulse stretching (that is, high temporal dispersion) and low optical loss, which are the critical factors influencing imaging quality, in the visible spectrum demanded in many of these applications. We present a new pulse-stretching technique, termed free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay (FACED), with three distinguishing features absent in the prevailing dispersive-fiber-based implementations: (1) it generates substantial, reconfigurable temporal dispersion in free space (&gt;1&#8201;ns&#8201;nm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) with low intrinsic loss (&lt;6&#8201;dB) at visible wavelengths; (2) its wavelength-invariant pulse-stretching operation introduces a new paradigm in time-stretch imaging, which can now be implemented both with and without spectral encoding; and (3) pulse stretching in FACED inherently provides an ultrafast all-optical laser-beam scanning mechanism at a line-scan rate of tens of MHz. Using FACED, we demonstrate not only ultrafast laser-scanning time-stretch imaging with superior bright-field image quality compared with previous work but also, for the first time, MHz fluorescence and colorized time-stretch microscopy. Our results show that this technique could enable a wider scope of applications in high-speed and high-throughput biological microscopy that were once out of reach.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong 999077, China', 'authors': ['Jiang-Lai Wu', ',\xa0Yi-Qing Xu', ',\xa0Xiao-Ming Wei', ',\xa0Antony CS Chan', ',\xa0Anson HL Tang', ',\xa0Andy KS Lau', ',\xa0Edmund Y Lam', ',\xa0Kenneth KY Wong', '\xa0&\xa0Kevin K Tsia']}, {'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, Washington, USA', 'authors': ['Jing-Jiang Xu']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, 999077, China', 'authors': ['Bob MF Chung', '\xa0&\xa0Ho Cheung Shum']}]",True,"['Jiang-Lai Wu', 'Yi-Qing Xu', 'Jing-Jiang Xu', 'Xiao-Ming Wei', 'Antony CS Chan', 'Anson HL Tang', 'Andy KS Lau', 'Bob MF Chung', 'Ho Cheung Shum', 'Edmund Y Lam', 'Kenneth KY Wong', 'Kevin K Tsia']","Wu, J., Xu, Y., Xu, J. et al.

original article,Generating scattering dark states through the Fano interference between excitons and an individual silicon nanogroove,"<p>Effective interactions between excitons and resonating nanocavities are important for many emerging applications in nanophotonics. Although plasmonic nanocavities are considered promising substitutes for diffraction-limited dielectric microcavities, their practical applications are hindered by large ohmic loss and Joule heating. Other than plasmonic materials, high-refractive-index dielectric nanocavities is a new way to trap light in subwavelength scales. However, studies on the interaction between dielectric nanocavities and excitons are still scarce. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that the Fano interference between molecular excitons and an individual silicon nanogroove can generate scattering dark modes. By placing J-aggregate excitons into a silicon nanogroove, the leaky magnetic resonant modes filling in the groove can tailor their scattering directivity and reduce the uncoupled radiation decay in a specific direction. This unidirectional &#8216;dark state&#8217; brings a new approach to tailor the interaction between excitons and nanocavities without large near-field enhancement. By adjusting the resonant modes, the scattering spectra can change from a Fano asymmetric line shape to a significantly suppressed scattering dip. These findings indicate that silicon nanogrooves can provide a platform for integrated on-chip silicon&#8211;exciton hybrid optical systems in the future.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Nanotechnology Research Center, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, Guangdong, China', 'authors': ['Jiahao Yan', ',\xa0Churong Ma', ',\xa0Pu Liu', ',\xa0Chengxin Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Guowei Yang']}]",True,"['Jiahao Yan', 'Churong Ma', 'Pu Liu', 'Chengxin Wang', 'Guowei Yang']","Yan, J., Ma, C., Liu, P. et al.

original article,Quantum dot vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers covering the 'green gap',"<p>Semiconductor vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) with wavelengths from 491.8 to 565.7&#8201;nm, covering most of the &#8216;green gap&#8217;, are demonstrated. For these lasers, the same quantum dot (QD) active region was used, whereas the wavelength was controlled by adjusting the cavity length, which is difficult for edge-emitting lasers. Compared with reports in the literature for green VCSELs, our lasers have set a few world records for the lowest threshold, longest wavelength and continuous-wave (CW) lasing at room temperature. The nanoscale QDs contribute dominantly to the low threshold. The emitting wavelength depends on the electron&#8211;photon interaction or the coupling between the active layer and the optical field, which is modulated by the cavity length. The green VCSELs exhibit a low-thermal resistance of 915&#8201;kW<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which benefits the CW lasing.

original article,Self-referenced photonic chip soliton Kerr frequency comb,"<p>Self-referencing turns pulsed laser systems into self-referenced frequency combs. Such frequency combs allow counting of optical frequencies and have a wide range of applications. The required optical bandwidth to implement self-referencing is typically obtained via nonlinear broadening in optical fibers. Recent advances in the field of Kerr frequency combs have provided a path toward the development of compact frequency comb sources that provide broadband frequency combs, exhibit microwave repetition rates and are compatible with on-chip photonic integration. These devices have the potential to significantly expand the use of frequency combs. Yet to date, self-referencing of such Kerr frequency combs has only been attained by applying conventional, fiber-based broadening techniques. Here we demonstrate external broadening-free self-referencing of a Kerr frequency comb. An optical spectrum spanning two-thirds of an octave is directly synthesized from a continuous wave laser-driven silicon nitride microresonator using temporal dissipative Kerr soliton formation and soliton Cherenkov radiation. Using this coherent bandwidth and two continuous wave transfer lasers in a 2f&#8211;3f self-referencing scheme, we are able to detect the offset frequency of the soliton Kerr frequency comb. By stabilizing the repetition rate to a radio frequency reference, the self-referenced frequency comb is used to count and track the continuous wave pump laser&#8217;s frequency.
