original article,Effects of edge on graphene plasmons as revealed by infrared nanoimaging,"<p>We used scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) to investigate the plasmonic properties of edges in well-defined graphene nanostructures, including sharp tapers, nanoribbons and nanogaps, which were all fabricated via the growth-etching chemical vapor deposition (GECVD) method. The obtained near-field images revealed the localized plasmon modes along the graphene nanoribbon; these modes strongly depended on the size of the graphene pattern, the angle of the tapered graphene and the infrared excitation wavelength. These interesting plasmon modes were verified by numerical simulations and explained by the reflection, and interference of electromagnetic waves at the graphene&#8211;SiO<sub>2</sub> edge. The constructive interference at the graphene nanogap caused by charge accumulation was demonstrated for the first time. Using the infrared nanoimaging technique, greater plasmon broadening was observed in the zigzag edge than in the armchair edge. Our study suggests that graphene edges should be separated by an effective working distance to avoid the overlapping of localized plasmon modes, which is very important for the design of graphene-based plasmonic circuits and devices.</p>",[],True,"[""Qingyang Xu"", ""Teng Ma"", ""Mohammad Danesh"", ""Bannur Nanjunda Shivananju"", ""Sheng Gan"", ""Jingchao Song"", ""Cheng-Wei Qiu"", ""Hui-Ming Cheng"", ""Wencai Ren"", ""Qiaoliang Bao""]","Xu, Q., Ma, T., Danesh, M. et al.

original article,Use of polarization freedom beyond polarization-division multiplexing to support high-speed and spectral-efficient data transmission,"<p>Increasing the system capacity and spectral efficiency (SE) per unit bandwidth is one of the ultimate goals for data network designers, especially when using technologies compatible with current embedded fiber infrastructures. Among these, the polarization-division-multiplexing (PDM) scheme, which supports two independent data channels on a single wavelength with orthogonal polarization states, has become a standard one in most state-of-art telecommunication systems. Currently, however, only two polarization states (that is, PDM) can be used, setting a barrier for further SE improvement. Assisted by coherent detection and digital signal processing, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for pseudo-PDM of four states (PPDM-4) by manipulation of four linearly polarized data channels with the same wavelength. Without any modification of the fiber link, we successfully transmit a 100-Gb&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> PPDM-4 differential-phase-shift-keying signal over a 150-km single-mode fiber link. Such a method is expected to open new possibilities to fully explore the use of polarization freedom for capacity and SE improvement over existing fiber systems.</p>",[],True,"[""Zhi-Yu Chen"", ""Lian-Shan Yan"", ""Yan Pan"", ""Lin Jiang"", ""An-Lin Yi"", ""Wei Pan"", ""Bin Luo""]","Chen, ZY., Yan, LS., Pan, Y. et al.

original article,Shaping the light amplified in a multimode fiber,"<p>Propagation of light in multimode optical fibers usually gives a spatial and temporal randomization of the transmitted field similar to the propagation through scattering media. Randomization still applies when scattering or multimode propagation occurs in gain media. We demonstrate that appropriate structuration of the input beam wavefront can shape the light amplified by a rare-earth-doped multimode fiber. Profiling of the wavefront was achieved by a deformable mirror in combination with an iterative optimization process. We present experimental results and simulations showing the shaping of a single sharp spot at different places in the output cross-section of an ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier. Cleaning and narrowing of the amplifier far-field pattern was realized as well. Tailoring the wavefront to shape the amplified light can also serve to improve the effective gain. The shaping approach still works under gain saturation, showing the robustness of the method. Modeling and experiments attest that the shaping is effective even with a highly multimode fiber amplifier carrying up to 127 modes.</p>",[],True,"[""Raphael Florentin"", ""Vincent Kermene"", ""Joel Benoist"", ""Agn\u00e8s Desfarges-Berthelemot"", ""Dominique Pagnoux"", ""Alain Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my"", ""Jean-Pierre Huignard""]","Florentin, R., Kermene, V., Benoist, J. et al.

original article,High-speed flow of interacting organic polaritons,"<p>The strong coupling of an excitonic transition with an electromagnetic mode results in composite quasi-particles called exciton polaritons, which have been shown to combine the best properties of their individual components in semiconductor microcavities. However, the physics and applications of polariton flows in organic materials and at room temperature are still unexplored because of the poor photon confinement in such structures. Here, we demonstrate that polaritons formed by the hybridization of organic excitons with a Bloch surface wave are able to propagate for hundreds of microns showing remarkable third-order nonlinear interactions upon high injection density. These findings pave the way for the study of organic nonlinear light&#8211;matter fluxes and for a technologically promising route of the realization of dissipation-less on-chip polariton devices operating at room temperature.</p>",[],True,"[""Giovanni Lerario"", ""Dario Ballarini"", ""Antonio Fieramosca"", ""Alessandro Cannavale"", ""Armando Genco"", ""Federica Mangione"", ""Salvatore Gambino"", ""Lorenzo Dominici"", ""Milena De Giorgi"", ""Giuseppe Gigli"", ""Daniele Sanvitto""]","Lerario, G., Ballarini, D., Fieramosca, A. et al.

original article,Color-selective holographic retroreflector array for sensing applications,"<p>Corner cube retroreflectors (CCRs) have applications in sensors, image processing, free space communication and wireless networks. The ability to construct low-loss wavelength filters embedded in CCRs can enable the development of wavelength multiplexing, tunable lasers and photonic integrated circuits. Here we created an ~10-&#956;m-thick holographic corner cube retroreflector (HCCR) array that acted as a color-selective wavelength filter and diffracted light at broad angles. Angle-resolved spectral measurements showed that the Bragg peak of the diffracted light from the HCCR array could be tuned from 460 to 545&#8201;nm by varying the incident angle. The HCCR array also exhibited a wavelength-selective tuning capability based on the rotation angle in the visible spectrum. HCCRs projected holographic images with the rotational property in the far field. The utility of the HCCR was demonstrated as optical temperature and relative humidity sensors that produced a visible colorimetric response for rapid diagnostics.</p>",[],True,"[""Rajib Ahmed"", ""Ali K Yetisen"", ""Seok Hyun Yun"", ""Haider Butt""]","Ahmed, R., Yetisen, A., Yun, S. et al.

original article,Simple route toward efficient frequency conversion for generation of fully coherent supercontinua in the mid-IR and UV range,"<p>Fiber supercontinua represent light sources of pivotal importance for a wide range of applications, ranging from optical communications to frequency metrology. Although spectra encompassing more than three octaves can be produced, the applicability of such spectra is strongly hampered due to coherence degradation during spectral broadening. Assuming pulse parameters at the cutting edge of currently available laser technology, we demonstrate the possibility of strongly coherent supercontinuum generation. In a fiber with two zero-dispersion wavelengths a higher-order soliton experiences a temporal breakdown, without any compression or splitting behavior, which leads to nearly complete conversion of input solitonic radiation into resonant nonsolitonic radiation in the dispersive wave regime. As the process is completely deterministic and shows little sensitivity to input noise, the resulting pulses appear to be compressible down to the sub-cycle level and may thus hold a new opportunity for direct generation of attosecond pulses in the visible to near ultraviolet wavelength range.</p>",[],True,"[""Ihar Babushkin"", ""Ayhan Tajalli"", ""Hakan Sayinc"", ""Uwe Morgner"", ""G\u00fcnter Steinmeyer"", ""Ayhan Demircan""]","Babushkin, I., Tajalli, A., Sayinc, H. et al.

original article,Exploiting scattering media for exploring 3D objects,"<p>Scattering media, such as diffused glass and biological tissue, are usually treated as obstacles in imaging. To cope with the random phase introduced by a turbid medium, most existing imaging techniques recourse to either phase compensation by optical means or phase recovery using iterative algorithms, and their applications are often limited to two-dimensional imaging. In contrast, we utilize the scattering medium as an unconventional imaging lens and exploit its lens-like properties for lensless three-dimensional (3D) imaging with diffraction-limited resolution. Our spatially incoherent lensless imaging technique is simple and capable of variable focusing with adjustable depths of focus that enables depth sensing of 3D objects that are concealed by the diffusing medium. Wide-field imaging with diffraction-limited resolution is verified experimentally by a single-shot recording of the 1951 USAF resolution test chart, and 3D imaging and depth sensing are demonstrated by shifting focus over axially separated objects.</p>",[],True,"[""Alok Kumar Singh"", ""Dinesh N Naik"", ""Giancarlo Pedrini"", ""Mitsuo Takeda"", ""Wolfgang Osten""]","Singh, A., Naik, D., Pedrini, G. et al.
