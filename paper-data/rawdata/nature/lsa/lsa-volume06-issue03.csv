original article,Photonic molecules with a tunable inter-cavity gap,"<p>Optical micro-resonators have broad applications. They are used, for example, to enhance light&#8211;matter interactions in optical sensors or as model systems for investigating fundamental physical mechanisms in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Coupling two or more micro-cavities is particularly interesting as it enlarges the design freedom and the field of application. In this context, achieving tunability of the coupling strength and hence the inter-cavity gap is of utmost importance for adjusting the properties of the coupled micro-resonator system. In this paper, we report on a novel coupling approach that allows highly precise tuning of the coupling gap of polymeric micro-resonators that are fabricated side by side on a common substrate. We structure goblet-shaped whispering-gallery-mode resonators on an elastic silicone-based polymer substrate by direct laser writing. The silicone substrate is mechanically stretched in order to exploit the lateral shrinkage to reduce the coupling gap. Incorporating a laser dye into the micro-resonators transforms the cavities into micro-lasers that can be pumped optically. We have investigated the lasing emission by micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy, focusing on the spatial localization of the modes. Our results demonstrate the formation of photonic molecules consisting of two or even three resonators, for which the coupling strengths and hence the lasing performance can be precisely tuned. Flexibility and tunability are key elements in future photonics, making our approach interesting for various photonic applications. For instance, as our coupling approach can also be extended to larger cavity arrays, it might serve as a platform for tunable coupled-resonator optical waveguide devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Applied Physics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, 76128, Germany', 'authors': ['Tobias Siegle', ',\xa0Stefan Schierle', ',\xa0Sarah Kraemmer', '\xa0&\xa0Heinz Kalt']}, {'address': 'Zoological Institute, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, 76128, Germany', 'authors': ['Benjamin Richter']}, {'address': 'Institute of Microstructure Technology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, 76128, Germany', 'authors': ['Sentayehu F Wondimu', ',\xa0Peter Schuch', '\xa0&\xa0Christian Koos']}, {'address': 'Institute of Photonics and Quantum Electronics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, 76128, Germany', 'authors': ['Sentayehu F Wondimu', '\xa0&\xa0Christian Koos']}]",True,"['Tobias Siegle', 'Stefan Schierle', 'Sarah Kraemmer', 'Benjamin Richter', 'Sentayehu F Wondimu', 'Peter Schuch', 'Christian Koos', 'Heinz Kalt']","Siegle, T., Schierle, S., Kraemmer, S. et al.

original article,Optical fiber meta-tips,"<p>We report on the first demonstration of a proof-of-principle optical fiber &#8216;meta-tip&#8217;, which integrates a phase-gradient plasmonic metasurface on the fiber tip. For illustration and validation purposes, we present numerical and experimental results pertaining to various prototypes implementing generalized forms of the Snell&#8217;s transmission/reflection laws at near-infrared wavelengths. In particular, we demonstrate several examples of beam steering and coupling with surface waves, in fairly good agreement with theory. Our results constitute a first step toward the integration of unprecedented (metasurface-enabled) light-manipulation capabilities in optical-fiber technology. By further enriching the emergent &#8216;lab-on-fiber&#8217; framework, this may pave the way for the widespread diffusion of optical metasurfaces in real-world applications to communications, signal processing, imaging and sensing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Optoelectronic Division, Department of Engineering, University of Sannio, Benevento, I-82100, Italy', 'authors': ['Maria Principe', ',\xa0Marco Consales', ',\xa0Alberto Micco', ',\xa0Antonello Cutolo', '\xa0&\xa0Andrea Cusano']}, {'address': 'Department of Engineering, Waves Group, University of Sannio, Benevento, I-82100, Italy', 'authors': ['Maria Principe', ',\xa0Giuseppe Castaldi', '\xa0&\xa0Vincenzo Galdi']}, {'address': 'Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems, National Research Council, Napoli, I-80131, Italy', 'authors': ['Alessio Crescitelli', '\xa0&\xa0Emanuela Esposito']}, {'address': 'UTTP-MDB, Materials and Devices, ENEAâ€”Portici Research Center, Portici, Napoli, I-80055, Italy', 'authors': ['Vera La Ferrara']}]",True,"['Maria Principe', 'Marco Consales', 'Alberto Micco', 'Alessio Crescitelli', 'Giuseppe Castaldi', 'Emanuela Esposito', 'Vera La Ferrara', 'Antonello Cutolo', 'Vincenzo Galdi', 'Andrea Cusano']","Principe, M., Consales, M., Micco, A. et al.

original article,Direct observation of Anderson localization in plasmonic terahertz devices,"<p>We present the first experimental observation of Anderson localization in the terahertz frequency range using plasmonic structures. To accomplish this goal, we designed THz waveguides consisting of a one-dimensional array of rectangular apertures that were fabricated in a freestanding metal foil. Disorder is introduced into the waveguide by offsetting the position of each aperture by a random distance within a prescribed range. For example, for a waveguide with apertures spaced by 250&#8201;&#956;m in a periodic waveguide, 10% disorder would correspond to the apertures being shifted by a random value between &#177;25&#8201;&#956;m along the waveguide axis. We find that for disorder levels below 25%, there is only an increase in the propagation loss along the device. However, for two specific waveguides with 25% disorder, we observe a spatially localized mode that lies just within the stop band of the device and exhibits a double-sided exponential spatial decay away from the maximum.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, 84112, UT, USA', 'authors': ['Shashank Pandey', ',\xa0Barun Gupta', '\xa0&\xa0Ajay Nahata']}, {'address': 'Tata Institute for Fundamental Research, Mumbai, 400005, India', 'authors': ['Sushil Mujumdar']}]",True,"['Shashank Pandey', 'Barun Gupta', 'Sushil Mujumdar', 'Ajay Nahata']","Pandey, S., Gupta, B., Mujumdar, S. et al.

original article,Rapid and robust control of single quantum dots,"<p>The combination of single particle detection and ultrafast laser pulses is an instrumental method to track dynamics at the femtosecond time scale in single molecules, quantum dots and plasmonic nanoparticles. Optimal control of the extremely short-lived coherences of these individual systems has so far remained elusive, yet its successful implementation would enable arbitrary external manipulation of otherwise inaccessible nanoscale dynamics. In ensemble measurements, such control is often achieved by resorting to a closed-loop optimization strategy, where the spectral phase of a broadband laser field is iteratively optimized. This scheme needs long measurement times and strong signals to converge to the optimal solution. This requirement is in conflict with the nature of single emitters whose signals are weak and unstable. Here we demonstrate an effective closed-loop optimization strategy capable of addressing single quantum dots at room temperature, using as feedback observable the two-photon photoluminescence induced by a phase-controlled broadband femtosecond laser. Crucial to the optimization loop is the use of a deterministic and robust-against-noise search algorithm converging to the theoretically predicted solution in a reduced amount of steps, even when operating at the few-photon level. Full optimization of the single dot luminescence is obtained within ~100 trials, with a typical integration time of 100&#8201;ms per trial. These times are faster than the typical photobleaching times in single molecules at room temperature. Our results show the suitability of the novel approach to perform closed-loop optimizations on single molecules, thus extending the available experimental toolbox to the active control of nanoscale coherences.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ICFO - Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Castelldefels (Barcelona), 08860, Spain', 'authors': ['NicolÃ² Accanto', ',\xa0Pablo M de Roque', '\xa0&\xa0Niek F van Hulst']}, {'address': 'Instituto de Ã“ptica-CSIC, Madrid, 28006, Spain', 'authors': ['Marcial Galvan-Sosa']}, {'address': 'Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, 16163, Italy', 'authors': ['Sotirios Christodoulou', '\xa0&\xa0Iwan Moreels']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Genova, Genova, 16146, Italy', 'authors': ['Sotirios Christodoulou']}, {'address': 'ICREA - InstituciÃ³ Catalana de Recerca i Estudis AvanÃ§ats, Barcelona, 08010, Spain', 'authors': ['Niek F van Hulst']}]",True,"['NicolÃ² Accanto', 'Pablo M de Roque', 'Marcial Galvan-Sosa', 'Sotirios Christodoulou', 'Iwan Moreels', 'Niek F van Hulst']","Accanto, N., de Roque, P., Galvan-Sosa, M. et al.

original article,Direct visualization of the complete evolution of femtosecond laser-induced surface structural dynamics of metals,"<p>Despite extensive studies of femtosecond laser-material interactions, even the simplest morphological responses following femtosecond pulse irradiation have not been fully resolved. Past studies have revealed only partial dynamics. Here we develop a zero-background and high-contrast scattered-light-based optical imaging technique through which we capture, for the first time, the complete temporal and spatial evolution of the femtosecond laser-induced morphological surface structural dynamics of metals from start to finish, that is, from the initial transient surface fluctuations, through melting and ablation, to the end of resolidification. We find that transient surface structures first appear at a delay time on the order of 100&#8201;ps, which is attributed to ablation driven by pressure relaxation in the surface layer. The formation dynamics of the surface structures at different length scales are individually resolved, and the sequence of their appearance changes with laser fluence is found. Cooling and complete resolidification, observed here for the first time, are shown to occur more slowly than previously predicted by two orders of magnitude. We examine and identify the mechanisms driving each of these dynamic steps. The visualization and control of morphological surface structural dynamics not only are of fundamental importance for understanding femtosecond laser-induced material responses but also pave the way for the design of new material functionalities through surface structuring.</p>",,"[{'address': 'The Institute of Optics, University of Rochester, Rochester, 14627, NY, USA', 'authors': ['Ranran Fang', ',\xa0Anatoliy Vorobyev', '\xa0&\xa0Chunlei Guo']}, {'address': 'The Guo China-US Photonics Laboratory, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, China', 'authors': ['Chunlei Guo']}]",True,"['Ranran Fang', 'Anatoliy Vorobyev', 'Chunlei Guo']","Fang, R., Vorobyev, A. & Guo, C.
