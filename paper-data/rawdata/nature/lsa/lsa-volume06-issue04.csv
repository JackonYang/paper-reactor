original article,Tomographic flow cytometry by digital holography,"<p>High-throughput single-cell analysis is a challenging task. Label-free tomographic phase microscopy is an excellent candidate to perform this task. However, in-line tomography is very difficult to implement in practice because it requires a complex set-up for rotating the sample and examining the cell along several directions. We demonstrate that by exploiting the random rolling of cells while they are flowing along a microfluidic channel, it is possible to obtain in-line phase-contrast tomography, if smart strategies for wavefront analysis are adopted. In fact, surprisingly, a priori knowledge of the three-dimensional position and orientation of rotating cells is no longer needed because this information can be completely retrieved through digital holography wavefront numerical analysis. This approach makes continuous-flow cytotomography suitable for practical operation in real-world, single-cell analysis and with a substantial simplification of the optical system; that is, no mechanical scanning or multi-direction probing is required. A demonstration is given for two completely different classes of biosamples: red blood cells and diatom algae. An accurate characterization of both types of cells is reported, despite their very different nature and material content, thus showing that the proposed method can be extended by adopting two alternate strategies of wavefront analysis to many classes of cells.</p>",[],True,"[""Francesco Merola"", ""Pasquale Memmolo"", ""Lisa Miccio"", ""Roberto Savoia"", ""Martina Mugnano"", ""Angelo Fontana"", ""Giuliana D'Ippolito"", ""Angela Sardo"", ""Achille Iolascon"", ""Antonella Gambale"", ""Pietro Ferraro""]","Merola, F., Memmolo, P., Miccio, L. et al.

original article,Beaming light from a quantum emitter with a planar optical antenna,"<p>The efficient interaction of light with quantum emitters is crucial to most applications in nano and quantum photonics, such as sensing or quantum information processing. Effective excitation and photon extraction are particularly important for the weak signals emitted by a single atom or molecule. Recent works have introduced novel collection strategies, which demonstrate that large efficiencies can be achieved by either planar dielectric antennas combined with high numerical aperture objectives or optical nanostructures that beam emission into a narrow angular distribution. However, the first approach requires the use of elaborate collection optics, while the latter is based on accurate positioning of the quantum emitter near complex nanoscale architectures; hence, sophisticated fabrication and experimental capabilities are needed. Here we present a theoretical and experimental demonstration of a planar optical antenna that beams light emitted by a single molecule, which results in increased collection efficiency at small angles without stringent requirements on the emitter position. The proposed device exhibits broadband performance and is spectrally scalable, and it is simple to fabricate and therefore applies to a wide range of quantum emitters. Our design finds immediate application in spectroscopy, quantum optics and sensing.</p>",[],True,"[""Simona Checcucci"", ""Pietro Lombardi"", ""Sahrish Rizvi"", ""Fabrizio Sgrignuoli"", ""Nico Gruhler"", ""Frederik BC Dieleman"", ""Francesco S Cataliotti"", ""Wolfram HP Pernice"", ""Mario Agio"", ""Costanza Toninelli""]","Checcucci, S., Lombardi, P., Rizvi, S. et al.

original article,Spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography visualizes multi-scale dynamics in mice,"<p>Imaging dynamics at different temporal and spatial scales is essential for understanding the biological complexity of living organisms, disease state and progression. Optoacoustic imaging has been shown to offer exclusive applicability across multiple scales with excellent optical contrast and high resolution in deep-tissue observations. Yet, efficient visualization of multi-scale dynamics remained difficult with state-of-the-art systems due to inefficient trade-offs between image acquisition time and effective field of view. Herein, we introduce the spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography technique that provides spectrally enriched high-resolution contrast across multiple spatiotemporal scales. In vivo experiments in mice demonstrate a wide range of dynamic imaging capabilities, from three-dimensional high-frame-rate visualization of moving organs and contrast agent kinetics in selected areas to whole-body longitudinal studies with unprecedented image quality. The newly introduced paradigm shift in imaging of multi-scale dynamics adds to the multifarious advantages provided by the optoacoustic technology for structural, functional and molecular imaging.</p>",[],True,"[""X Lu\u00eds De\u00e1n-Ben"", ""Thomas F Fehm"", ""Steven J Ford"", ""Sven Gottschalk"", ""Daniel Razansky""]","De√°n-Ben, X., Fehm, T., Ford, S. et al.

original article,Orbital angular momentum complex spectrum analyzer for vortex light based on the rotational Doppler effect,"<p>The ability to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) distribution of vortex light is essential for OAM applications. Although there have been many studies on the measurement of OAM modes, it is difficult to quantitatively and instantaneously measure the power distribution among different OAM modes, let alone measure the phase distribution among them. In this work, we propose an OAM complex spectrum analyzer that enables simultaneous measurements of the power and phase distributions of OAM modes by employing the rotational Doppler effect. The original OAM mode distribution is mapped to an electrical spectrum of beat signals using a photodetector. The power and phase distributions of superimposed OAM beams are successfully retrieved by analyzing the electrical spectrum. We also extend the measurement technique to other spatial modes, such as linear polarization modes. These results represent a new landmark in spatial mode analysis and show great potential for applications in OAM-based systems and optical communication systems with mode-division multiplexing.</p>",[],True,"[""Hai-Long Zhou"", ""Dong-Zhi Fu"", ""Jian-Ji Dong"", ""Pei Zhang"", ""Dong-Xu Chen"", ""Xin-Lun Cai"", ""Fu-Li Li"", ""Xin-Liang Zhang""]","Zhou, HL., Fu, DZ., Dong, JJ. et al.

original article,Second-harmonic-assisted four-wave mixing in chip-based microresonator frequency comb generation,"<p>Simultaneous Kerr comb formation and second-harmonic generation with on-chip microresonators can greatly facilitate comb self-referencing for optical clocks and frequency metrology. Moreover, the presence of both second- and third-order nonlinearities results in complex cavity dynamics that is of high scientific interest but is still far from being well-understood. Here, we demonstrate that the interaction between the fundamental and the second-harmonic waves can provide an entirely new way of phase matching for four-wave mixing in optical microresonators, enabling the generation of optical frequency combs in the normal dispersion regime under conditions where comb creation is ordinarily prohibited. We derive new coupled time-domain mean-field equations and obtain simulation results showing good qualitative agreement with our experimental observations. Our findings provide a novel way of overcoming the dispersion limit for simultaneous Kerr comb formation and second-harmonic generation, which might prove to be especially important in the near-visible to visible range where several atomic transitions commonly used for the stabilization of optical clocks are located and where the large normal material dispersion is likely to dominate.</p>",[],True,"[""Xiaoxiao Xue"", ""Fran\u00e7ois Leo"", ""Yi Xuan"", ""Jose A Jaramillo-Villegas"", ""Pei-Hsun Wang"", ""Daniel E Leaird"", ""Miro Erkintalo"", ""Minghao Qi"", ""Andrew M Weiner""]","Xue, X., Leo, F., Xuan, Y. et al.
