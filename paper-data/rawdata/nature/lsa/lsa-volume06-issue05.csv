original article,"Plasmonic enhancement and polarization dependence of nonlinear upconversion emissions from single gold nanorod@SiO2@CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ hybrid core–shell–satellite nanostructures","<p>Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) have recently become an attractive nonlinear fluorescence material for use in bioimaging because of their tunable spectral characteristics and exceptional photostability. Plasmonic materials are often introduced into the vicinity of UCNCs to increase their emission intensity by means of enlarging the absorption cross-section and accelerating the radiative decay rate. Moreover, plasmonic nanostructures (e.g., gold nanorods, GNRs) can also influence the polarization state of the UC fluorescence&#8212;an effect that is of fundamental importance for fluorescence polarization-based imaging methods yet has not been discussed previously. To study this effect, we synthesized GNR@SiO<sub>2</sub>@CaF<sub>2</sub>:Yb<sup>3+</sup>,Er<sup>3+</sup> hybrid core&#8211;shell&#8211;satellite nanostructures with precise control over the thickness of the SiO<sub>2</sub> shell. We evaluated the shell thickness-dependent plasmonic enhancement of the emission intensity in ensemble and studied the plasmonic modulation of the emission polarization at the single-particle level. The hybrid plasmonic UC nanostructures with an optimal shell thickness exhibit an improved bioimaging performance compared with bare UCNCs, and we observed a polarized nature of the light at both UC emission bands, which stems from the relationship between the excitation polarization and GNR orientation. We used electrodynamic simulations combined with F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer theory to fully explain the observed effect. Our results provide extensive insights into how the coherent interaction between the emission dipoles of UCNCs and the plasmonic dipoles of the GNR determines the emission polarization state in various situations and thus open the way to the accurate control of the UC emission anisotropy for a wide range of bioimaging and biosensing applications.</p>",[],True,"[""Jijun He"", ""Wei Zheng"", ""Filip Ligmajer"", ""Chi-Fai Chan"", ""Zhiyong Bao"", ""Ka-Leung Wong"", ""Xueyuan Chen"", ""Jianhua Hao"", ""Jiyan Dai"", ""Siu-Fung Yu"", ""Dang Yuan Lei""]","He, J., Zheng, W., Ligmajer, F. et al.

original article,Nanosphere lithography for optical fiber tip nanoprobes,"<p>This paper reports a simple and economical method for the fabrication of nanopatterned optical fiber nanotips. The proposed patterning approach relies on the use of the nanosphere lithography of the optical fiber end facet. Polystyrene (PS) nanospheres are initially self-assembled in a hexagonal array on the surface of water. The created pattern is then transferred onto an optical fiber tip (OFT). The PS monolayer colloidal crystal on the OFT is the basic building block that is used to obtain different periodic structures by applying further treatment to the fiber, such as metal coating, nanosphere size reduction and sphere removal. Ordered dielectric and metallo-dielectric sphere arrays, metallic nanoisland arrays and hole-patterned metallic films with feature sizes down to the submicron scale are achievable using this approach. Furthermore, the sizes and shapes of these periodic structures can be tailored by altering the fabrication conditions. The results indicate that the proposed self-assembly approach is a valuable route for the development of highly repeatable metallo-dielectric periodic patterns on OFTs with a high degree of order and low fabrication cost. The method can be easily extended to simultaneously produce multiple fibers, opening a new route to the development of fiber-optic nanoprobes. Finally, we demonstrate the effective application of the patterned OFTs as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy nanoprobes.</p>",[],True,"[""Marco Pisco"", ""Francesco Galeotti"", ""Giuseppe Quero"", ""Giorgio Grisci"", ""Alberto Micco"", ""Lucia V Mercaldo"", ""Paola Delli Veneri"", ""Antonello Cutolo"", ""Andrea Cusano""]","Pisco, M., Galeotti, F., Quero, G. et al.

original article,Red light at intensities above 10 lx alters sleep–wake behavior in mice,"<p>Sleep is regulated by two mechanisms: the homeostatic process and the circadian clock. Light affects sleep and alertness by entraining the circadian clock, and acutely inducing sleep/alertness, in a manner mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Because intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are believed to be minimally sensitive to red light, which is widely used for illumination to reduce the photic disturbance to nocturnal animals during the dark phase. However, the appropriate intensity of the red light is unknown. In the present study, we recorded electroencephalograms and electromyograms of freely moving mice to investigate the effects of red light emitted by light-emitting diodes at different intensities and for different durations on the sleep&#8211;wake behavior of mice. White light was used as a control. Unexpectedly, red light exerted potent sleep-inducing effects and changed the sleep architecture in terms of the duration and number of sleep episodes, the stage transition, and the EEG power density when the intensity was &gt;20&#8201;lx. Subsequently, we lowered the light intensity and demonstrated that red light at or below 10&#8201;lx did not affect sleep&#8211;wake behavior. White light markedly induced sleep and disrupted sleep architecture even at an intensity as low as 10&#8201;lx. Our findings highlight the importance of limiting the intensity of red light (&#10877;10&#8201;lx) to avoid optical influence in nocturnal behavioral experiments, particularly in the field of sleep and circadian research.</p>",[],True,"[""Ze Zhang"", ""Hui-Jing Wang"", ""Dian-Ru Wang"", ""Wei-Min Qu"", ""Zhi-Li Huang""]","Zhang, Z., Wang, HJ., Wang, DR. et al.

original article,"Scalable, ultra-resistant structural colors based on network metamaterials","<p>Structural colors have drawn wide attention for their potential as a future printing technology for various applications, ranging from biomimetic tissues to adaptive camouflage materials. However, an efficient approach to realize robust colors with a scalable fabrication technique is still lacking, hampering the realization of practical applications with this platform. Here, we develop a new approach based on large-scale network metamaterials that combine dealloyed subwavelength structures at the nanoscale with lossless, ultra-thin dielectric coatings. By using theory and experiments, we show how subwavelength dielectric coatings control a mechanism of resonant light coupling with epsilon-near-zero regions generated in the metallic network, generating the formation of saturated structural colors that cover a wide portion of the spectrum. Ellipsometry measurements support the efficient observation of these colors, even at angles of 70&#176;. The network-like architecture of these nanomaterials allows for high mechanical resistance, which is quantified in a series of nano-scratch tests. With such remarkable properties, these metastructures represent a robust design technology for real-world, large-scale commercial applications.</p>",[],True,"[""Henning Galinski"", ""Gael Favraud"", ""Hao Dong"", ""Juan S Totero Gongora"", ""Gr\u00e9gory Favaro"", ""Max D\u00f6beli"", ""Ralph Spolenak"", ""Andrea Fratalocchi"", ""Federico Capasso""]","Galinski, H., Favraud, G., Dong, H. et al.

original article,Quantification of light-enhanced ionic transport in lead iodide perovskite thin films and its solar cell applications,"<p>Ionic transport in organometal halide perovskites is of vital importance because it dominates anomalous phenomena in perovskite solar cells, from hysteresis to switchable photovoltaic effects. However, excited state ionic transport under illumination has remained elusive, although it is essential for understanding the unusual light-induced effects (light-induced self-poling, photo-induced halide segregation and slow photoconductivity response) in organometal halide perovskites for optoelectronic applications. Here, we quantitatively demonstrate light-enhanced ionic transport in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> over a wide temperature range of 17&#8211;295&#8201;K, which reveals a reduction in ionic transport activation energy by approximately a factor of five (from 0.82 to 0.15&#8201;eV) under illumination. The pure ionic conductance is obtained by separating it from the electronic contribution in cryogenic galvanostatic and voltage-current measurements. On the basis of these findings, we design a novel light-assisted method of catalyzing ionic interdiffusion between CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I and PbI<sub>2</sub> stacking layers in sequential deposition perovskite synthesis. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate a significant reduction of PbI<sub>2</sub> residue in the optimized CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> thin film produced via light-assisted sequential deposition, and the resulting solar cell efficiency is increased by over 100% (7.5%&#8211;15.7%) with little PbI<sub>2</sub> residue. This new method enables fine control of the reaction depth in perovskite synthesis and, in turn, supports light-enhanced ionic transport.</p>",[],True,"[""Yi-Cheng Zhao"", ""Wen-Ke Zhou"", ""Xu Zhou"", ""Kai-Hui Liu"", ""Da-Peng Yu"", ""Qing Zhao""]","Zhao, YC., Zhou, WK., Zhou, X. et al.

original article,Parametric down-conversion photon-pair source on a nanophotonic chip,"<p>Quantum-photonic chips, which integrate quantum light sources alongside active and passive optical elements, as well as single-photon detectors, show great potential for photonic quantum information processing and quantum technology. Mature semiconductor nanofabrication processes allow for scaling such photonic integrated circuits to on-chip networks of increasing complexity. Second-order nonlinear materials are the method of choice for generating photonic quantum states in the overwhelming majority of linear optic experiments using bulk components, but integration with waveguide circuitry on a nanophotonic chip proved to be challenging. Here, we demonstrate such an on-chip parametric down-conversion source of photon pairs based on second-order nonlinearity in an aluminum-nitride microring resonator. We show the potential of our source for quantum information processing by measuring the high visibility anti-bunching of heralded single photons with nearly ideal state purity. Our down-conversion source yields measured coincidence rates of 80&#8201;Hz, which implies MHz generation rates of correlated photon pairs. Low noise performance is demonstrated by measuring high coincidence-to-accidental ratios. The generated photon pairs are spectrally far separated from the pump field, providing great potential for realizing sufficient on-chip filtering and monolithic integration of quantum light sources, waveguide circuits and single-photon detectors.</p>",[],True,"[""Xiang Guo"", ""Chang-ling Zou"", ""Carsten Schuck"", ""Hojoong Jung"", ""Risheng Cheng"", ""Hong X Tang""]","Guo, X., Zou, Cl., Schuck, C. et al.

original article,Wide-field three-photon excitation in biological samples,"<p>Three-photon wide-field depth-resolved excitation is used to overcome some of the limitations in conventional point-scanning two- and three-photon microscopy. Excitation of chromophores as diverse as channelrhodopsins and quantum dots is shown, and a penetration depth of more than 700&#8201;&#956;m into fixed scattering brain tissue is achieved, approximately twice as deep as that achieved using two-photon wide-field excitation. Compatibility with live animal experiments is confirmed by imaging the cerebral vasculature of an anesthetized mouse; a complete focal stack was obtained without any evidence of photodamage. As an additional validation of the utility of wide-field three-photon excitation, functional excitation is demonstrated by performing three-photon optogenetic stimulation of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons expressing a channelrhodopsin; action potentials could reliably be excited without causing photodamage.</p>",[],True,"[""Christopher J Rowlands"", ""Demian Park"", ""Oliver T Bruns"", ""Kiryl D Piatkevich"", ""Dai Fukumura"", ""Rakesh K Jain"", ""Moungi G Bawendi"", ""Edward S Boyden"", ""Peter TC So""]","Rowlands, C., Park, D., Bruns, O. et al.

original article,Plasmon-assisted optical trapping and anti-trapping,"<p>The ability to manipulate small objects with focused laser beams has opened a venue for investigating dynamical phenomena relevant to both fundamental and applied science. Nanophotonic and plasmonic structures enable superior performance in optical trapping via highly confined near-fields. In this case, the interplay between the excitation field, re-scattered fields and the eigenmodes of a structure can lead to remarkable effects; one such effect, as reported here, is particle trapping by laser light in a vicinity of metal surface. Surface plasmon excitation at the metal substrate plays a key role in tailoring the optical forces acting on a nearby particle. Depending on whether the illuminating Gaussian beam is focused above or below the metal-dielectric interface, an order-of-magnitude enhancement or reduction of the trap stiffness is achieved compared with that of standard glass substrates. Furthermore, a novel plasmon-assisted anti-trapping effect (particle repulsion from the beam axis) is predicted and studied. A highly accurate particle sorting scheme based on the new anti-trapping effect is analyzed. The ability to distinguish and configure various electromagnetic channels through the developed analytical theory provides guidelines for designing auxiliary nanostructures and achieving ultimate control over mechanical motion at the micro- and nano-scales.</p>",[],True,"[""Aliaksandra Ivinskaya"", ""Mihail I Petrov"", ""Andrey A Bogdanov"", ""Ivan Shishkin"", ""Pavel Ginzburg"", ""Alexander S Shalin""]","Ivinskaya, A., Petrov, M., Bogdanov, A. et al.

original article,Generation of wavelength-independent subwavelength Bessel beams using metasurfaces,"<p>Bessel beams are of great interest due to their unique non-diffractive properties. Using a conical prism or an objective paired with an annular aperture are two typical approaches for generating zeroth-order Bessel beams. However, the former approach has a limited numerical aperture (NA), and the latter suffers from low efficiency, as most of the incident light is blocked by the aperture. Furthermore, an additional phase-modulating element is needed to generate higher-order Bessel beams, which in turn adds complexity and bulkiness to the system. We overcome these problems using dielectric metasurfaces to realize meta-axicons with additional functionalities not achievable with conventional means. We demonstrate meta-axicons with high NA up to 0.9 capable of generating Bessel beams with full width at half maximum about as small as ~&#955;/3 (&#955;=405&#8201;nm). Importantly, these Bessel beams have transverse intensity profiles independent of wavelength across the visible spectrum. These meta-axicons can enable advanced research and applications related to Bessel beams, such as laser fabrication, imaging and optical manipulation.</p>",[],True,"[""Wei Ting Chen"", ""Mohammadreza Khorasaninejad"", ""Alexander Y.

original article,A III-V-on-Si ultra-dense comb laser,"<p>Optical frequency combs emerge as a promising technology that enables highly sensitive, near-real-time spectroscopy with a high resolution. The currently available comb generators are mostly based on bulky and high-cost femtosecond lasers for dense comb generation (line spacing in the range of 100&#8201;MHz to 1&#8201;GHz). However, their integrated and low-cost counterparts, which are integrated semiconductor mode-locked lasers, are limited by their large comb spacing, small number of lines and broad optical linewidth. In this study, we report a demonstration of a III-V-on-Si comb laser that can function as a compact, low-cost frequency comb generator after frequency stabilization. The use of low-loss passive silicon waveguides enables the integration of a long laser cavity, which enables the laser to be locked in the passive mode at a record-low 1&#8201;GHz repetition rate. The 12-nm 10-dB output optical spectrum and the notably small optical mode spacing results in a dense optical comb that consists of over 1400 equally spaced optical lines. The sub-kHz 10-dB radio frequency linewidth and the narrow longitudinal mode linewidth (&lt;400&#8201;kHz) indicate notably stable mode-locking. Such integrated dense comb lasers are very promising, for example, for high-resolution and real-time spectroscopy applications.</p>",[],True,"[""Zhechao Wang"", ""Kasper Van Gasse"", ""Valentina Moskalenko"", ""Sylwester Latkowski"", ""Erwin Bente"", ""Bart Kuyken"", ""Gunther Roelkens""]","Wang, Z., Van Gasse, K., Moskalenko, V. et al.A III-V-on-Si ultra-dense comb laser.

original article,Directional coherent light via intensity-induced sideband emission,"<p>We introduce a unique technique for generating directional coherent emissions that could be utilized to create coherent sources in a wide range of frequencies from the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) to the deep infrared. This is accomplished without population inversion by pumping a two-level system with a far-detuned strong optical field that induces the splitting of the two-level system. A nonlinear process of four-wave mixing then occurs across the split system, driving coherent emission at sidebands both red- and blue-detuned from the pump frequency, and propagates both forward and backward along the pump beam path. We observed this phenomenon in dense rubidium vapor along both the D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> transitions. The sideband emission exhibits a short pulse duration (&lt;1&#8201;ns) with threshold-like behavior dependent on both the pump intensity and Rb vapor density. This technique offers a new capability for manipulating the emission frequency simply through intensity-induced atomic modulation that can be scaled to most frequency regimes using various atomic/molecular ensembles and pump energies.</p>",[],True,"[""Andrew J Traverso"", ""Chris O'Brien"", ""Brett H Hokr"", ""Jonathan V Thompson"", ""Luqi Yuan"", ""Charles W Ballmann"", ""Anatoly A Svidzinsky"", ""Georgi I Petrov"", ""Marlan O Scully"", ""Vladislav V Yakovlev""]","Traverso, A., O'Brien, C., Hokr, B. et al.
