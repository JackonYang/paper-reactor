original article,Hot electrons in water: injection and ponderomotive acceleration by means of plasmonic nanoelectrodes,"<p>We present a theoretical and experimental study of a plasmonic nanoelectrode architecture that is able to inject bunches of hot electrons into an aqueous environment. In this approach, electrons are accelerated in water by ponderomotive forces up to energies capable of exciting or ionizing water molecules. This ability is enabled by the nanoelectrode structure (extruding out of a metal baseplate), which allows for the production of an intense plasmonic hot spot at the apex of the structure while maintaining the electrical connection to a virtually unlimited charge reservoir. The electron injection is experimentally monitored by recording the current transmitted through the water medium, whereas the electron acceleration is confirmed by observation of the bubble generation for a laser power exceeding a proper threshold. An understanding of the complex physics involved is obtained via a numerical approach that explicitly models the electromagnetic hot spot generation, electron-by-electron injection via multiphoton absorption, acceleration by ponderomotive forces and electron-water interaction through random elastic and inelastic scattering. The model predicts a critical electron density for bubble nucleation that nicely matches the experimental findings and reveals that the efficiency of energy transfer from the plasmonic hot spot to the free electron cloud is much more efficient (17 times higher) in water than in a vacuum. Because of their high kinetic energy and large reduction potential, these proposed wet hot electrons may provide new opportunities in photocatalysis, electrochemical processes and hot-electron driven chemistry.</p>",[],True,"[""Pierfrancesco Zilio"", ""Michele Dipalo"", ""Francesco Tantussi"", ""Gabriele C Messina"", ""Francesco de Angelis""]","Zilio, P., Dipalo, M., Tantussi, F. et al.

original article,Multi-chromatic silicon nanocrystals,"<p>Silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have great potential to become environmental friendly alternatives to heavy-metal containing nanocrystals for applications including medical imaging, lighting and displays. SiNCs exhibit excellent photostability, non-toxicity and abundant resources, but their often reported inefficient and spectrally limited light emission seriously impair their applications. Here we demonstrate a new method that converts SiNCs into an efficient and robust multi-chromatic phosphor. Using ~15&#8201;keV electron-beam irradiation of oxide-capped SiNCs, we introduce several types of color centers into the nanocrystal&#8217;s oxide shell with efficient blue, green and red emission bands, together yielding warm-white photoluminescence, even for a single SiNC. Introduced centers are not native to the original system and we relate them to known defects in silica. Unlike in the silica host, however, here the centers are efficiently optically excitable. Provided further optimization and up-scaling of this method, e-beam irradiated SiNCs can be of great interest as white phosphors for applications such as LEDs.</p>",[],True,"[""Benjamin Bruhn"", ""Benjamin JM Brenny"", ""Sidoeri Dekker"", ""Ilker Do\u011fan"", ""Peter Schall"", ""Katerina Dohnalov\u00e1""]","Bruhn, B., Brenny, B., Dekker, S. et al.

original article,Universal switching of plasmonic signals using optical resonator modes,"<p>We propose and investigate, both experimentally and theoretically, a novel mechanism for switching and modulating plasmonic signals based on a Fano interference process, which arises from the coupling between a narrow-band optical Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity and a surface plasmon polariton (SPP) source. The SPP wave emitted from the cavity is actively modulated in the vicinity of the cavity resonances by altering the cavity Q-factor and/or resonant frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate dynamic SPP modulation both by mechanical control of the cavity length and all-optically by harnessing the ultrafast nonlinearity of the Au mirrors that form the cavity. An electro-optical modulation scheme is also proposed and numerically illustrated. Dynamic operation of the switch via mechanical means yields a modulation in the SPP coupling efficiency of ~80%, while the all-optical control provides an ultrafast modulation with an efficiency of 30% at a rate of ~0.6&#8201;THz. The experimental observations are supported by both analytical and numerical calculations of the mechanical, all-optical and electro-optical modulation methods.</p>",[],True,"[""Cillian PT McPolin"", ""Nicolas Olivier"", ""Jean-Sebastien Bouillard"", ""Daniel O'Connor"", ""Alexey V Krasavin"", ""Wayne Dickson"", ""Gregory A Wurtz"", ""Anatoly V Zayats""]","McPolin, C., Olivier, N., Bouillard, JS. et al.

original article,Reconfigurable metasurfaces that enable light polarization control by light,"<p>Plasmonic metasurfaces have recently attracted much attention because of their novel characteristics with respect to light polarization and wave front control on deep-subwavelength scales. The development of metasurfaces with reconfigurable optical responses is opening new opportunities in high-capacity communications, real-time holograms and adaptive optics. Such tunable devices have been developed in the mid-infrared spectral range and operated in light intensity modulation schemes. Here we present a novel optically reconfigurable hybrid metasurface that enables polarization tuning at optical frequencies. The functionality of tuning is realized by switching the coupling conditions between the plasmonic modes and the binary isomeric states of an ethyl red switching layer upon light stimulation. We achieved more than 20&#176; nonlinear changes in the transmitted polarization azimuth using just 4&#8201;mW of switching light power. Such design schemes and principles could be easily applied to dynamically adjust the functionalities of other metasurfaces.</p>",[],True,"[""Meng-Xin Ren"", ""Wei Wu"", ""Wei Cai"", ""Biao Pi"", ""Xin-Zheng Zhang"", ""Jing-Jun Xu""]","Ren, MX., Wu, W., Cai, W. et al.

original article,Quantifying backflash radiation to prevent zero-error attacks in quantum key distribution,"<p>Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are the most widespread commercial solution for single-photon counting in quantum key distribution applications. However, the secondary photon emission that arises from the avalanche of charge carriers that occurs during the detection of a photon may be exploited by an eavesdropper to gain information without inducing errors in the transmission key. In this paper, we characterize such backflash light in gated InGaAs/InP SPADs and discuss its spectral and temporal characterization for different detector models and different operating parameters. We qualitatively bound the maximum information leakage due to backflash light and propose solutions for preventing such leakage.</p>",[],True,"[""Alice Meda"", ""Ivo Pietro Degiovanni"", ""Alberto Tosi"", ""Zhiliang Yuan"", ""Giorgio Brida"", ""Marco Genovese""]","Meda, A., Degiovanni, I., Tosi, A. et al.

original article,Hybrid remote quantum dot/powder phosphor designs for display backlights,"<p>Quantum dots are ideally suited for color conversion in light emitting diodes owing to their spectral tunability, high conversion efficiency and narrow emission bands. These properties are particularly important for display backlights; the highly saturated colors generated by quantum dots justify their higher production cost. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of a hybrid remote phosphor approach that combines a green-emitting europium-doped phosphor with red-emitting CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots. Different stacking geometries, including mixed and separate layers of both materials, are studied at the macroscopic and microscopic levels to identify the configuration that achieves maximum device efficiency while minimizing material usage. The influence of reabsorption, optical outcoupling and refractive index-matching between the layers is evaluated in detail with respect to device efficiency and cost. From the findings of this study, general guidelines are derived to optimize both the cost and efficiency of CdSe/CdS and other (potentially cadmium-free) quantum dot systems. When reabsorption of the green and/or red emission is significant compared to the absorption strength for the blue emission of the pumping light emitting diode, the hybrid remote phosphor approach becomes beneficial.</p>",[],True,"[""Sofie Abe"", ""Jonas J Joos"", ""Lisa IDJ Martin"", ""Zeger Hens"", ""Philippe F Smet""]","Abe, S., Joos, J., Martin, L. et al.

original article,Spontaneous emission in non-local materials,"<p>Light&#8211;matter interactions can be strongly modified by the surrounding environment. Here, we report on the first experimental observation of molecular spontaneous emission inside a highly non-local metamaterial based on a plasmonic nanorod assembly. We show that the emission process is dominated not only by the topology of its local effective medium dispersion, but also by the non-local response of the composite, so that metamaterials with different geometric parameters but the same local effective medium properties exhibit different Purcell factors. A record-high enhancement of a decay rate is observed, in agreement with the developed quantitative description of the Purcell effect in a non-local medium. An engineered material non-locality introduces an additional degree of freedom into quantum electrodynamics, enabling new applications in quantum information processing, photochemistry, imaging and sensing with macroscopic composites.</p>",[],True,"[""Pavel Ginzburg"", ""Diane J Roth"", ""Mazhar E Nasir"", ""Paulina Segovia"", ""Alexey V Krasavin"", ""James Levitt"", ""Liisa M Hirvonen"", ""Brian Wells"", ""Klaus Suhling"", ""David Richards"", ""Viktor A Podolskiy"", ""Anatoly V Zayats""]","Ginzburg, P., Roth, D., Nasir, M. et al.

original article,Broadband spin Hall effect of light in single nanoapertures,"<p>With properties not previously available, optical metamaterials and metasurfaces have shown their great potential in the precise control of light waves at the nanoscale. However, the use of current metamaterials and metasurfaces is limited by the collective response of the meta-atoms/molecules, which means that a single element cannot provide the functionalities required by most applications. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a single achiral nanoaperture can be utilized as a meta-macromolecule to achieve giant angular spin Hall effect of light. By controlling the spin-related momenta, we show that these nanoapertures can enable full control of the phase gradient at a deep-subwavelength level, thus forming unique building blocks for optical metasurfaces. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a miniaturized Bessel-like beam generator and flat lens are designed and experimentally characterized. The results presented here may open a door for the development of meta-macromolecule-based metasurfaces for integrated optical systems and nanophotonics.</p>",[],True,"[""Xian-Gang Luo"", ""Ming-Bo Pu"", ""Xiong Li"", ""Xiao-Liang Ma""]","Luo, XG., Pu, MB., Li, X. et al.

original article,Double-layer graphene for enhanced tunable infrared plasmonics,"<p>Graphene is emerging as a promising material for photonic applications owing to its unique optoelectronic properties. Graphene supports tunable, long-lived and extremely confined plasmons that have great potential for applications such as biosensing and optical communications. However, in order to excite plasmonic resonances in graphene, this material requires a high doping level, which is challenging to achieve without degrading carrier mobility and stability. Here, we demonstrate that the infrared plasmonic response of a graphene multilayer stack is analogous to that of a highly doped single layer of graphene, preserving mobility and supporting plasmonic resonances with higher oscillator strength than previously explored single-layer devices. Particularly, we find that the optically equivalent carrier density in multilayer graphene is larger than the sum of those in the individual layers. Furthermore, electrostatic biasing in multilayer graphene is enhanced with respect to single layer due to the redistribution of carriers over different layers, thus extending the spectral tuning range of the plasmonic structure. The superior effective doping and improved tunability of multilayer graphene stacks should enable a plethora of future infrared plasmonic devices with high optical performance and wide tunability.</p>",[],True,"[""Daniel Rodrigo"", ""Andreas Tittl"", ""Odeta Limaj"", ""F Javier Garc\u00eda de Abajo"", ""Valerio Pruneri"", ""Hatice Altug""]","Rodrigo, D., Tittl, A., Limaj, O. et al.
