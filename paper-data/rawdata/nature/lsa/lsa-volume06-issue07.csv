original article,Realization of the first sub-shot-noise wide field microscope,"<p>Recently, several proof of principle experiments have demonstrated the advantages of quantum technologies over classical schemes. The present challenge is to surpass the limits of proof of principle demonstrations to approach real applications. This letter presents such an achievement in the field of quantum enhanced imaging. In particular, we describe the realization of a sub-shot-noise wide field microscope based on spatially multi-mode non-classical photon number correlations in twin beams. The microscope produces realtime images of 8000 pixels at full resolution, for a 500&#8201;&#956;m<sup>2</sup> field of view, with noise reduced to 80% of the shot noise level (for each pixel), which is suitable for absorption imaging of complex structures. By fast post-elaboration, specifically applying a quantum enhanced median filter, the noise can be further reduced (to &lt;30% of the shot noise level) by setting a trade-off with the resolution, thus achieving the best sensitivity per incident photon reported in absorption microscopy.</p>",[],True,"[""Nigam Samantaray"", ""Ivano Ruo-Berchera"", ""Alice Meda"", ""Marco Genovese""]","Samantaray, N., Ruo-Berchera, I., Meda, A. et al.

original article,Three-dimensional chiral microstructures fabricated by structured optical vortices in isotropic material,"<p>Optical vortices, a type of structured beam with helical phase wavefronts and &#8216;doughnut&#8217;-shaped intensity distributions, have been used to fabricate chiral structures in metals and spiral patterns in anisotropic polarization-dependent azobenzene polymers. However, in isotropic polymers, the fabricated microstructures are typically confined to non-chiral cylindrical geometry due to the two-dimensional &#8216;doughnut&#8217;-shaped intensity profile of the optical vortices. Here we develop a powerful strategy to realize chiral microstructures in isotropic material by coaxial interference of a vortex beam and a plane wave, which produces three-dimensional (3D) spiral optical fields. These coaxial interference beams are generated by designing contrivable holograms consisting of an azimuthal phase and an equiphase loaded on a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator. In isotropic polymers, 3D chiral microstructures are achieved under illumination using coaxial interference femtosecond laser beams with their chirality controlled by the topological charge. Our further investigation reveals that the spiral lobes and chirality are caused by interfering patterns and helical phase wavefronts, respectively. This technique is simple, stable and easy to perform, and it offers broad applications in optical tweezers, optical communications and fast metamaterial fabrication.</p>",[],True,"[""Jincheng Ni"", ""Chaowei Wang"", ""Chenchu Zhang"", ""Yanlei Hu"", ""Liang Yang"", ""Zhaoxin Lao"", ""Bing Xu"", ""Jiawen Li"", ""Dong Wu"", ""Jiaru Chu""]","Ni, J., Wang, C., Zhang, C. et al.

original article,Digital spiral object identification using random light,"<p>Photons that are entangled or correlated in orbital angular momentum have been extensively used for remote sensing, object identification and imaging. It has recently been demonstrated that intensity fluctuations give rise to the formation of correlations in the orbital angular momentum components and angular positions of random light. Here we demonstrate that the spatial signatures and phase information of an object with rotational symmetries can be identified using classical orbital angular momentum correlations in random light. The Fourier components imprinted in the digital spiral spectrum of the object, as measured through intensity correlations, unveil its spatial and phase information. Sharing similarities with conventional compressive sensing protocols that exploit sparsity to reduce the number of measurements required to reconstruct a signal, our technique allows sensing of an object with fewer measurements than other schemes that use pixel-by-pixel imaging. One remarkable advantage of our technique is that it does not require the preparation of fragile quantum states of light and operates at both low- and high-light levels. In addition, our technique is robust against environmental noise, a fundamental feature of any realistic scheme for remote sensing.</p>",[],True,"[""Zhe Yang"", ""Omar S Maga\u00f1a-Loaiza"", ""Mohammad Mirhosseini"", ""Yiyu Zhou"", ""Boshen Gao"", ""Lu Gao"", ""Seyed Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani"", ""Gui-Lu Long"", ""Robert W Boyd""]","Yang, Z., Magaña-Loaiza, O., Mirhosseini, M. et al.

original article,Scalable and controlled self-assembly of aluminum-based random plasmonic metasurfaces,"<p>Subwavelength metal-dielectric plasmonic metasurfaces enable light management beyond the diffraction limit. However, a cost-effective and reliable fabrication method for such structures remains a major challenge hindering their full exploitation. Here, we propose a simple yet powerful manufacturing route for plasmonic metasurfaces based on a bottom-up approach. The fabricated metasurfaces consist of a dense distribution of randomly oriented nanoscale scatterers composed of aluminum (Al) nanohole-disk pairs, which exhibit angle-independent scattering that is tunable across the entire visible spectrum. The macroscopic response of the metasurfaces is controlled via the properties of an isolated Al nanohole-disk pair at the nanoscale. In addition, the optical field confinement at the scatterers and their random distribution of sizes result in a strongly enhanced Raman signal that enables broadly tunable excitation using a single substrate. This unique combination of a reliable and lithography-free methodology with the use of aluminum permits the exploitation of the full potential of random plasmonic metasurfaces for diagnostics and coloration.</p>",[],True,"[""Radwanul Hasan Siddique"", ""Jan Mertens"", ""Hendrik H\u00f6lscher"", ""Silvia Vignolini""]","Siddique, R., Mertens, J., Hölscher, H. et al.

original article,Beam switching and bifocal zoom lensing using active plasmonic metasurfaces,"<p>Compact nanophotonic elements exhibiting adaptable properties are essential components for the miniaturization of powerful optical technologies such as adaptive optics and spatial light modulators. While the larger counterparts typically rely on mechanical actuation, this can be undesirable in some cases on a microscopic scale due to inherent space restrictions. Here, we present a novel design concept for highly integrated active optical components that employs a combination of resonant plasmonic metasurfaces and the phase-change material Ge<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>.

original article,Fano-resonance-assisted metasurface for color routing,"<p>Controlling the phase of an electromagnetic field using plasmonic nanostructures provides a versatile way to manipulate light at the nanoscale. Broadband phase modulation has been demonstrated using inhomogeneous metasurfaces with different geometries; however, for many applications such as filtering, hyperspectral imaging and color holography, narrowband frequecy selectivity is a key functionality. In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, a narrowband metasurface that relies on Fano resonances to control the propagation of light. By geometrically tuning the sub-radiant modes with respect to a fixed super-radiant resonance, we can create a phase modulation along the surface within a narrow spectral range. The resulting anomalous reflection measured for such a Fano-resonant metasurface exhibits a 100&#8201;nm bandwidth and a color routing efficiency of up to 81% at a central wavelength of &#955;=750&#8201;nm. The design flexibility provided by this Fano-assisted metasurface for color-selective light manipulation is further illustrated by demonstrating a highly directional color-routing effect between two channels, at &#955;=532 and 660&#8201;nm, without any crosstalk.</p>",[],True,"[""Chen Yan"", ""Kuang-Yu Yang"", ""Olivier J F Martin""]","Yan, C., Yang, KY. & Martin, O.
