original article,Few-mode fibre-optic microwave photonic links,"<p>The fibre-optic microwave photonic link has become one of the basic building blocks for microwave photonics. Increasing the optical power at the receiver is the best way to improve all link performance metrics including gain, noise figure and dynamic range. Even though lasers can produce and photodetectors can receive optical powers on the order of a Watt or more, the power-handling capability of optical fibres is orders-of-magnitude lower. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate the use of few-mode fibres to bridge this power-handling gap, exploiting their unique features of small acousto-optic effective area, large effective areas of optical modes, as well as orthogonality and walk-off among spatial modes. Using specially designed few-mode fibres, we demonstrate order-of-magnitude improvements in link performances for single-channel and multiplexed transmission. This work represents the first step in few-mode microwave photonics. The spatial degrees of freedom can also offer other functionalities such as large, tunable delays based on modal dispersion and wavelength-independent lossless signal combining, which are indispensable in microwave photonics.</p>",[],True,"[""He Wen"", ""Hongjun Zheng"", ""Qi Mo"", ""Amado Manuel Vel\u00e1zquez-Ben\u00edtez"", ""Cen Xia"", ""Bin Huang"", ""Huiyuan Liu"", ""Huang Yu"", ""Pierre Sillard"", ""Jose Enrique Antonio Lopez"", ""Rodrigo Amezcua Correa"", ""Guifang Li""]","Wen, H., Zheng, H., Mo, Q. et al.

original article,Ultrasensitive broadband phototransistors based on perovskite/organic-semiconductor vertical heterojunctions,"<p>Organolead halide perovskites have emerged as the most promising materials for various optoelectronic devices, especially solar cells, because of their excellent optoelectronic properties. Here, we present the first report of low-voltage high-gain phototransistors based on perovskite/organic-semiconductor vertical heterojunctions, which show ultrahigh responsivities of ~10<sup>9</sup>A&#160;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup> and specific detectivities of ~10<sup>14</sup> Jones in a broadband region from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. The high sensitivity of the devices is attributed to a pronounced photogating effect that is mainly due to the long carrier lifetimes and strong light absorption in the perovskite material. In addition, flexible perovskite photodetectors have been successfully prepared via a solution process and show high sensitivity as well as excellent flexibility and bending durability. The high performance and facile solution-based fabrication of the perovskite/organic-semiconductor phototransistors indicate their promise for potential application for ultrasensitive broadband photodetection.</p>",[],True,"[""Chao Xie"", ""Peng You"", ""Zhike Liu"", ""Li Li"", ""Feng Yan""]","Xie, C., You, P., Liu, Z. et al.

original article,Multifunctional interleaved geometric-phase dielectric metasurfaces,"<p>Shared-aperture technology for multifunctional planar systems, performing several simultaneous tasks, was first introduced in the field of radar antennas. In photonics, effective control of the electromagnetic response can be achieved by a geometric-phase mechanism implemented within a metasurface, enabling spin-controlled phase modulation. The synthesis of the shared-aperture and geometric-phase concepts facilitates the generation of multifunctional metasurfaces. Here shared-aperture geometric-phase metasurfaces were realized via the interleaving of sparse antenna sub-arrays, forming Si-based devices consisting of multiplexed geometric-phase profiles. We study the performance limitations of interleaved nanoantenna arrays by means of a Wigner phase-space distribution to establish the ultimate information capacity of a metasurface-based photonic system. Within these limitations, we present multifunctional spin-dependent dielectric metasurfaces, and demonstrate multiple-beam technology for optical rotation sensing. We also demonstrate the possibility of achieving complete real-time control and measurement of the fundamental, intrinsic properties of light, including frequency, polarization and orbital angular momentum.</p>",[],True,"[""Elhanan Maguid"", ""Igor Yulevich"", ""Michael Yannai"", ""Vladimir Kleiner"", ""Mark L Brongersma"", ""Erez Hasman""]","Maguid, E., Yulevich, I., Yannai, M. et al.

original article,Nanoplasmonic mid-infrared biosensor for in vitro protein secondary structure detection,"<p>Plasmonic nanoantennas offer new applications in mid-infrared (mid-IR) absorption spectroscopy with ultrasensitive detection of structural signatures of biomolecules, such as proteins, due to their strong resonant near-fields. The amide I fingerprint of a protein contains conformational information that is greatly important for understanding its function in health and disease. Here, we introduce a non-invasive, label-free mid-IR nanoantenna-array sensor for secondary structure identification of nanometer-thin protein layers in aqueous solution by resolving the content of plasmonically enhanced amide I signatures. We successfully detect random coil to cross &#946;-sheet conformational changes associated with &#945;-synuclein protein aggregation, a detrimental process in many neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate high conformational sensitivity by differentiating subtle secondary-structural variations in a native &#946;-sheet protein monolayer from those of cross &#946;-sheets, which are characteristic of pathological aggregates. Our nanoplasmonic biosensor is a highly promising and versatile tool for in vitro structural analysis of thin protein layers.</p>",[],True,"[""Dordaneh Etezadi"", ""John B Warner IV"", ""Francesco S Ruggeri"", ""Giovanni Dietler"", ""Hilal A Lashuel"", ""Hatice Altug""]","Etezadi, D., Warner IV, J., Ruggeri, F. et al.

original article,Emission from quantum-dot high-β microcavities: transition from spontaneous emission to lasing and the effects of superradiant emitter coupling,"<p>Measured and calculated results are presented for the emission properties of a new class of emitters operating in the cavity quantum electrodynamics regime. The structures are based on high-finesse GaAs/AlAs micropillar cavities, each with an active medium consisting of a layer of InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) and the distinguishing feature of having a substantial fraction of spontaneous emission channeled into one cavity mode (high &#946;-factor). This paper demonstrates that the usual criterion for lasing with a conventional (low &#946;-factor) cavity, that is, a sharp non-linearity in the input&#8211;output curve accompanied by noticeable linewidth narrowing, has to be reinforced by the equal-time second-order photon autocorrelation function to confirm lasing. The paper also shows that the equal-time second-order photon autocorrelation function is useful for recognizing superradiance, a manifestation of the correlations possible in high-&#946; microcavities operating with QDs. In terms of consolidating the collected data and identifying the physics underlying laser action, both theory and experiment suggest a sole dependence on intracavity photon number. Evidence for this assertion comes from all our measured and calculated data on emission coherence and fluctuation, for devices ranging from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and cavity-enhanced LEDs to lasers, lying on the same two curves: one for linewidth narrowing versus intracavity photon number and the other for g<sup>(2)</sup>(0) versus intracavity photon number.</p>",[],True,"[""S\u00f6ren Kreinberg"", ""Weng W Chow"", ""Janik Wolters"", ""Christian Schneider"", ""Christopher Gies"", ""Frank Jahnke"", ""Sven H\u00f6fling"", ""Martin Kamp"", ""Stephan Reitzenstein""]","Kreinberg, S., Chow, W., Wolters, J. et al.

original article,Three-dimensional super-resolution longitudinal magnetization spot arrays,"<p>We demonstrate an all-optical strategy for realizing spherical three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (&#8764;&#955;<sup>3</sup>/22) spot arrays of pure longitudinal magnetization by exploiting a 4&#960; optical microscopic setup with two high numerical aperture (NA) objective lenses, which focus and interfere two modulated vectorial beams. Multiple phase filters (MPFs) are designed via an analytical approach derived from the vectorial Debye diffraction theory to modulate the two circularly polarized beams. The system is tailored to constructively interfere the longitudinal magnetization components, while simultaneously destructively interfering the azimuthal ones. As a result, the magnetization field is not only purely longitudinal but also super-resolved in all three dimensions. Furthermore, the MPFs can be designed analytically to control the number and locations of the super-resolved magnetization spots to produce both uniform and nonuniform arrays in a 3D volume. Thus, an all-optical control of all the properties of light-induced magnetization spot arrays has been demonstrated for the first time. These results open up broad applications in magnetic-optical devices such as confocal and multifocal magnetic resonance microscopy, 3D ultrahigh-density magneto-optic memory, and light-induced magneto-lithography.</p>",[],True,"[""Zhong-Quan Nie"", ""Han Lin"", ""Xiao-Fei Liu"", ""Ai-Ping Zhai"", ""Yan-Ting Tian"", ""Wen-Jie Wang"", ""Dong-Yu Li"", ""Wei-Qiang Ding"", ""Xue-Ru Zhang"", ""Ying-Lin Song"", ""Bao-Hua Jia""]","Nie, ZQ., Lin, H., Liu, XF. et al.

original article,Direct observation of localized surface plasmon field enhancement by Kelvin probe force microscopy,"<p>A surface plasmon (SP) is a fundamental excitation state that exists in metal nanostructures. Over the past several years, the performance of optoelectronic devices has been improved greatly via the SP enhancement effect. In our previous work, the responsivity of GaN ultraviolet detectors was increased by over 30 times when using Ag nanoparticles. However, the physics of the SP enhancement effect has not been established definitely because of the lack of experimental evidence. To reveal the physical origin of this enhancement, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used to observe the SP-induced surface potential reduction in the vicinity of Ag nanoparticles on a GaN epilayer. Under ultraviolet illumination, the localized field enhancement induced by the SP forces the photogenerated electrons to drift close to the Ag nanoparticles, leading to a reduction of the surface potential around the Ag nanoparticles on the GaN epilayer. For an isolated Ag nanoparticle with a diameter of ~200&#8201;nm, the distribution of the SP localized field is located within 60&#8201;nm of the boundary of the Ag nanoparticle. For a dimer of Ag nanoparticles, the localized field enhancement between the nanoparticles was the strongest. The results presented here provide direct experimental proof of the localized field enhancement. These results not only explain the high performance of GaN detectors observed with the use of Ag nanoparticles but also reveal the physical mechanism of SP enhancement in optoelectronic devices, which will help us further understand and improve the performance of SP-based optoelectronic devices in the future.</p>",[],True,"[""Da-Bing Li"", ""Xiao-Juan Sun"", ""Yu-Ping Jia"", ""Mark I Stockman"", ""Hari P Paudel"", ""Hang Song"", ""Hong Jiang"", ""Zhi-Ming Li""]","Li, DB., Sun, XJ., Jia, YP. et al.

original article,Random lasing in an Anderson localizing optical fiber,"<p>A directional random laser mediated by transverse Anderson localization in a disordered glass optical fiber is reported. Previous demonstrations of random lasers have found limited applications because of their multi-directionality and chaotic fluctuations in the laser emission. The random laser presented in this paper operates in the Anderson localization regime. The disorder induced localized states form isolated local channels that make the output laser beam highly directional and stabilize its spectrum. The strong transverse disorder and longitudinal invariance result in isolated lasing modes with negligible interaction with their surroundings, traveling back and forth in a Fabry&#8211;Perot cavity formed by the air&#8211;fiber interfaces. It is shown that if a localized input pump is scanned across the disordered fiber input facet, the output laser signal follows the transverse position of the pump. Moreover, a uniformly distributed pump across the input facet of the disordered fiber generates a laser signal with very low spatial coherence that can be of practical importance in many optical platforms including image transport with fiber bundles.</p>",[],True,"[""Behnam Abaie"", ""Esmaeil Mobini"", ""Salman Karbasi"", ""Thomas Hawkins"", ""John Ballato"", ""Arash Mafi""]","Abaie, B., Mobini, E., Karbasi, S. et al.

original article,Superior LSPR substrates based on electromagnetic decoupling for on-a-chip high-throughput label-free biosensing,"<p>Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensing based on supported metal nanoparticles offers unparalleled possibilities for high-end miniaturization, multiplexing and high-throughput label-free molecular interaction analysis in real time when integrated within an opto-fluidic environment. However, such LSPR-sensing devices typically contain extremely large regions of dielectric materials that are open to molecular adsorption, which must be carefully blocked to avoid compromising the device readings. To address this issue, we made the support essentially invisible to the LSPR by carefully removing the dielectric material overlapping with the localized plasmonic fields through optimized wet-etching. The resulting LSPR substrate, which consists of gold nanodisks centered on narrow SiO<sub>2</sub> pillars, exhibits markedly reduced vulnerability to nonspecific substrate adsorption, thus allowing, in an ideal case, the implementation of thicker and more efficient passivation layers. We demonstrate that this approach is effective and fully compatible with state-of-the-art multiplexed real-time biosensing technology and thus represents the ideal substrate design for high-throughput label-free biosensing systems with minimal sample consumption.</p>",[],True,"[""Srdjan S A\u0107imovi\u0107"", ""Hana \u0160\u00edpov\u00e1"", ""Gustav Emilsson"", ""Andreas B Dahlin"", ""Tomasz J Antosiewicz"", ""Mikael K\u00e4ll""]","Aćimović, S., Šípová, H., Emilsson, G. et al.
