original article,Wave propagation through disordered media without backscattering and intensity variations,<p>A fundamental manifestation of wave scattering in a disordered medium is the highly complex intensity pattern the waves acquire due to multi-path interference. Here we show that these intensity variations can be entirely suppressed by adding disorder-specific gain and loss components to the medium. The resulting constant-intensity waves in such non-Hermitian scattering landscapes are free of any backscattering and feature perfect transmission through the disorder. An experimental demonstration of these unique wave states is envisioned based on spatially modulated pump beams that can flexibly control the gain and loss components in an active medium.</p>,,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Crete Center for Quantum Complexity and Nanotechnology, University of Crete, Heraklion, 71003, Greece', 'authors': ['Konstantinos G Makris']}, {'address': 'Institute for Theoretical Physics, Vienna University of Technology (TU-Wien), Vienna, 1040, Austria', 'authors': ['Andre Brandstötter', ',\xa0Philipp Ambichl', '\xa0&\xa0Stefan Rotter']}, {'address': 'Department of Mathematics, Florida State University, Tallahassee, 32306, FL, USA', 'authors': ['Ziad H Musslimani']}]",True,"['Konstantinos G Makris', 'Andre Brandstötter', 'Philipp Ambichl', 'Ziad H Musslimani', 'Stefan Rotter']","Makris, K., Brandstötter, A., Ambichl, P. et al.

original article,Achromatic super-oscillatory lenses with sub-wavelength focusing,"<p>Lenses are crucial to light-enabled technologies. Conventional lenses have been perfected to achieve near-diffraction-limited resolution and minimal chromatic aberrations. However, such lenses are bulky and cannot focus light into a hotspot smaller than a half-wavelength of light. Pupil filters, initially suggested by Toraldo di Francia, can overcome the resolution constraints of conventional lenses but are not intrinsically chromatically corrected. Here we report single-element planar lenses that not only deliver sub-wavelength focusing, thus beating the diffraction limit of conventional refractive lenses, but also focus light of different colors into the same hotspot. Using the principle of super-oscillations, we designed and fabricated a range of binary dielectric and metallic lenses for visible and infrared parts of the spectrum that are manufactured on silicon wafers, silica substrates and optical fiber tips. Such low-cost, compact lenses could be useful in mobile devices, data storage, surveillance, robotics, space applications, imaging, manufacturing with light and spatially resolved nonlinear microscopies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, The Photonic Institute, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637371, Singapore', 'authors': ['Guang Hui Yuan', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'Optoelectronics Research Centre and Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton, Highfield, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK', 'authors': ['Edward TF Rogers', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolay I Zheludev']}, {'address': 'Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Highfield, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK', 'authors': ['Edward TF Rogers']}]",True,"['Guang Hui Yuan', 'Edward TF Rogers', 'Nikolay I Zheludev']","Yuan, G., Rogers, E. & Zheludev, N.

original article,Going beyond the limit of an LCD's color gamut,"<p>In this study, we analyze how a backlight&#8217;s peak wavelength, full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), and color filters affect the color gamut of a liquid crystal display (LCD) device and establish a theoretical limit, even if the FWHM approaches 1&#8201;nm. To overcome this limit, we propose a new backlight system incorporating a functional reflective polarizer and a patterned half-wave plate to decouple the polarization states of the blue light and the green/red lights. As a result, the crosstalk between three primary colors is greatly suppressed, and the color gamut is significantly widened. In the experiment, we prepare a white-light source using a blue light-emitting diode (LED) to pump green perovskite polymer film and red quantum dots and demonstrate an exceedingly large color gamut (95.8% Rec. 2020 in Commission internationale de l'&#233;clairage (CIE) 1931 color space and 97.3% Rec. 2020 in CIE 1976 color space) with commercial high-efficiency color filters. These results are beyond the color gamut limit achievable by a conventional LCD. Our design works equally well for other light sources, such as a 2-phosphor-converted white LED.</p>",,"[{'address': 'College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32816, FL, USA', 'authors': ['Hai-Wei Chen', ',\xa0Rui-Dong Zhu', ',\xa0Juan He', ',\xa0Ya-Jie Dong', '\xa0&\xa0Shin-Tson Wu']}, {'address': 'National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures and College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China', 'authors': ['Wei Duan', ',\xa0Wei Hu', '\xa0&\xa0Yan-Qing Lu']}, {'address': 'AU Optronics Corp.', 'authors': ['Ming-Chun Li', '\xa0&\xa0Seok-Lyul Lee']}, {'address': 'NanoScience Technology Center, University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32826, FL, USA', 'authors': ['Ya-Jie Dong']}]",True,"['Hai-Wei Chen', 'Rui-Dong Zhu', 'Juan He', 'Wei Duan', 'Wei Hu', 'Yan-Qing Lu', 'Ming-Chun Li', 'Seok-Lyul Lee', 'Ya-Jie Dong', 'Shin-Tson Wu']","Chen, H., Zhu, R., He, J. et al.

original article,FRAME: femtosecond videography for atomic and molecular dynamics,"<p>Many important scientific questions in physics, chemistry and biology require effective methodologies to spectroscopically probe ultrafast intra- and inter-atomic/molecular dynamics. However, current methods that extend into the femtosecond regime are capable of only point measurements or single-snapshot visualizations and thus lack the capability to perform ultrafast spectroscopic videography of dynamic single events. Here we present a laser-probe-based method that enables two-dimensional videography at ultrafast timescales (femtosecond and shorter) of single, non-repetitive events. The method is based on superimposing a structural code onto the illumination to encrypt a single event, which is then deciphered in a post-processing step. This coding strategy enables laser probing with arbitrary wavelengths/bandwidths to collect signals with indiscriminate spectral information, thus allowing for ultrafast videography with full spectroscopic capability. To demonstrate the high temporal resolution of our method, we present videography of light propagation with record high 200 femtosecond temporal resolution. The method is widely applicable for studying a multitude of dynamical processes in physics, chemistry and biology over a wide range of time scales. Because the minimum frame separation (temporal resolution) is dictated by only the laser pulse duration, attosecond-laser technology may further increase video rates by several orders of magnitude.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Combustion Physics, Department of Physics, Lund University, Lund, SE-223 63, Sweden', 'authors': ['Andreas Ehn', ',\xa0Joakim Bood', ',\xa0Zheming Li', ',\xa0Edouard Berrocal', ',\xa0Marcus Aldén', '\xa0&\xa0Elias Kristensson']}]",True,"['Andreas Ehn', 'Joakim Bood', 'Zheming Li', 'Edouard Berrocal', 'Marcus Aldén', 'Elias Kristensson']","Ehn, A., Bood, J., Li, Z. et al.

original article,Air quality monitoring using mobile microscopy and machine learning,"<p>Rapid, accurate and high-throughput sizing and quantification of particulate matter (PM) in air is crucial for monitoring and improving air quality. In fact, particles in air with a diameter of &#8804;2.5&#8201;&#956;m have been classified as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization. Here we present a field-portable cost-effective platform for high-throughput quantification of particulate matter using computational lens-free microscopy and machine-learning. This platform, termed c-Air, is also integrated with a smartphone application for device control and display of results. This mobile device rapidly screens 6.5&#8201;L of air in 30&#8201;s and generates microscopic images of the aerosols in air. It provides statistics of the particle size and density distribution with a sizing accuracy of ~93%. We tested this mobile platform by measuring the air quality at different indoor and outdoor environments and measurement times, and compared our results to those of an Environmental Protection Agency&#8211;approved device based on beta-attenuation monitoring, which showed strong correlation to c-Air measurements. Furthermore, we used c-Air to map the air quality around Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) over 24&#8201;h to confirm that the impact of LAX on increased PM concentration was present even at &gt;7&#8201;km away from the airport, especially along the direction of landing flights. With its machine-learning-based computational microscopy interface, c-Air can be adaptively tailored to detect specific particles in air, for example, various types of pollen and mold and provide a cost-effective mobile solution for highly accurate and distributed sensing of air quality.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Yi-Chen Wu', ',\xa0Ashutosh Shiledar', ',\xa0Yi-Cheng Li', ',\xa0Steve Feng', ',\xa0Xuan Chen', ',\xa0Christine Chen', ',\xa0Kevin Jin', ',\xa0Saba Janamian', ',\xa0Zhe Yang', ',\xa0Zachary Scott Ballard', ',\xa0Zoltán Göröcs', ',\xa0Alborz Feizi', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'Bioengineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Yi-Chen Wu', ',\xa0Steve Feng', ',\xa0Zachary Scott Ballard', ',\xa0Zoltán Göröcs', ',\xa0Alborz Feizi', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Yi-Chen Wu', ',\xa0Steve Feng', ',\xa0Zachary Scott Ballard', ',\xa0Zoltán Göröcs', ',\xa0Alborz Feizi', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Jeffrey Wong']}, {'address': 'David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Aydogan Ozcan']}]",True,"['Yi-Chen Wu', 'Ashutosh Shiledar', 'Yi-Cheng Li', 'Jeffrey Wong', 'Steve Feng', 'Xuan Chen', 'Christine Chen', 'Kevin Jin', 'Saba Janamian', 'Zhe Yang', 'Zachary Scott Ballard', 'Zoltán Göröcs', 'Alborz Feizi', 'Aydogan Ozcan']","Wu, Y., Shiledar, A., Li, Y. et al.

original article,Particle manipulation beyond the diffraction limit using structured super-oscillating light beams,"<p>The diffraction-limited resolution of light focused by a lens was derived in 1873 by Ernst Abbe. Later in 1952, a method to reach sub-diffraction light spots was proposed by modulating the wavefront of the focused beam. In a related development, super-oscillating functions, that is, band-limited functions that locally oscillate faster than their highest Fourier component, were introduced and experimentally applied for super-resolution microscopy. Up till now, only simple Gaussian-like sub-diffraction spots were used. Here we show that the amplitude and phase profile of these sub-diffraction spots can be arbitrarily controlled. In particular, we utilize Hermite&#8211;Gauss, Laguerre&#8211;Gauss and Airy functions to structure super-oscillating beams with sub-diffraction lobes. These structured beams are then used for high-resolution trapping and manipulation of nanometer-sized particles. The trapping potential provides unprecedented localization accuracy and stiffness, significantly exceeding those provided by standard diffraction-limited beams.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Electrical Engineering, Fleischman Faculty of Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel', 'authors': ['Brijesh K Singh', '\xa0&\xa0Ady Arie']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Central University of Rajasthan, Ajmer, Rajasthan 305817, India', 'authors': ['Brijesh K Singh']}, {'address': 'Raymond and Beverly Sackler School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel', 'authors': ['Harel Nagar', '\xa0&\xa0Yael Roichman']}]",True,"['Brijesh K Singh', 'Harel Nagar', 'Yael Roichman', 'Ady Arie']","Singh, B., Nagar, H., Roichman, Y. et al.

original article,On-chip wireless silicon photonics: from reconfigurable interconnects to lab-on-chip devices,"<p>Photonic integrated circuits are developing as key enabling components for high-performance computing and advanced network-on-chip, as well as other emerging technologies such as lab-on-chip sensors, with relevant applications in areas from medicine and biotechnology to aerospace. These demanding applications will require novel features, such as dynamically reconfigurable light pathways, obtained by properly harnessing on-chip optical radiation. In this paper, we introduce a broadband, high directivity (&gt;150), low loss and reconfigurable silicon photonics nanoantenna that fully enables on-chip radiation control. We propose the use of these nanoantennas as versatile building blocks to develop wireless (unguided) silicon photonic devices, which considerably enhance the range of achievable integrated photonic functionalities.

original article,Endowing a plain fluidic chip with micro-optics: a holographic microscope slide,"<p>Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) devices are extremely promising in that they enable diagnostic functions at the point-of-care. Within this scope, an important goal is to design imaging schemes that can be used out of the laboratory. In this paper, we introduce and test a pocket holographic slide that allows digital holography microscopy to be performed without an interferometer setup. Instead, a commercial off-the-shelf plastic chip is engineered and functionalized with this aim. The microfluidic chip is endowed with micro-optics, that is, a diffraction grating and polymeric lenses, to build an interferometer directly on the chip, avoiding the need for a reference arm and external bulky optical components. Thanks to the single-beam scheme, the system is completely integrated and robust against vibrations, sharing the useful features of any common path interferometer. Hence, it becomes possible to bring holographic functionalities out of the lab, moving complexity from the external optical apparatus to the chip itself. Label-free imaging and quantitative phase contrast mapping of live samples are demonstrated, along with flexible refocusing capabilities.

review,"Optical manipulation from the microscale to the nanoscale: fundamentals, advances and prospects","<p>Since the invention of optical tweezers, optical manipulation has advanced significantly in scientific areas such as atomic physics, optics and biological science. Especially in the past decade, numerous optical beams and nanoscale devices have been proposed to mechanically act on nanoparticles in increasingly precise, stable and flexible ways. Both the linear and angular momenta of light can be exploited to produce optical tractor beams, tweezers and optical torque from the microscale to the nanoscale. Research on optical forces helps to reveal the nature of light&#8211;matter interactions and to resolve the fundamental aspects, which require an appropriate description of momenta and the forces on objects in matter. In this review, starting from basic theories and computational approaches, we highlight the latest optical trapping configurations and their applications in bioscience, as well as recent advances down to the nanoscale.
