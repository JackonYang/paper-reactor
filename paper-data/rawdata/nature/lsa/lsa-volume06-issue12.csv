original article,Through-needle all-optical ultrasound imaging in vivo: a preclinical swine study,"<p>High-frequency ultrasound imaging can provide exquisite visualizations of tissue to guide minimally invasive procedures. Here, we demonstrate that an all-optical ultrasound transducer, through which light guided by optical fibers is used to generate and receive ultrasound, is suitable for real-time invasive medical imaging in vivo. Broad-bandwidth ultrasound generation was achieved through the photoacoustic excitation of a multiwalled carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane composite coating on the distal end of a 300-&#956;m multi-mode optical fiber by a pulsed laser. The interrogation of a high-finesse Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity on a single-mode optical fiber by a wavelength-tunable continuous-wave laser was applied for ultrasound reception. This transducer was integrated within a custom inner transseptal needle (diameter 1.08&#8201;mm; length 78&#8201;cm) that included a metallic septum to acoustically isolate the two optical fibers. The use of this needle within the beating heart of a pig provided unprecedented real-time views (50&#8201;Hz scan rate) of cardiac tissue (depth: 2.5&#8201;cm; axial resolution: 64&#8201;&#956;m) and revealed the critical anatomical structures required to safely perform a transseptal crossing: the right and left atrial walls, the right atrial appendage, and the limbus fossae ovalis. This new paradigm will allow ultrasound imaging to be integrated into a broad range of minimally invasive devices in different clinical contexts.</p>",[],True,"[""Malcolm C Finlay"", ""Charles A Mosse"", ""Richard J Colchester"", ""Sacha Noimark"", ""Edward Z Zhang"", ""Sebastien Ourselin"", ""Paul C Beard"", ""Richard J Schilling"", ""Ivan P Parkin"", ""Ioannis Papakonstantinou"", ""Adrien E Desjardins""]","Finlay, M., Mosse, C., Colchester, R. et al.

original article,Luminescent gold nanocluster-based sensing platform for accurate H2S detection in vitro and in vivo with improved anti-interference,"<p>Gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) are promising luminescent nanomaterials due to their outstanding optical properties. However, their relatively low quantum yields and environment-dependent photoluminescence properties have limited their biological applications. To address these problems, we developed a novel strategy to prepare chitosan oligosaccharide lactate (Chi)-functionalized Au NCs (Au NCs@Chi), which exhibited emission with enhanced quantum yield and elongated emission lifetime as compared to the Au NCs, as well as exhibited environment-independent photoluminescence properties. In addition, utilizing the free amino groups of Chi onto Au NCs@Chi, we designed a FRET-based sensing platform for the detection of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). The Au NCs and the specific H<sub>2</sub>S-sensitive merocyanine compound were respectively employed as an energy donor and acceptor in the platform. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>S induced changes in the emission profile and luminescence lifetime of the platform with high sensitivity and selectivity. Utilization of the platform was demonstrated to detect exogenous and endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S in vitro and in vivo through wavelength-ratiometric and time-resolved luminescence imaging (TLI). Compared to previously reported luminescent molecules, the platform was less affected by experimental conditions and showed minimized autofluorescence interference and improved accuracy of detection.</p>",[],True,"[""Qi Yu"", ""Pengli Gao"", ""Kenneth Yin Zhang"", ""Xiao Tong"", ""Huiran Yang"", ""Shujuan Liu"", ""Jing Du"", ""Qiang Zhao"", ""Wei Huang""]","Yu, Q., Gao, P., Zhang, K. et al.

original article,Unscrambling light—automatically undoing strong mixing between modes,"<p>Propagation of light beams through scattering or multimode systems may lead to the randomization of the spatial coherence of the light. Although information is not lost, its recovery requires a coherent interferometric reconstruction of the original signals, which have been scrambled into the modes of the scattering system. Here we show that we can automatically unscramble optical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide, undoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of silicon photonics tuneable beam splitters. Transparent light detectors integrated in a photonic chip are used to directly monitor the evolution of each mode along the mesh, allowing sequential tuning and adaptive individual feedback control of each beam splitter. The entire mesh self-configures automatically through a progressive tuning algorithm and resets itself after significantly perturbing the mixing, without turning off the beams. We demonstrate information recovery by the simultaneous unscrambling, sorting and tracking of four mixed modes, with residual cross-talk of &#8722;20&#8201;dB between the beams. Circuit partitioning assisted by transparent detectors enables scalability to meshes with a higher port count and to a higher number of modes without a proportionate increase in the control complexity. The principle of self-configuring and self-resetting in optical systems should be applicable in a wide range of optical applications.</p>",[],True,"[""Andrea Annoni"", ""Emanuele Guglielmi"", ""Marco Carminati"", ""Giorgio Ferrari"", ""Marco Sampietro"", ""David AB Miller"", ""Andrea Melloni"", ""Francesco Morichetti""]","Annoni, A., Guglielmi, E., Carminati, M. et al.

original article,Plasmonic nano-printing: large-area nanoscale energy deposition for efficient surface texturing,"<p>The lossy nature of plasmonic wave due to absorption is shown to become an advantage for scaling-up a large area surface nanotexturing of transparent dielectrics and semiconductors by a self-organized sub-wavelength energy deposition leading to an ablation pattern&#8212;ripples&#8212;using this plasmonic nano-printing. Irreversible nanoscale modifications are delivered by surface plasmon polariton (SPP) using: (i) fast scan and (ii) cylindrical focusing of femtosecond laser pulses for a high patterning throughput. The mechanism of ripple formation on ZnS dielectric is experimentally proven to occur via surface wave at the substrate&#8211;plasma interface. The line focusing increase the ordering quality of ripples and facilitates fabrication over wafer-sized areas within a practical time span. Nanoprinting using SPP is expected to open new applications in photo-catalysis, tribology, and solar light harvesting via localized energy deposition rather scattering used in photonic and sensing applications based on re-scattering of SPP modes into far-field modes.</p>",[],True,"[""Lei Wang"", ""Qi-Dai Chen"", ""Xiao-Wen Cao"", ""Ri\u010dardas Buividas"", ""Xuewen Wang"", ""Saulius Juodkazis"", ""Hong-Bo Sun""]","Wang, L., Chen, QD., Cao, XW. et al.

original article,Revealing true coupling strengths in two-dimensional spectroscopy with sparsity-based signal recovery,"<p>Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy is used to study the interactions between energy levels in both the field of optics and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Conventionally, the strength of interaction between two levels is inferred from the value of their common off-diagonal peak in the 2D spectrum, which is termed the cross peak. However, stronger diagonal peaks often have long tails that extend into the locations of the cross peaks and alter their values. Here, we introduce a method for retrieving the true interaction strengths by using sparse signal recovery techniques and apply our method in 2D Raman spectroscopy experiments.</p>",[],True,"[""Hadas Frostig"", ""Tim Bayer"", ""Yonina C Eldar"", ""Yaron Silberberg""]","Frostig, H., Bayer, T., Eldar, Y. et al.

original article,Resonance-enhanced multi-octave supercontinuum generation in antiresonant hollow-core fibers,"<p>Ultrafast supercontinuum generation in gas-filled waveguides is an enabling technology for many intriguing applications ranging from attosecond metrology towards biophotonics, with the amount of spectral broadening crucially depending on the pulse dispersion of the propagating mode. In this study, we show that structural resonances in a gas-filled antiresonant hollow core optical fiber provide an additional degree of freedom in dispersion engineering, which enables the generation of more than three octaves of broadband light that ranges from deep UV wavelengths to near infrared. Our observation relies on the introduction of a geometric-induced resonance in the spectral vicinity of the ultrafast pump laser, outperforming gas dispersion and yielding a unique dispersion profile independent of core size, which is highly relevant for scaling input powers. Using a krypton-filled fiber, we observe spectral broadening from 200&#8201;nm to 1.7&#8201;&#956;m at an output energy of &#8764; 23&#8201;&#956;J within a single optical mode across the entire spectral bandwidth. Simulations show that the frequency generation results from an accelerated fission process of soliton-like waveforms in a non-adiabatic dispersion regime associated with the emission of multiple phase-matched Cherenkov radiations on both sides of the resonance. This effect, along with the dispersion tuning and scaling capabilities of the fiber geometry, enables coherent ultra-broadband and high-energy sources, which range from the UV to the mid&#8208;infrared spectral range.</p>",[],True,"[""Rudrakant Sollapur"", ""Daniil Kartashov"", ""Michael Z\u00fcrch"", ""Andreas Hoffmann"", ""Teodora Grigorova"", ""Gregor Sauer"", ""Alexander Hartung"", ""Anka Schwuchow"", ""Joerg Bierlich"", ""Jens Kobelke"", ""Mario Chemnitz"", ""Markus A Schmidt"", ""Christian Spielmann""]","Sollapur, R., Kartashov, D., Zürch, M. et al.
