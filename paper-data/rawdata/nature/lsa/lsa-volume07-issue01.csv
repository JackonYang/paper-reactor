original article,Four-dimensional light shaping: manipulating ultrafast spatiotemporal foci in space and time,"<p>The spectral dispersion of ultrashort pulses allows the simultaneous focusing of light in both space and time, which creates so-called spatiotemporal foci. Such space&#8211;time coupling may be combined with the existing holographic techniques to give a further dimension of control when generating focal light fields. In the present study, it is shown that a phase-only hologram placed in the pupil plane of an objective and illuminated by a spatially chirped ultrashort pulse can be used to generate three-dimensional arrays of spatio-temporally focused spots. By exploiting the pulse front tilt generated at focus when applying simultaneous spatial and temporal focusing (SSTF), it is possible to overlap neighboring foci in time to create a smooth intensity distribution. The resulting light field displays a high level of axial confinement, with experimental demonstrations given through two-photon microscopy and the non-linear laser fabrication of glass.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PJ, UK', 'authors': ['Bangshan Sun', ',\xa0Patrick S Salter', '\xa0&\xa0Martin J Booth']}, {'address': 'Institute of Photonic Technologies, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Konrad-Zuse-Strasse 3/5, Erlangen, 91052, Germany', 'authors': ['Bangshan Sun', ',\xa0Clemens Roider', ',\xa0Johannes Strauss', ',\xa0Johannes Heberle', '\xa0&\xa0Michael Schmidt']}, {'address': 'Division of Biomedical Physics, Innsbruck Medical University, Mullerstrasse 44, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria', 'authors': ['Clemens Roider', '\xa0&\xa0Alexander Jesacher']}, {'address': 'Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies (SAOT), Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Paul-Gordan-Strasse 6, Erlangen, 91052, Germany', 'authors': ['Alexander Jesacher', ',\xa0Johannes Strauss', ',\xa0Johannes Heberle', ',\xa0Michael Schmidt', '\xa0&\xa0Martin J Booth']}, {'address': 'Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University of Oxford, Mansfield Road, Oxford, OX1 3SR, UK', 'authors': ['Martin J Booth']}]",True,"['Bangshan Sun', 'Patrick S Salter', 'Clemens Roider', 'Alexander Jesacher', 'Johannes Strauss', 'Johannes Heberle', 'Michael Schmidt', 'Martin J Booth']","Sun, B., Salter, P., Roider, C. et al.

original article,Superluminal X-waves in a polariton quantum fluid,"<p>In this work, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time the spontaneous generation of two-dimensional exciton-polariton X-waves. X-waves belong to the family of localized packets that can sustain their shape without spreading, even in the linear regime. This allows the wavepacket to maintain its shape and size for very low densities and very long times compared to soliton waves, which always necessitate a nonlinearity to compensate the diffusion. Here, we exploit the polariton nonlinearity and uniquely structured dispersion, comprising both positive- and negative-mass curvatures, to trigger an asymmetric four-wave mixing in momentum space. This ultimately enables the self-formation of a spatial X-wave front. Using ultrafast imaging experiments, we observe the early reshaping of the initial Gaussian packet into the X-pulse and its propagation, even for vanishingly small densities. This allows us to outline the crucial effects and parameters that drive the phenomena and to tune the degree of superluminal propagation, which we found to be in close agreement with numerical simulations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'CNR NANOTEC, Istituto di Nanotecnologia, Via Monteroni, Lecce, 73100, Italy', 'authors': ['Antonio Gianfrate', ',\xa0Lorenzo Dominici', ',\xa0Dario Ballarini', ',\xa0Milena De Giorgi', ',\xa0Giuseppe Gigli', '\xa0&\xa0Daniele Sanvitto']}, {'address': 'Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, University of Gdańsk, ul.

original article,"Label-free 3D computational imaging of spermatozoon locomotion, head spin and flagellum beating over a large volume","<p>We report a high-throughput and label-free computational imaging technique that simultaneously measures in three-dimensional (3D) space the locomotion and angular spin of the freely moving heads of microswimmers and the beating patterns of their flagella over a sample volume more than two orders-of-magnitude larger compared to existing optical modalities. Using this platform, we quantified the 3D locomotion of 2133 bovine sperms and determined the spin axis and the angular velocity of the sperm head, providing the perspective of an observer seated at the moving and spinning sperm head. In this constantly transforming perspective, flagellum-beating patterns are decoupled from both the 3D translation and spin of the head, which provides the opportunity to truly investigate the 3D spatio-temporal kinematics of the flagellum. In addition to providing unprecedented information on the 3D locomotion of microswimmers, this computational imaging technique could also be instrumental for micro-robotics and sensing research, enabling the high-throughput quantification of the impact of various stimuli and chemicals on the 3D swimming patterns of sperms, motile bacteria and other micro-organisms, generating new insights into taxis behaviors and the underlying biophysics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Mustafa Ugur Daloglu', ',\xa0Wei Luo', ',\xa0Faizan Shabbir', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'Bioengineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Mustafa Ugur Daloglu', ',\xa0Wei Luo', ',\xa0Francis Lin', ',\xa0Inje Lee', ',\xa0Vishwajith Ramesh', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Mustafa Ugur Daloglu', ',\xa0Wei Luo', '\xa0&\xa0Aydogan Ozcan']}, {'address': 'Chemistry and Biochemistry Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Kevin Kim']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Jia-Qi Jiang']}, {'address': 'Department of Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Wen-Jun Cai']}, {'address': 'Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Meng-Yuan Yu']}, {'address': 'Department of Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Aydogan Ozcan']}]",True,"['Mustafa Ugur Daloglu', 'Wei Luo', 'Faizan Shabbir', 'Francis Lin', 'Kevin Kim', 'Inje Lee', 'Jia-Qi Jiang', 'Wen-Jun Cai', 'Vishwajith Ramesh', 'Meng-Yuan Yu', 'Aydogan Ozcan']","Daloglu, M., Luo, W., Shabbir, F. et al.

original article,Microwatts continuous-wave pumped second harmonic generation in few- and mono-layer GaSe,"<p>We demonstrate the first achievement of continuous-wave (CW) pumped second harmonic generation (SHG) in few- and mono-layer gallium selenide (GaSe) flakes, which are coated on silicon photonic crystal (PC) cavities. Because of ultrahigh second order nonlinearity of the two-dimensional (2D) GaSe and localized resonant mode in the PC cavity, SHG&#8217;s pump power is greatly reduced to microwatts. In a nine-layer GaSe coated PC cavity, while the optical power inside the GaSe flake is only 1.5% of that in the silicon PC slab, the SHG in GaSe is more than 650 times stronger than the third harmonic generation in silicon slab, indicating 2D GaSe&#8217;s great potentials to strengthen nonlinear processes in silicon photonics.

original article,High-resolution grayscale image hidden in a laser beam,"<p>Images perceived by human eyes or recorded by cameras are usually optical patterns with spatially varying intensity or color profiles. In addition to the intensity and color, the information of an image can be encoded in a spatially varying distribution of phase or polarization state. Interestingly, such images might not be able to be directly viewed by human eyes or cameras because they may exhibit highly uniform intensity profiles. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach to hide a high-resolution grayscale image in a square laser beam with a size of less than half a millimeter. An image with a pixel size of 300 &#215; 300&#8201;nm is encoded into the spatially variant polarization states of the laser beam, which can be revealed after passing through a linear polarizer.

original article,Octave-spanning coherent supercontinuum generation in silicon on insulator from 1.06 μm to beyond 2.4 μm,"<p>Efficient complementary metal-oxide semiconductor-based nonlinear optical devices in the near-infrared are in strong demand. Due to two-photon absorption in silicon, however, much nonlinear research is shifting towards unconventional photonics platforms. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of an octave-spanning coherent supercontinuum in a silicon waveguide covering the spectral region from the near- to shortwave-infrared. With input pulses of 18&#8201;pJ in energy, the generated signal spans the wavelength range from the edge of the silicon transmission window, approximately 1.06 to beyond 2.4&#8201;&#956;m, with a &#8722;20&#8201;dB bandwidth covering 1.124&#8211;2.4&#8201;&#956;m. An octave-spanning supercontinuum was also observed at the energy levels as low as 4&#8201;pJ (&#8722;35&#8201;dB bandwidth). We also measured the coherence over an octave, obtaining , in good agreement with the simulations. In addition, we demonstrate optimization of the third-order dispersion of the waveguide to strengthen the dispersive wave and discuss the advantage of having a soliton at the long wavelength edge of an octave-spanning signal for nonlinear applications.

original article,Thermally stimulated exciton emission in Si nanocrystals,"<p>Increasing temperature is known to quench the excitonic emission of bulk silicon, which is due to thermally induced dissociation of excitons. Here, we demonstrate that the effect of temperature on the excitonic emission is reversed for quantum-confined silicon nanocrystals. Using laser-induced heating of silicon nanocrystals embedded in SiO<sub>2</sub>, we achieved a more than threefold (&gt;300%) increase in the radiative (photon) emission rate. We theoretically modeled the observed enhancement in terms of the thermally stimulated effect, taking into account the massive phonon production under intense illumination. These results elucidate one more important advantage of silicon nanostructures, illustrating that their optical properties can be influenced by temperature. They also provide an important insight into the mechanisms of energy conversion and dissipation in ensembles of silicon nanocrystals in solid matrices. In practice, the radiative rate enhancement under strong continuous wave optical pumping is relevant for the possible application of silicon nanocrystals for spectral conversion layers in concentrator photovoltaics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Van der Waals-Zeeman Institute, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, Amsterdam, 1098 XH, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Elinore MLD de Jong', ',\xa0Huub Rutjes', ',\xa0Antonio Capretti', '\xa0&\xa0Tom Gregorkiewicz']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemical Physics and Optics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Ke Karlovu 3, Prague 2, 121 16, Czech Republic', 'authors': ['Jan Valenta']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, 2200 Bonisteel Blvd, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, USA', 'authors': ['M Tuan Trinh']}, {'address': 'Ioffe Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, 26 Polytechnicheskaya, St Petersburg, 194021, Russia', 'authors': ['Alexander N Poddubny', '\xa0&\xa0Irina N Yassievich']}]",True,"['Elinore MLD de Jong', 'Huub Rutjes', 'Jan Valenta', 'M Tuan Trinh', 'Alexander N Poddubny', 'Irina N Yassievich', 'Antonio Capretti', 'Tom Gregorkiewicz']","de Jong, E., Rutjes, H., Valenta, J. et al.

letter,Enhancement of the 'tractor-beam' pulling force on an optically bound structure,"<p>Recently, increasing attention has been devoted to mastering a new technique of optical delivery of micro-objects tractor-beam&#8217;. Such beams have uniform intensity profiles along their propagation direction and can exert a negative force that, in contrast to the familiar pushing force associated with radiation pressure, pulls the scatterer toward the light source. It was experimentally observed that under certain circumstances, the pulling force can be significantly enhanced if a non-spherical scatterer, for example, a linear chain of optically bound objects, is optically transported. Here we demonstrate that motion of two optically bound objects in a tractor beam strongly depends on theirs mutual distance and spatial orientation. Such configuration-dependent optical forces add extra flexibility to our ability to control matter with light. Understanding these interactions opens the door to new applications involving the formation, sorting or delivery of colloidal self-organized structures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Scientific Instruments of the CAS, v.v.i., Královopolská 147, Brno, 612 64, Czech Republic', 'authors': ['Jana Damková', ',\xa0Lukáš Chvátal', ',\xa0Jan Ježek', ',\xa0Jindřich Oulehla', ',\xa0Oto Brzobohatý', '\xa0&\xa0Pavel Zemánek']}]",True,"['Jana Damková', 'Lukáš Chvátal', 'Jan Ježek', 'Jindřich Oulehla', 'Oto Brzobohatý', 'Pavel Zemánek']","Damková, J., Chvátal, L., Ježek, J. et al.

letter,Direct characterization of a nonlinear photonic circuit's wave function with laser light,"<p>Integrated photonics is a leading platform for quantum technologies including nonclassical state generation, demonstration of quantum computational complexity and secure quantum communications. As photonic circuits grow in complexity, full quantum tomography becomes impractical, and therefore an efficient method for their characterization is essential. Here we propose and demonstrate a fast, reliable method for reconstructing the two-photon state produced by an arbitrary quadratically nonlinear optical circuit. By establishing a rigorous correspondence between the generated quantum state and classical sum-frequency generation measurements from laser light, we overcome the limitations of previous approaches for lossy multi-mode devices. We applied this protocol to a multi-channel nonlinear waveguide network and measured a 99.28&#177;0.31% fidelity between classical and quantum characterization.
