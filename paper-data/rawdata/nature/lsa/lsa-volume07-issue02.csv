review article,"Electrons dynamics control by shaping femtosecond laser pulses in micro/nanofabrication: modeling, method, measurement and application","<p>During femtosecond laser fabrication, photons are mainly absorbed by electrons, and the subsequent energy transfer from electrons to ions is of picosecond order. Hence, lattice motion is negligible within the femtosecond pulse duration, whereas femtosecond photon-electron interactions dominate the entire fabrication process. Therefore, femtosecond laser fabrication must be improved by controlling localized transient electron dynamics, which poses a challenge for measuring and controlling at the electron level during fabrication processes. Pump-probe spectroscopy presents a viable solution, which can be used to observe electron dynamics during a chemical reaction. In fact, femtosecond pulse durations are shorter than many physical/chemical characteristic times, which permits manipulating, adjusting, or interfering with electron dynamics. Hence, we proposed to control localized transient electron dynamics by temporally or spatially shaping femtosecond pulses, and further to modify localized transient materials properties, and then to adjust material phase change, and eventually to implement a novel fabrication method. This review covers our progresses over the past decade regarding electrons dynamics control (EDC) by shaping femtosecond laser pulses in micro/nanomanufacturing: (1) Theoretical models were developed to prove EDC feasibility and reveal its mechanisms; (2) on the basis of the theoretical predictions, many experiments are conducted to validate our EDC-based femtosecond laser fabrication method. Seven examples are reported, which proves that the proposed method can significantly improve fabrication precision, quality, throughput and repeatability and effectively control micro/nanoscale structures; (3) a multiscale measurement system was proposed and developed to study the fundamentals of EDC from the femtosecond scale to the nanosecond scale and to the millisecond scale; and (4) As an example of practical applications, our method was employed to fabricate some key structures in one of the 16 Chinese National S&amp;T Major Projects, for which electron dynamics were measured using our multiscale measurement system.</p>",[],True,"[""Lan Jiang"", ""An-Dong Wang"", ""Bo Li"", ""Tian-Hong Cui"", ""Yong-Feng Lu""]","Jiang, L., Wang, AD., Li, B. et al.

original article,Monolithically integrated stretchable photonics,"<p>Mechanically stretchable photonics provides a new geometric degree of freedom for photonic system design and foresees applications ranging from artificial skins to soft wearable electronics. Here we describe the design and experimental realization of the first single-mode stretchable photonic devices. These devices, made of chalcogenide glass and epoxy polymer materials, are monolithically integrated on elastomer substrates. To impart mechanical stretching capability to devices built using these intrinsically brittle materials, our design strategy involves local substrate stiffening to minimize shape deformation of critical photonic components, and interconnecting optical waveguides assuming a meandering Euler spiral geometry to mitigate radiative optical loss. Devices fabricated following such design can sustain 41% nominal tensile strain and 3000 stretching cycles without measurable degradation in optical performance. In addition, we present a rigorous analytical model to quantitatively predict stress-optical coupling behavior in waveguide devices of arbitrary geometry without using a single fitting parameter.</p>",[],True,"[""Lan Li"", ""Hongtao Lin"", ""Shutao Qiao"", ""Yi-Zhong Huang"", ""Jun-Ying Li"", ""J\u00e9r\u00f4me Michon"", ""Tian Gu"", ""Carlos Alosno-Ramos"", ""Laurent Vivien"", ""Anupama Yadav"", ""Kathleen Richardson"", ""Nanshu Lu"", ""Juejun Hu""]","Li, L., Lin, H., Qiao, S. et al.

original article,Non-contact mechanical and chemical analysis of single living cells by microspectroscopic techniques,"<p>Innovative label-free microspectroscopy, which can simultaneously collect Brillouin and Raman signals, is used to characterize the viscoelastic properties and chemical composition of living cells with sub-micrometric resolution. The unprecedented statistical accuracy of the data combined with the high-frequency resolution and the high contrast of the recently built experimental setup permits the study of single living cells immersed in their buffer solution by contactless measurements. The Brillouin signal is deconvoluted in the buffer and the cell components, thereby revealing the mechanical heterogeneity inside the cell. In particular, a 20% increase is observed in the elastic modulus passing from the plasmatic membrane to the nucleus as distinguished by comparison with the Raman spectroscopic marker. Brillouin line shape analysis is even more relevant for the comparison of cells under physiological and pathological conditions. Following oncogene expression, cells show an overall reduction in the elastic modulus (15%) and apparent viscosity (50%). In a proof-of-principle experiment, the ability of this spectroscopic technique to characterize subcellular compartments and distinguish cell status was successfully tested. The results strongly support the future application of this technique for fundamental issues in the biomedical field.</p>",[],True,"[""Sara Mattana"", ""Maurizio Mattarelli"", ""Lorena Urbanelli"", ""Krizia Sagini"", ""Carla Emiliani"", ""Mauro Dalla Serra"", ""Daniele Fioretto"", ""Silvia Caponi""]","Mattana, S., Mattarelli, M., Urbanelli, L. et al.

original article,Phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction using deep learning in neural networks,"<p>Phase recovery from intensity-only measurements forms the heart of coherent imaging techniques and holography. In this study, we demonstrate that a neural network can learn to perform phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction after appropriate training. This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference-related spatial artifacts. This neural network-based method is fast to compute and reconstructs phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, requiring fewer measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing the phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears and tissue sections. These results highlight that challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome through machine learning, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.</p>",[],True,"[""Yair Rivenson"", ""Yibo Zhang"", ""Harun G\u00fcnayd\u0131n"", ""Da Teng"", ""Aydogan Ozcan""]","Rivenson, Y., Zhang, Y., Günaydın, H. et al.

original article,"Near-UV electroluminescence in unipolar-doped, bipolar-tunneling GaN/AlN heterostructures","<p>Cross-gap light emission is reported in n-type unipolar GaN/AlN double-barrier heterostructure diodes at room temperature. Three different designs were grown on semi-insulating bulk GaN substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). All samples displayed a single electroluminescent spectral peak at 360&#8201;nm with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values no greater than 16&#8201;nm and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;0.0074% at 18.8&#8201;mA. In contrast to traditional GaN light emitters, p-type doping and p-contacts are completely avoided, and instead, holes are created in the GaN on the emitter side of the tunneling structure by direct interband (that is, Zener) tunneling from the valence band to the conduction band on the collector side. The Zener tunneling is enhanced by the high electric fields (~5 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>&#8201;V&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) created by the notably large polarization-induced sheet charge at the interfaces between the AlN and GaN.</p>",[],True,"[""Tyler A Growden"", ""Weidong Zhang"", ""Elliott R Brown"", ""David F Storm"", ""David J Meyer"", ""Paul R Berger""]","Growden, T., Zhang, W., Brown, E. et al.

original article,Phase-sensitive plasmonic biosensor using a portable and large field-of-view interferometric microarray imager,"<p>Nanophotonics, and more specifically plasmonics, provides a rich toolbox for biomolecular sensing, since the engineered metasurfaces can enhance light&#8211;matter interactions to unprecedented levels. So far, biosensing associated with high-quality factor plasmonic resonances has almost exclusively relied on detection of spectral shifts and their associated intensity changes. However, the phase response of the plasmonic resonances have rarely been exploited, mainly because this requires a more sophisticated optical arrangement. Here we present a new phase-sensitive platform for high-throughput and label-free biosensing enhanced by plasmonics. It employs specifically designed Au nanohole arrays and a large field-of-view interferometric lens-free imaging reader operating in a collinear optical path configuration. This unique combination allows the detection of atomically thin (angstrom-level) topographical features over large areas, enabling simultaneous reading of thousands of microarray elements. As the plasmonic chips are fabricated using scalable techniques and the imaging reader is built with low-cost off-the-shelf consumer electronic and optical components, the proposed platform is ideal for point-of-care ultrasensitive biomarker detection from small sample volumes.

original article,Giant intrinsic chiro-optical activity in planar dielectric nanostructures,"<p>The strong optical chirality arising from certain synthetic metamaterials has important and widespread applications in polarization optics, stereochemistry and spintronics. However, these intrinsically chiral metamaterials are restricted to a complicated three-dimensional (3D) geometry, which leads to significant fabrication challenges, particularly at visible wavelengths. Their planar two-dimensional (2D) counterparts are limited by symmetry considerations to operation at oblique angles (extrinsic chirality) and possess significantly weaker chiro-optical responses close to normal incidence. Here, we address the challenge of realizing strong intrinsic chirality from thin, planar dielectric nanostructures. Most notably, we experimentally achieve near-unity circular dichroism with ~90% of the light with the chosen helicity being transmitted at a wavelength of 540&#8201;nm. This is the highest value demonstrated to date for any geometry in the visible spectrum. We interpret this result within the charge-current multipole expansion framework and show that the excitation of higher-order multipoles is responsible for the giant circular dichroism. These experimental results enable the realization of high-performance miniaturized chiro-optical components in a scalable manner at optical frequencies.</p>",[],True,"[""Alexander Y Zhu"", ""Wei Ting Chen"", ""Aun Zaidi"", ""Yao-Wei Huang"", ""Mohammadreza Khorasaninejad"", ""Vyshakh Sanjeev"", ""Cheng-Wei Qiu"", ""Federico Capasso""]","Zhu, A., Chen, W., Zaidi, A. et al.

letter,"Multi-mW, few-cycle mid-infrared continuum spanning from 500 to 2250 cm−1","<p>The demand for and usage of broadband coherent mid-infrared sources, such as those provided by synchrotron facilities, are growing. Since most organic molecules exhibit characteristic vibrational modes in the wavelength range between 500 and 4000&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, such broadband coherent sources enable micro- or even nano-spectroscopic applications at or below the diffraction limit with a high signal-to-noise ratio.
