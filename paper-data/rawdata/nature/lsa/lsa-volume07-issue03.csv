review article,Twisted photons: new quantum perspectives in high dimensions,"<p>Twisted photons can be used as alphabets to encode information beyond one bit per single photon. This ability offers great potential for quantum information tasks, as well as for the investigation of fundamental questions. In this review article, we give a brief overview of the theoretical differences between qubits and higher dimensional systems, qudits, in different quantum information scenarios. We then describe recent experimental developments in this field over the past three years. Finally, we summarize some important experimental and theoretical questions that might be beneficial to understand better in the near future.</p>",[],True,"[""Manuel Erhard"", ""Robert Fickler"", ""Mario Krenn"", ""Anton Zeilinger""]","Erhard, M., Fickler, R., Krenn, M. et al.

review article,Liquid crystal display and organic light-emitting diode display: present status and future perspectives,"<p>Recently, &#8216;Liquid crystal display (LCD) vs. organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display: who wins?&#8217; has become a topic of heated debate. In this review, we perform a systematic and comparative study of these two flat panel display technologies. First, we review recent advances in LCDs and OLEDs, including material development, device configuration and system integration. Next we analyze and compare their performances by six key display metrics: response time, contrast ratio, color gamut, lifetime, power efficiency, and panel flexibility. In this section, we focus on two key parameters: motion picture response time (MPRT) and ambient contrast ratio (ACR), which dramatically affect image quality in practical application scenarios. MPRT determines the image blur of a moving picture, and ACR governs the perceived image contrast under ambient lighting conditions. It is intriguing that LCD can achieve comparable or even slightly better MPRT and ACR than OLED, although its response time and contrast ratio are generally perceived to be much inferior to those of OLED. Finally, three future trends are highlighted, including high dynamic range, virtual reality/augmented reality and smart displays with versatile functions.</p>",[],True,"[""Hai-Wei Chen"", ""Jiun-Haw Lee"", ""Bo-Yen Lin"", ""Stanley Chen"", ""Shin-Tson Wu""]","Chen, HW., Lee, JH., Lin, BY. et al.

original article,Direct fiber vector eigenmode multiplexing transmission seeded by integrated optical vortex emitters,"<p>Spatial modes have received substantial attention over the last decades and are used in optical communication applications. In fiber-optic communications, the employed linearly polarized modes and phase vortex modes carrying orbital angular momentum can be synthesized by fiber vector eigenmodes. To improve the transmission capacity and miniaturize the communication system, straightforward fiber vector eigenmode multiplexing and generation of fiber-eigenmode-like polarization vortices (vector vortex modes) using photonic integrated devices are of substantial interest. Here, we propose and demonstrate direct fiber vector eigenmode multiplexing transmission seeded by integrated optical vortex emitters. By exploiting vector vortex modes (radially and azimuthally polarized beams) generated from silicon microring resonators etched with angular gratings, we report data-carrying fiber vector eigenmode multiplexing transmission through a 2-km large-core fiber, showing low-level mode crosstalk and favorable link performance. These demonstrations may open up added capacity scaling opportunities by directly accessing multiple vector eigenmodes in the fiber and provide compact solutions to replace bulky diffractive optical elements for generating various optical vector beams.</p>",[],True,"[""Jun Liu"", ""Shi-Mao Li"", ""Long Zhu"", ""An-Dong Wang"", ""Shi Chen"", ""Charalambos Klitis"", ""Cheng Du"", ""Qi Mo"", ""Marc Sorel"", ""Si-Yuan Yu"", ""Xin-Lun Cai"", ""Jian Wang""]","Liu, J., Li, SM., Zhu, L. et al.

original article,Spiniform phase-encoded metagratings entangling arbitrary rational-order orbital angular momentum,"<p>Quantum entanglements between integer-order and fractional-order orbital angular momentums (OAMs) have been previously discussed. However, the entangled nature of arbitrary rational-order OAM has long been considered a myth due to the absence of an effective strategy for generating arbitrary rational-order OAM beams. Therefore, we report a single metadevice comprising a bilaterally symmetric grating with an aperture, creating optical beams with dynamically controllable OAM values that are continuously varying over a rational range. Due to its encoded spiniform phase, this novel metagrating enables the production of an average OAM that can be increased without a theoretical limit by embracing distributed singularities, which differs significantly from the classic method of stacking phase singularities using fork gratings. This new method makes it possible to probe the unexplored niche of quantum entanglement between arbitrarily defined OAMs in light, which could lead to the complex manipulation of microparticles, high-dimensional quantum entanglement and optical communication. We show that quantum coincidence based on rational-order OAM-superposition states could give rise to low cross-talks between two different states that have no significant overlap in their spiral spectra. Additionally, future applications in quantum communication and optical micromanipulation may be found.</p>",[],True,"[""Kun Huang"", ""Hong Liu"", ""Sara Restuccia"", ""Muhammad Q Mehmood"", ""Sheng-Tao Mei"", ""Daniel Giovannini"", ""Aaron Danner"", ""Miles J Padgett"", ""Jing-Hua Teng"", ""Cheng-Wei Qiu""]","Huang, K., Liu, H., Restuccia, S. et al.

original article,All-optical dynamic focusing of light via coherent absorption in a plasmonic metasurface,"<p>Vision, microscopy, imaging, optical data projection and storage all depend on focusing of light. Dynamic focusing is conventionally achieved with mechanically reconfigurable lenses, spatial light modulators or microfluidics. Here we demonstrate that dynamic control of focusing can be achieved through coherent interaction of optical waves on a thin beam splitter. We use a nanostructured plasmonic metasurface of subwavelength thickness as the beam splitter, allowing operation in the regimes of coherent absorption and coherent transparency. Focusing of light resulting from illumination of the plasmonic metasurface with a Fresnel zone pattern is controlled by another patterned beam projected on the same metasurface. By altering the control pattern, its phase, or its intensity, we switch the lens function on and off, and alter the focal spot&#8217;s depth, diameter and intensity. Switching occurs as fast as the control beam is modulated and therefore tens of gigahertz modulation bandwidth is possible with electro-optical modulators, which is orders of magnitude faster than conventional dynamic focusing technologies.</p>",[],True,"[""Maria Papaioannou"", ""Eric Plum"", ""Edward TF Rogers"", ""Nikolay I Zheludev""]","Papaioannou, M., Plum, E., Rogers, E. et al.

original article,Ultra-fast polymer optical fibre Bragg grating inscription for medical devices,"<p>We report the extraordinary result of rapid fibre Bragg grating inscription in doped polymer optical fibres based on polymethyl methacrylate in only 7&#8201;ms, which is two orders of magnitude faster than the inscription times previously reported. This was achieved using a new dopant material, diphenyl disulphide, which was found to enable a fast, positive refractive index change using a low ultraviolet dose. These changes were investigated and found to arise from photodissociation of the diphenyl disulphide molecule and subsequent molecular reorganization. We demonstrate that gratings inscribed in these fibres can exhibit at least a 15 times higher sensitivity than silica glass fibre, despite their quick inscription times. As a demonstration of the sensitivity, we selected a highly stringent situation, namely, the monitoring of a human heartbeat and respiratory functions. These findings could permit the inscription of fibre Bragg gratings during the fibre drawing process for mass production, allowing cost-effective, single-use, in vivo sensors among other potential uses.</p>",[],True,"[""Julien Bonefacino"", ""Hwa-Yaw Tam"", ""Tom S Glen"", ""Xin Cheng"", ""Chi-Fung Jeff Pun"", ""Jian Wang"", ""Po-Heng Lee"", ""Ming-Leung Vincent Tse"", ""Steven T Boles""]","Bonefacino, J., Tam, HY., Glen, T. et al.

original article,X-ray focusing with efficient high-NA multilayer Laue lenses,"<p>Multilayer Laue lenses are volume diffraction elements for the efficient focusing of X-rays. With a new manufacturing technique that we introduced, it is possible to fabricate lenses of sufficiently high numerical aperture (NA) to achieve focal spot sizes below 10&#8201;nm. The alternating layers of the materials that form the lens must span a broad range of thicknesses on the nanometer scale to achieve the necessary range of X-ray deflection angles required to achieve a high NA. This poses a challenge to both the accuracy of the deposition process and the control of the materials properties, which often vary with layer thickness. We introduced a new pair of materials&#8212;tungsten carbide and silicon carbide&#8212;to prepare layered structures with smooth and sharp interfaces and with no material phase transitions that hampered the manufacture of previous lenses. Using a pair of multilayer Laue lenses (MLLs) fabricated from this system, we achieved a two-dimensional focus of 8.4 &#215; 6.8&#8201;nm<sup>2</sup> at a photon energy of 16.3&#8201;keV with high diffraction efficiency and demonstrated scanning-based imaging of samples with a resolution well below 10&#8201;nm. The high NA also allowed projection holographic imaging with strong phase contrast over a large range of magnifications.

original article,Quantum enhancement of accuracy and precision in optical interferometry,"<p>White-light interferometry is one of today&#8217;s most precise tools for determining the properties of optical materials. Its achievable precision and accuracy are typically limited by systematic errors due to a high number of interdependent data-fitting parameters. Here, we introduce spectrally resolved quantum white-light interferometry as a novel tool for optical property measurements, notably, chromatic dispersion in optical fibres. By exploiting both spectral and photon-number correlations of energy-time entangled photon pairs, the number of fitting parameters is significantly reduced, which eliminates systematic errors and leads to an absolute determination of the material parameter. By comparing the quantum method to state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate the quantum advantage of 2.4 times better measurement precision, despite requiring 62 times fewer photons. The improved results are due to conceptual advantages enabled by quantum optics, which are likely to define new standards in experimental methods for characterising optical materials.</p>",[],True,"[""Florian Kaiser"", ""Panagiotis Vergyris"", ""Djeylan Aktas"", ""Charles Babin"", ""Laurent Labont\u00e9"", ""S\u00e9bastien Tanzilli""]","Kaiser, F., Vergyris, P., Aktas, D. et al.

original article,Near-infrared and mid-infrared semiconductor broadband light emitters,"<p>Semiconductor broadband light emitters have emerged as ideal and vital light sources for a range of biomedical sensing/imaging applications, especially for optical coherence tomography systems. Although near-infrared broadband light emitters have found increasingly wide utilization in these imaging applications, the requirement to simultaneously achieve both a high spectral bandwidth and output power is still challenging for such devices. Owing to the relatively weak amplified spontaneous emission, as a consequence of the very short non-radiative carrier lifetime of the inter-subband transitions in quantum cascade structures, it is even more challenging to obtain desirable mid-infrared broadband light emitters. There have been great efforts in the past 20 years to pursue high-efficiency broadband optical gain and very low reflectivity in waveguide structures, which are two key factors determining the performance of broadband light emitters. Here we describe the realization of a high continuous wave light power of &gt;20&#8201;mW and broadband width of &gt;130&#8201;nm with near-infrared broadband light emitters and the first mid-infrared broadband light emitters operating under continuous wave mode at room temperature by employing a modulation p-doped InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot active region with a &#8216;J&#8217;-shape ridge waveguide structure and a quantum cascade active region with a dual-end analogous monolithic integrated tapered waveguide structure, respectively. This work is of great importance to improve the performance of existing near-infrared optical coherence tomography systems and describes a major advance toward reliable and cost-effective mid-infrared imaging and sensing systems, which do not presently exist due to the lack of appropriate low-coherence mid-infrared semiconductor broadband light sources.</p>",[],True,"[""Chun-Cai Hou"", ""Hong-Mei Chen"", ""Jin-Chuan Zhang"", ""Ning Zhuo"", ""Yuan-Qing Huang"", ""Richard A Hogg"", ""David TD Childs"", ""Ji-Qiang Ning"", ""Zhan-Guo Wang"", ""Feng-Qi Liu"", ""Zi-Yang Zhang""]","Hou, CC., Chen, HM., Zhang, JC. et al.
