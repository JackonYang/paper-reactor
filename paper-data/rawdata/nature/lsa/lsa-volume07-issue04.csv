letter,Ultra-broadband on-chip twisted light emitter for optical communications,"<p>On-chip twisted light emitters are essential components of orbital angular momentum (OAM) communication devices. These devices address the growing demand for high-capacity communication systems by providing an additional degree of freedom for wavelength/frequency division multiplexing (WDM/FDM). Although whispering-gallery-mode-enabled OAM emitters have been shown to possess some advantages, such as compactness and phase accuracy, their inherent narrow bandwidths prevent them from being compatible with WDM/FDM techniques. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-broadband multiplexed OAM emitter that utilizes a novel joint path-resonance phase control concept. The emitter has a micron-sized radius and nanometer-sized features. Coaxial OAM beams are emitted across the entire telecommunication band from 1,450 to 1,650&#8201;nm. We applied the emitter to an OAM communication with a data rate of 1.2&#8201;Tbit/s assisted by 30-channel optical frequency combs (OFCs). The emitter provides a new solution to further increase capacity in the OFC communication scenario.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nanophotonics Research Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Micro-scale Optical Information Technology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China', 'authors': ['Zhenwei Xie', ',\xa0Ting Lei', ',\xa0Changjun Min', ',\xa0Luping Du', '\xa0&\xa0Xiaocong Yuan']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies and School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China', 'authors': ['Fan Li', '\xa0&\xa0Zhaohui Li']}, {'address': 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore', 'authors': ['Haodong Qiu', ',\xa0Zecen Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Hong Wang']}]",True,"['Zhenwei Xie', 'Ting Lei', 'Fan Li', 'Haodong Qiu', 'Zecen Zhang', 'Hong Wang', 'Changjun Min', 'Luping Du', 'Zhaohui Li', 'Xiaocong Yuan']","Xie, Z., Lei, T., Li, F. et al.

original article,Optically sizing single atmospheric particulates with a 10-nm resolution using a strong evanescent field,"<p>Although an accurate evaluation of the distribution of ultrafine particulate matter in air is of utmost significance to public health, the usually used PM<sub>2.5</sub> index fails to provide size distribution information. Here we demonstrate a low-profile and cavity-free size spectrometer for probing fine and ultrafine particulate matter by using the enhanced particle-perturbed scattering in strong optical evanescent fields of a nanofiber array. The unprecedented size resolution reaches 10&#8201;nm for detecting single 100-nm-diameter nanoparticles by employing uniform nanofibers and controlling the polarizations of the probe light. This size spectrometry was tested and used to retrieve the size distribution of particulate matter in the air of Beijing, yielding mass concentrations of nanoparticles, as a secondary exercise, consistent with the officially released data. This nanofiber-array probe shows potential for the full monitoring of air pollution and for studying early-stage haze evolution and can be further extended to explore nanoparticle interactions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory for Mesoscopic Physics and School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China', 'authors': ['Xiao-Chong Yu', ',\xa0Yanyan Zhi', ',\xa0Shui-Jing Tang', ',\xa0Bei-Bei Li', ',\xa0Qihuang Gong', '\xa0&\xa0Yun-Feng Xiao']}, {'address': 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Beijing, 100871, China', 'authors': ['Yanyan Zhi', ',\xa0Qihuang Gong', '\xa0&\xa0Yun-Feng Xiao']}, {'address': 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, 030006, China', 'authors': ['Shui-Jing Tang', ',\xa0Qihuang Gong', '\xa0&\xa0Yun-Feng Xiao']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117583, Singapore', 'authors': ['Cheng-Wei Qiu']}, {'address': 'NUS Suzhou Research Institute (NUSRI), Suzhou, 215123, China', 'authors': ['Cheng-Wei Qiu']}, {'address': 'SZU-NUS Collaborative Innovation Center for Optoelectronic Science & Technology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China', 'authors': ['Cheng-Wei Qiu']}]",True,"['Xiao-Chong Yu', 'Yanyan Zhi', 'Shui-Jing Tang', 'Bei-Bei Li', 'Qihuang Gong', 'Cheng-Wei Qiu', 'Yun-Feng Xiao']","Yu, X., Zhi, Y., Tang, S. et al.

Herein, we introduce a new concept of localization optoacoustic tomography (LOT) that employs rapid sequential acquisition of three-dimensional optoacoustic images from flowing absorbing particles. We show that the new method enables breaking through the spatial resolution barrier of acoustic diffraction while further enhancing the visibility of structures under limited-view tomographic conditions.

original article,Boron nitride nanoresonators for phonon-enhanced molecular vibrational spectroscopy at the strong coupling limit,"<p>Enhanced light-matter interactions are the basis of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy, and conventionally rely on plasmonic materials and their capability to focus light to nanoscale spot sizes. Phonon polariton nanoresonators made of polar crystals could represent an interesting alternative, since they exhibit large quality factors, which go far beyond those of their plasmonic counterparts. The recent emergence of van der Waals crystals enables the fabrication of high-quality nanophotonic resonators based on phonon polaritons, as reported for the prototypical infrared-phononic material hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). In this work we use, for the first time, phonon-polariton-resonant h-BN ribbons for SEIRA spectroscopy of small amounts of organic molecules in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Strikingly, the interaction between phonon polaritons and molecular vibrations reaches experimentally the onset of the strong coupling regime, while numerical simulations predict that vibrational strong coupling can be fully achieved. Phonon polariton nanoresonators thus could become a viable platform for sensing, local control of chemical reactivity and infrared quantum cavity optics experiments.</p>",,"[{'address': 'CIC nanoGUNE, Donostia-San Sebastián, 20018, Spain', 'authors': ['Marta Autore', ',\xa0Peining Li', ',\xa0Irene Dolado', ',\xa0Francisco J Alfaro-Mozaz', ',\xa0Ainhoa Atxabal', ',\xa0Fèlix Casanova', ',\xa0Luis E Hueso', '\xa0&\xa0Saül Vélez']}, {'address': 'Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC), Donostia-San Sebastián, 20018, Spain', 'authors': ['Ruben Esteban', ',\xa0Javier Aizpurua', '\xa0&\xa0Alexey Y Nikitin']}, {'address': 'IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, 48013, Spain', 'authors': ['Ruben Esteban', ',\xa0Fèlix Casanova', ',\xa0Luis E Hueso', ',\xa0Alexey Y Nikitin', '\xa0&\xa0Rainer Hillenbrand']}, {'address': 'Departamento de Física, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, 33007, Spain', 'authors': ['Pablo Alonso-González']}, {'address': 'Centro de Física de Materiales (MPC, CSIC-UPV/EHU), Donostia-San Sebastián, 20018, Spain', 'authors': ['Javier Aizpurua']}, {'address': 'CIC nanoGUNE and UPV/EHU, Donostia-San Sebastián, 20018, Spain', 'authors': ['Rainer Hillenbrand']}]",True,"['Marta Autore', 'Peining Li', 'Irene Dolado', 'Francisco J Alfaro-Mozaz', 'Ruben Esteban', 'Ainhoa Atxabal', 'Fèlix Casanova', 'Luis E Hueso', 'Pablo Alonso-González', 'Javier Aizpurua', 'Alexey Y Nikitin', 'Saül Vélez', 'Rainer Hillenbrand']","Autore, M., Li, P., Dolado, I. et al.

original article,Multispectral light scattering endoscopic imaging of esophageal precancer,"<p>Esophageal adenocarcinoma is the most rapidly growing cancer in America. Although the prognosis after diagnosis is unfavorable, the chance of a successful outcome increases tremendously if detected early while the lesion is still dysplastic. Unfortunately, the present standard-of-care, endoscopic surveillance, has major limitations, since dysplasia is invisible, often focal, and systematic biopsies typically sample less than one percent of the esophageal lining and therefore easily miss malignancies. To solve this problem we developed a multispectral light scattering endoscopic imaging system. It surveys the entire esophageal lining and accurately detects subcellular dysplastic changes. The system combines light scattering spectroscopy, which detects and identifies invisible dysplastic sites by analyzing light scattered from epithelial cells, with rapid scanning of the entire esophageal lining using a collimated broadband light beam delivered by an endoscopically compatible fiber optic probe. Here we report the results of the first comprehensive multispectral imaging study, conducted as part of routine endoscopic procedures performed on patients with suspected dysplasia. In a double-blind study that characterized the system&#8217;s ability to serve as a screening tool, 55 out of 57 patients were diagnosed correctly. In addition, a smaller double-blind comparison of the multispectral data in 24 patients with subsequent pathology at locations where 411 biopsies were collected yielded an accuracy of 90% in detecting individual locations of dysplasia, demonstrating the capability of this method to serve as a guide for biopsy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Center for Advanced Biomedical Imaging and Photonics, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, Boston, 02215, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Le Qiu', ',\xa0Vladimir Turzhitsky', ',\xa0Umar Khan', ',\xa0Yuri N Zakharov', ',\xa0Lei Zhang', ',\xa0Edward Vitkin', ',\xa0Irving Itzkan', '\xa0&\xa0Lev T Perelman']}, {'address': 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, Boston, 02215, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Ram Chuttani', ',\xa0Douglas K Pleskow', ',\xa0Tyler M Berzin', ',\xa0Mandeep S Sawhney', '\xa0&\xa0Lev T Perelman']}, {'address': 'Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, Boston, 02215, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Eric U Yee', '\xa0&\xa0Jeffrey D Goldsmith']}, {'address': 'Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, Boston, 02215, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Yunping Li']}, {'address': 'Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program, Harvard University, Boston, 02215, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Lev T Perelman']}]",True,"['Le Qiu', 'Ram Chuttani', 'Douglas K Pleskow', 'Vladimir Turzhitsky', 'Umar Khan', 'Yuri N Zakharov', 'Lei Zhang', 'Tyler M Berzin', 'Eric U Yee', 'Mandeep S Sawhney', 'Yunping Li', 'Edward Vitkin', 'Jeffrey D Goldsmith', 'Irving Itzkan', 'Lev T Perelman']","Qiu, L., Chuttani, R., Pleskow, D. et al.

original article,New design for highly durable infrared-reflective coatings,"<p>The fundamental challenge in designing durable infrared-reflective coatings is achieving the ideal combination of both high reflectivity and durability. Satisfying these competing demands is traditionally achieved by deposition of durable layers on highly reflective metals. We overturn the traditional logic of &#8216;first reflectivity and then durability&#8217; and propose an alternative of &#8216;first durability and then reflectivity&#8217;: First, a transition-metal compound is selected as a durable base; then its reflectivity is improved by incorporating silver/gold to form an alloy or by overcoating a multilayer stack. Two validation experiments prove that the new strategy works extremely well: the coatings thus obtained have infrared reflectivities close to that of aluminum, and their hardness and acid and salt corrosion resistances are 27&#8211;50, 400&#8211;1 500 and 7 500&#8211;25 000 times that of aluminum. The traditional mirror coating (e.g., Al/SiO<sub>2</sub> films) is more suitable for moderate environments, while our mirror coating that was obtained by the new strategy (e.g., an Ag-doped hafnium nitride film) is more suitable for harsh environments, such as ones with dust, windblown sand, moisture, acid rain or salt fog. This work opens up new opportunities for highly durable infrared-reflective coatings and rejuvenates the study of transition metal compounds in a completely new area of optics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials, Key Laboratory of Automobile Materials of MOE, and School of Materials Science and Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China', 'authors': ['Chaoquan Hu', ',\xa0Jian Liu', ',\xa0Zhiqing Gu', ',\xa0Chao Li', ',\xa0Qian Li', ',\xa0Yuankai Li', ',\xa0Chaobin Bi', ',\xa0Xiaofeng Fan', '\xa0&\xa0Weitao Zheng']}, {'address': 'School of Science, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, 130022, China', 'authors': ['Jianbo Wang']}, {'address': 'Faculty of Materials and Energy, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China', 'authors': ['Sam Zhang']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control, Jilin University, Changchun, 130025, China', 'authors': ['Weitao Zheng']}]",True,"['Chaoquan Hu', 'Jian Liu', 'Jianbo Wang', 'Zhiqing Gu', 'Chao Li', 'Qian Li', 'Yuankai Li', 'Sam Zhang', 'Chaobin Bi', 'Xiaofeng Fan', 'Weitao Zheng']","Hu, C., Liu, J., Wang, J. et al.

original article,Ultraviolet laser photolysis of hydrocarbons for nondiamond carbon suppression in chemical vapor deposition of diamond films,"<p>In this work, we demonstrate that ultraviolet (UV) laser photolysis of hydrocarbon species alters the flame chemistry such that it promotes the diamond growth rate and film quality. Optical emission spectroscopy and laser-induced fluorescence demonstrate that direct UV laser irradiation of a diamond-forming combustion flame produces a large amount of reactive species that play critical roles in diamond growth, thereby leading to enhanced diamond growth. The diamond growth rate is more than doubled, and diamond quality is improved by 4.2%. Investigation of the diamond nucleation process suggests that the diamond nucleation time is significantly shortened and nondiamond carbon accumulation is greatly suppressed with UV laser irradiation of the combustion flame in a laser-parallel-to-substrate geometry. A narrow amorphous carbon transition zone, averaging 4&#8201;nm in thickness, is identified at the film&#8211;substrate interface area using transmission electron microscopy, confirming the suppression effect of UV laser irradiation on nondiamond carbon formation.

original article,Bifunctional gap-plasmon metasurfaces for visible light: polarization-controlled unidirectional surface plasmon excitation and beam steering at normal incidence,"<p>Integration of multiple diversified functionalities into a single, planar and ultra-compact device has become an emerging research area with fascinating possibilities for realization of very dense integration and miniaturization in photonics that requires addressing formidable challenges, particularly for operation in the visible range. Here we design, fabricate and experimentally demonstrate bifunctional gap-plasmon metasurfaces for visible light, allowing for simultaneous polarization-controlled unidirectional surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excitation and beam steering at normal incidence. The designed bifunctional metasurfaces, consisting of anisotropic gap-plasmon resonator arrays, produce two different linear phase gradients along the same direction for respective linear polarizations of incident light, resulting in distinctly different functionalities realized by the same metasurface. The proof-of-concept fabricated metasurfaces exhibit efficient (&gt;25% on average) unidirectional (extinction ratio &gt;20&#8201;dB) SPP excitation within the wavelength range of 600&#8211;650&#8201;nm when illuminated with normally incident light polarized in the direction of the phase gradient. At the same time, broadband (580&#8211;700&#8201;nm) beam steering (30.6&#176;&#8211;37.9&#176;) is realized when normally incident light is polarized perpendicularly to the phase gradient direction.

original article,Ultrafast z-scanning for high-efficiency laser micro-machining,"<p>High-throughput laser micro-machining demands precise control of the laser beam position to achieve optimal efficiency, but existing methods can be both time-consuming and cost-prohibitive. In this paper, we demonstrate a new high-throughput micro-machining technique based on rapidly scanning the laser focal point along the optical axis using an acoustically driven variable focal length lens. Our results show that this scanning method enables higher machining rates over a range of defocus distances and that the effect becomes more significant as the laser energy is increased. In a specific example of silicon, we achieve a nearly threefold increase in the machining rate, while maintaining sharp side walls and a small spot size.
