original article,Ultrahigh-resolution nonlinear optical imaging of the armchair orientation in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides,"<p>We used nonlinear laser scanning optical microscopy to study atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and revealed, with unprecedented resolution, the orientational distribution of armchair directions and their degree of organization in the two-dimensional (2D) crystal lattice. In particular, we carried out polarization-resolved second-harmonic generation (PSHG) imaging for monolayer WS<sub>2</sub> and obtained, with high-precision, the orientation of the main crystallographic axis (armchair orientation) for each individual 120 &#215; 120&#8201;nm<sup>2</sup> pixel of the 2D crystal area. Such nanoscale resolution was realized by fitting the experimental PSHG images, obtained with sub-micron precision, to a new generalized theoretical model that accounts for the nonlinear optical properties of TMDs. This enabled us to distinguish between different crystallographic domains, locate boundaries and reveal fine structure. As a consequence, we can calculate the mean orientational average of armchair angle distributions in specific regions of interest and define the corresponding standard deviation as a figure-of-merit for the 2D crystal quality.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser, Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas, Heraklion Crete, 71110, Greece', 'authors': ['Sotiris Psilodimitrakopoulos', ',\xa0Leonidas Mouchliadis', ',\xa0Ioannis Paradisanos', ',\xa0Andreas Lemonis', ',\xa0George Kioseoglou', '\xa0&\xa0Emmanuel Stratakis']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Crete, Heraklion Crete, 71003, Greece', 'authors': ['Ioannis Paradisanos']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Technology, University of Crete, Heraklion Crete, 71003, Greece', 'authors': ['George Kioseoglou', '\xa0&\xa0Emmanuel Stratakis']}]",True,"['Sotiris Psilodimitrakopoulos', 'Leonidas Mouchliadis', 'Ioannis Paradisanos', 'Andreas Lemonis', 'George Kioseoglou', 'Emmanuel Stratakis']","Psilodimitrakopoulos, S., Mouchliadis, L., Paradisanos, I. et al.

original article,A real-time detection and positioning method for small and weak targets using a 1D morphology-based approach in 2D images,"<p>A small and weak target detection method is proposed in this work that outperforms all other methods in terms of real-time capability. It is the first time that two-dimensional (2D) images are processed using only one-dimensional1D structuring elements in a morphology-based approach, enabling the real-time hardware implementation of the whole image processing method. A parallel image readout and processing structure is introduced to achieve an ultra-low latency time on the order of nanoseconds, and a hyper-frame resolution in the time domain can be achieved by combining the row-by-row structure and the electrical rolling shutter technique. Experimental results suggest that the expected target can be successfully detected under various interferences with an accuracy of 0.1 pixels (1&#963;) under the worst sky night test condition and that a centroiding precision of better than 0.03 pixels (1&#963;) can be reached for static tests. The real-time detection method with high robustness and accuracy is attractive for application to all types of real-time small target detection systems, such as medical imaging, infrared surveillance, and target measurement and tracking, where an ultra-high processing speed is required.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China', 'authors': ['Min-Song Wei', ',\xa0Fei Xing', '\xa0&\xa0Zheng You']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Precision Measurement Technology and Instruments, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China', 'authors': ['Min-Song Wei', ',\xa0Fei Xing', '\xa0&\xa0Zheng You']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Min-Song Wei']}]",True,"['Min-Song Wei', 'Fei Xing', 'Zheng You']","Wei, M., Xing, F. & You, Z.

original article,Negative reflection and negative surface wave conversion from obliquely incident electromagnetic waves,"<p>Complete control of spatially propagating waves (PWs) and surface waves (SWs) is an ultimate goal that scientists and engineers seek for, in which negative reflection of PW and negative surface wave are two exotic phenomena. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an anisotropic digital coding metasurface capable of controlling both PWs and SWs with a single coding pattern. On the basis of the digital description of coding metasurfaces, a simple coding method is proposed to allow dual functionalities (either PW or SW manipulations) under two orthogonal polarizations at arbitrarily oblique incidences, thus improving the adaptability of digital coding metasurfaces in more practical circumstances. With elaborately designed ellipse-shaped coding particles, we experimentally demonstrate various functions under oblique incidences, including the negative reflection of PW, negative SW, anomalous reflection and their arbitrary combinations, all having good agreements with theoretical and numerical predictions. We believe that the proposed method may enable the digital coding metasurfaces to have broad applications in radar detections, wireless communications and imaging.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China', 'authors': ['Shuo Liu', ',\xa0Tie Jun Cui', ',\xa0Ahsan Noor', ',\xa0Zui Tao', ',\xa0Hao Chi Zhang', ',\xa0Guo Dong Bai', ',\xa0Yan Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Xiao Yang Zhou']}, {'address': 'Synergetic Innovation Center of Wireless Communication Technology, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China', 'authors': ['Shuo Liu', ',\xa0Tie Jun Cui', ',\xa0Ahsan Noor', ',\xa0Zui Tao', ',\xa0Hao Chi Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Guo Dong Bai']}, {'address': 'Centre of Intelligent Acoustics and Immersive Communications and School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, 710072, China', 'authors': ['Yan Yang']}, {'address': 'Jiangsu Xuantu Technology Co., Ltd., 12 Mozhou East Road, Nanjing, 211111, China', 'authors': ['Xiao Yang Zhou']}]",True,"['Shuo Liu', 'Tie Jun Cui', 'Ahsan Noor', 'Zui Tao', 'Hao Chi Zhang', 'Guo Dong Bai', 'Yan Yang', 'Xiao Yang Zhou']","Liu, S., Jun Cui, T., Noor, A. et al.

original article,Entanglement beating in free space through spin–orbit coupling,"<p>It is well known that the entanglement of a quantum state is invariant under local unitary transformations. This rule dictates, for example, that the entanglement of internal degrees of freedom of a photon remains invariant during free-space propagation. Here, we outline a scenario in which this paradigm does not hold. Using local Bell states engineered from classical vector vortex beams with non-separable degrees of freedom, the so-called classically entangled states, we demonstrate that the entanglement evolves during propagation, oscillating between maximally entangled (purely vector) and product states (purely scalar). We outline the spin&#8211;orbit interaction behind these novel propagation dynamics and confirm the results experimentally, demonstrating spin&#8211;orbit coupling in paraxial beams. This demonstration highlights a hitherto unnoticed property of classical entanglement and simultaneously offers a device for the on-demand delivery of vector states to targets, for example, for dynamic laser materials processing, switchable resolution within stimulated emission depletion (STED) systems, and a tractor beam for entanglement.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Applied Physics, University of Muenster, Muenster, D-48149, Germany', 'authors': ['Eileen Otte', '\xa0&\xa0Cornelia Denz']}, {'address': 'School of Physics, University of the Witwatersrand, Wits, 2050, South Africa', 'authors': ['Carmelo Rosales-Guzmán', ',\xa0Bienvenu Ndagano', '\xa0&\xa0Andrew Forbes']}]",True,"['Eileen Otte', 'Carmelo Rosales-Guzmán', 'Bienvenu Ndagano', 'Cornelia Denz', 'Andrew Forbes']","Otte, E., Rosales-Guzmán, C., Ndagano, B. et al.

original article,Spectroscopic stimulated Raman scattering imaging of highly dynamic specimens through matrix completion,"<p>Spectroscopic stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging generates chemical maps of intrinsic molecules, with no need for prior knowledge. Despite great advances in instrumentation, the acquisition speed for a spectroscopic SRS image stack is fundamentally bounded by the pixel integration time. In this work, we report three-dimensional sparsely sampled spectroscopic SRS imaging that measures ~20% of pixels throughout the stack. In conjunction with related work in low-rank matrix completion (e.g., the Netflix Prize), we develop a regularized non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to decompose the sub-sampled image stack into spectral signatures and concentration maps. This design enables an acquisition speed of 0.8&#8201;s per image stack, with 50 frames in the spectral domain and 40,000 pixels in the spatial domain, which is faster than the conventional raster laser-scanning scheme by one order of magnitude. Such speed allows real-time metabolic imaging of living fungi suspended in a growth medium while effectively maintaining the spatial and spectral resolutions. This work is expected to promote broad application of matrix completion in spectroscopic laser-scanning imaging.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, 02215, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Haonan Lin', '\xa0&\xa0Ji-Xin Cheng']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, 02215, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Chien-Sheng Liao', '\xa0&\xa0Ji-Xin Cheng']}, {'address': 'Vibronix, Inc., West Lafayette, 47907, IN, USA', 'authors': ['Pu Wang']}, {'address': 'Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, 47907, IN, USA', 'authors': ['Nan Kong']}]",True,"['Haonan Lin', 'Chien-Sheng Liao', 'Pu Wang', 'Nan Kong', 'Ji-Xin Cheng']","Lin, H., Liao, C., Wang, P. et al.
