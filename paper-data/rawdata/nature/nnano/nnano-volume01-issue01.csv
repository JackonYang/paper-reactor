review article,Making molecular machines work,"<p>In this review we chart recent advances in what is at once an old and very new field of endeavour &#8212; the achievement of control of motion at the molecular level including solid-state and surface-mounted rotors, and its natural progression to the development of synthetic molecular machines. Besides a discussion of design principles used to control linear and rotary motion in such molecular systems, this review will address the advances towards the construction of synthetic machines that can perform useful functions. Approaches taken by several research groups to construct wholly synthetic molecular machines and devices are compared. This will be illustrated with molecular rotors, elevators, valves, transporters, muscles and other motor functions used to develop smart materials. The demonstration of molecular machinery is highlighted through recent examples of systems capable of effecting macroscopic movement through concerted molecular motion. Several approaches to illustrate how molecular motor systems have been used to accomplish work are discussed. We will conclude with prospects for future developments in this exciting field of nanotechnology.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Organic and Molecular Inorganic Chemistry, Stratingh Institute, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 4, Groningen, 9747 AG, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Wesley R.

letter,Torsional electromechanical quantum oscillations in carbon nanotubes,"<p>Carbon nanotubes can be distinctly metallic or semiconducting depending on their diameter and chirality. Here we show that continuously varying the chirality by mechanical torsion can induce conductance oscillations, which can be attributed to metal&#8211;semiconductor periodic transitions. The phenomenon is observed in multiwalled carbon nanotubes, where both the torque and the current are shown to be carried predominantly by the outermost wall. The oscillation period with torsion is consistent with the theoretical shifting of the corners of the first Brillouin zone of graphene across different sub-bands allowed in the nanotube. Beyond a critical torsion, the conductance irreversibly drops due to torsional failure, allowing us to determine the torsional strength of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes could be ideal torsional springs for nanoscopic pendulums, because electromechanical detection of motion could replace the microscopic detection techniques used at present. Our experiments indicate that carbon nanotubes could be used as electronic sensors of torsional motion in nanoelectromechanical systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials and Interfaces, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel', 'authors': ['Tzahi Cohen-Karni', ',\xa0Lior Segev', ',\xa0Onit Srur-Lavi', '\xa0&\xa0Ernesto Joselevich']}, {'address': 'Chemical Research Support, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel', 'authors': ['Sidney R.

letter,Giant piezoresistance effect in silicon nanowires,"<p>The piezoresistance effect of silicon has been widely used in mechanical sensors, and is now being actively explored in order to improve the performance of silicon transistors. In fact, strain engineering is now considered to be one of the most promising strategies for developing high-performance sub-10-nm silicon devices. Interesting electromechanical properties have been observed in carbon nanotubes. In this paper we report that Si nanowires possess an unusually large piezoresistance effect compared with bulk. For example, the longitudinal piezoresistance coefficient along the &#12296;111&#12297; direction increases with decreasing diameter for p-type Si nanowires, reaching as high as &#8722;3,550&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;11</sup>&#160;Pa<sup>&#8211;1</sup>, in comparison with a bulk value of &#8722;94&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;11</sup>&#160;Pa<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Strain-induced carrier mobility change and surface modifications have been shown to have clear influence on piezoresistance coefficients. This giant piezoresistance effect in Si nanowires may have significant implications in nanowire-based flexible electronics, as well as in nanoelectromechanical systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Materials Science Division, University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Rongrui He', '\xa0&\xa0Peidong Yang']}]",False,"['Rongrui He', 'Peidong Yang']","He, R., Yang, P.

letter,A nanoplasmonic molecular ruler for measuring nuclease activity and DNA footprinting,"<p>Interactions between nucleic acids and proteins are essential to genetic information processing. The detection of size changes in nucleic acids is the key to mapping such interactions, and usually requires substrates with fluorescent, electrochemical or radioactive labels. Recently, methods have been developed to tether DNA to highly water-soluble Au nanoparticles, and nanoparticle pairs linked by DNA have been used to measure nanoscale distances. Here we demonstrate a molecular ruler in which double-stranded DNA is attached to a Au nanoparticle. The change in plasmon resonance wavelength of individual Au&#8211;DNA conjugates depends on the length of the DNA and can be measured with subnanometre axial resolution. An average wavelength shift of approximately 1.24&#160;nm is observed per DNA base pair. This system allows for a label-free, quantitative, real-time measurement of nuclease activity and also serves as a new DNA footprinting platform, which can accurately detect and map the specific binding of a protein to DNA.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, Biomolecular Nanotechnology Center, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Gang L.

article,Carbon nanotube superconducting quantum interference device,"<p>A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) Josephson junctions is presented. Quantum confinement in each junction induces a discrete quantum dot (QD) energy level structure, which can be controlled with two lateral electrostatic gates. In addition, a backgate electrode can vary the transparency of the QD barriers, thus permitting change in the hybridization of the QD states with the superconducting contacts. The gates are also used to directly tune the quantum phase interference of the Cooper pairs circulating in the SQUID ring. Optimal modulation of the switching current with magnetic flux is achieved when both QD junctions are in the &#8216;on&#8217; or &#8216;off&#8217; state. In particular, the SQUID design establishes that these CNT Josephson junctions can be used as gate-controlled &#960;-junctions; that is, the sign of the current&#8211;phase relation across the CNT junctions can be tuned with a gate voltage. The CNT-SQUIDs are sensitive local magnetometers, which are very promising for the study of magnetization reversal of an individual magnetic particle or molecule placed on one of the two CNT Josephson junctions.</p>",,"[{'address': ""Centre d'Elaboration des Matériaux et d'Etudes Structurales, CEMES-CNRS, 29 rue Jeanne Marvig, Toulouse, Cedex 4, 31055, France"", 'authors': ['J.-P.

article,Sorting carbon nanotubes by electronic structure using density differentiation,"<p>The heterogeneity of as-synthesized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) precludes their widespread application in electronics, optics and sensing. We report on the sorting of carbon nanotubes by diameter, bandgap and electronic type using structure-discriminating surfactants to engineer subtle differences in their buoyant densities. Using the scalable technique of density-gradient ultracentrifugation, we have isolated narrow distributions of SWNTs in which &gt;97% are within a 0.02-nm-diameter range. Furthermore, using competing mixtures of surfactants, we have produced bulk quantities of SWNTs of predominantly a single electronic type.

article,Linker-free directed assembly of high-performance integrated devices based on nanotubes and nanowires,"<p>Advanced electronic devices based on carbon nanotubes (NTs) and various types of nanowires (NWs) could have a role in next-generation semiconductor architectures. However, the lack of a general fabrication method has held back the development of these devices for practical applications. Here we report an assembly strategy for devices based on NTs and NWs. Inert surface molecular patterns were used to direct the adsorption and alignment of NTs and NWs on bare surfaces to form device structures without the use of linker molecules. Substrate bias further enhanced the amount of NT and NW adsorption. Significantly, as all the processing steps can be performed with conventional microfabrication facilities, our method is readily accessible to the present semiconductor industry. We use this method to demonstrate large-scale assembly of NT- and NW-based integrated devices and their applications.

article,Digital memory device based on tobacco mosaic virus conjugated with nanoparticles,"<p>Nanostructured viruses are attractive for use as templates for ordering quantum dots to make self-assembled building blocks for next-generation electronic devices. So far, only a few types of electronic devices have been fabricated from biomolecules due to the lack of charge transport through biomolecular junctions. Here, we show a novel electronic memory effect by incorporating platinum nanoparticles into tobacco mosaic virus. The memory effect is based on conductance switching, which leads to the occurrence of bistable states with an on/off ratio larger than three orders of magnitude. The mechanism of this process is attributed to charge trapping in the nanoparticles for data storage and a tunnelling process in the high conductance state.
