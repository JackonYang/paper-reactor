review article,Inorganic nanotubes and fullerene-like nanoparticles,"<p>Although graphite, with its anisotropic two-dimensional lattice, is the stable form of carbon under ambient conditions, on nanometre length scales it forms zero- and one-dimensional structures, namely fullerenes and nanotubes, respectively. This virtue is not limited to carbon and, in recent years, fullerene-like structures and nanotubes have been made from numerous compounds with layered two-dimensional structures. Furthermore, crystalline and polycrystalline nanotubes of pure elements and compounds with quasi-isotropic (three-dimensional) unit cells have also been synthesized, usually by making use of solid templates. These findings open up vast opportunities for the synthesis and study of new kinds of nanostructures with properties that may differ significantly from the corresponding bulk materials. Various potential applications have been proposed for the inorganic nanotubes and the fullerene-like phases. Fullerene-like nanoparticles have been shown to exhibit excellent solid lubrication behaviour, suggesting many applications in, for example, the automotive and aerospace industries, home appliances, and recently for medical technology. Various other potential applications, in catalysis, rechargeable batteries, drug delivery, solar cells and electronics have also been proposed.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Head of Department of Materials and Interfaces; Director of the Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for Nanoscale Science; holder of the Drake Family Professorial Chair in Nanotechnology, Weizmann Institute of Science', 'authors': ['R.

letter,Direct growth of aligned carbon nanotubes on bulk metals,"<p>There are several advantages of growing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) directly on bulk metals, for example in the formation of robust CNT&#8211;metal contacts during growth. Usually, aligned CNTs are grown either by using thin catalyst layers predeposited on substrates or through vapour-phase catalyst delivery. The latter method, although flexible, is unsuitable for growing CNTs directly on metallic substrates. Here we report on the growth of aligned multiwalled CNTs on a metallic alloy, Inconel 600 (Inconel), using vapour-phase catalyst delivery. The CNTs are well anchored to the substrate and show excellent electrical contact with it. These CNT&#8211;metal structures were then used to fabricate double-layer capacitors and field-emitter devices, which demonstrated improved performance over previously designed CNT structures. Inconel coatings can also be used to grow CNTs on other metallic substrates. This finding overcomes the substrate limitation for nanotube growth which should assist the development of future CNT-related technologies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 Eighth Street, Troy, 12180, New York, USA', 'authors': ['S.

letter,Parallel patterning of nanoparticles via electrodynamic focusing of charged aerosols,"<p>The development of nanodevices that exploit the unique properties of nanoparticles will require high-speed methods for patterning surfaces with nanoparticles over large areas and with high resolution. Moreover, the technique will need to work with both conducting and non-conducting surfaces. Here we report an ion-induced parallel-focusing approach that satisfies all requirements. Charged monodisperse aerosol nanoparticles are deposited onto a surface patterned with a photoresist while ions of the same polarity are introduced into the deposition chamber in the presence of an applied electric field. The ions accumulate on the photoresist, modifying the applied field to produce nanoscopic electrostatic lenses that focus the nanoparticles onto the exposed parts of the surface. We have demonstrated that the technique could produce high-resolution patterns at high speed on both conducting (p-type silicon) and non-conducting (silica) surfaces. Moreover, the feature sizes in the nanoparticle patterns were significantly smaller than those in the original photoresist pattern.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National CRI Center for Nano Particle Control, Institute of Advanced Machinery and Design, School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-742, Korea', 'authors': ['Hyoungchul Kim', ',\xa0Jaehyun Kim', ',\xa0Hongjoo Yang', ',\xa0Jeongsoo Suh', ',\xa0Taeyoung Kim', ',\xa0Bangwoo Han', ',\xa0Sungwon Kim', ',\xa0Dae Seong Kim', ',\xa0Peter V.

letter,Mechanochemistry: targeted delivery of single molecules,"<p>The use of scanning probe microscopy-based techniques to manipulate single molecules and deliver them in a precisely controlled manner to a specific target represents a significant nanotechnological challenge. The ultimate physical limit in the design and fabrication of organic surfaces can be reached using this approach. Here we show that the atomic force microscope (AFM), which has been used extensively to investigate the stretching of individual molecules, can deliver and immobilize single molecules, one at a time, on a surface. Reactive polymer molecules, attached at one end to an AFM tip, are brought into contact with a modified silicon substrate to which they become linked by a chemical reaction. When the AFM tip is pulled away from the surface, the resulting mechanical force causes the weakest bond &#8212; the one between the tip and polymer &#8212; to break. This process transfers the polymer molecule to the substrate where it can be modified by further chemical reactions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Unité de Chimie et Physique des Hauts Polymères and Research Center in Micro- and Nanoscopic Materials and Electronic Devices, Université catholique de Louvain, Place Croix du Sud 1, Louvain-la-Neuve, 1348, Belgium', 'authors': ['Anne-Sophie Duwez', '\xa0&\xa0Stéphane Cuenot']}, {'address': ""Centre d'Etude et de Recherche sur les Macromolécules, University of Liège, B6 Sart-Tilman, Liège, 4000, Belgium"", 'authors': ['Christine Jérôme', ',\xa0Sabine Gabriel', '\xa0&\xa0Robert Jérôme']}, {'address': 'Dipartimento di Chimica “G.

letter,Metal-enhanced fluorescence of colloidal nanocrystals with nanoscale control,"<p>Engineering the spectral properties of fluorophores, such as the enhancement of luminescence intensity, can be achieved through coupling with surface plasmons in metallic nanostructures. This process, referred to as metal-enhanced fluorescence, offers promise for a range of applications, including LEDs, sensor technology, microarrays and single-molecule studies. It becomes even more appealing when applied to colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, which exhibit size-dependent optical properties, have high photochemical stability, and are characterized by broad excitation spectra and narrow emission bands. Other approaches have relied upon the coupling of fluorophores (typically organic dyes) to random distributions of metallic nanoparticles or nanoscale roughness in metallic films. Here, we develop a new strategy based on the highly reproducible fabrication of ordered arrays of gold nanostructures coupled to CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals dispersed in a polymer blend. We demonstrate the possibility of obtaining precise control and a high spatial selectivity of the fluorescence enhancement process.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Nanotechnology Laboratory of CNR-INFM, IIT Research Unit, ISUFI, University of Lecce, Via per Arnesano, Lecce, 73100, Italy', 'authors': ['P.

We achieved 85% selectivity of DWNTs through a semi-empirical analysis of the relationships between the tube type and mean diameter and between the mean diameter and the film thickness of sputtered Fe, which was used here as a catalyst. Accordingly, catalysts were engineered for optimum DWNT selectivity by precisely controlling the Fe film thickness. The high efficiency of water-assisted CVD enabled the synthesis of nearly catalyst-free DWNT forests with a carbon purity of 99.95%, which could be templated into organized structures from lithographically patterned catalyst islands.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Center for Advanced Carbon Materials, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, 305-8565, Ibaraki, Japan', 'authors': ['Takeo Yamada', ',\xa0Tatsunori Namai', ',\xa0Kenji Hata', ',\xa0Don N.

article,High flexibility of DNA on short length scales probed by atomic force microscopy,"<p>The mechanics of DNA bending on intermediate length scales (5&#8211;100&#160;nm) plays a key role in many cellular processes, and is also important in the fabrication of artificial DNA structures, but previous experimental studies of DNA mechanics have focused on longer length scales than these. We use high-resolution atomic force microscopy on individual DNA molecules to obtain a direct measurement of the bending energy function appropriate for scales down to 5&#160;nm. Our measurements imply that the elastic energy of highly bent DNA conformations is lower than predicted by classical elasticity models such as the worm-like chain (WLC) model. For example, we found that on short length scales, spontaneous large-angle bends are many times more prevalent than predicted by the WLC model. We test our data and model with an interlocking set of consistency checks. Our analysis also shows how our model is compatible with previous experiments, which have sometimes been viewed as confirming the WLC.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, 02142, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Paul A.

article,Rare earth nanoparticles prevent retinal degeneration induced by intracellular peroxides,"<p>Photoreceptor cells are incessantly bombarded with photons of light, which, along with the cells' high rate of oxygen metabolism, continuously exposes them to elevated levels of toxic reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). Vacancy-engineered mixed-valence-state cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria particles) scavenge ROIs. Our data show that nanoceria particles prevent increases in the intracellular concentrations of ROIs in primary cell cultures of rat retina and, in vivo, prevent loss of vision due to light-induced degeneration of photoreceptor cells. These data indicate that the nanoceria particles may be effective in inhibiting the progression of ROI-induced cell death, which is thought to be involved in macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and other blinding diseases, as well as the ROI-induced death of other cell types in diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, stroke and so on.
