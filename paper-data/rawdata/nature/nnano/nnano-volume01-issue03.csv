review article,Electron transport in molecular junctions,"<p>Building an electronic device using individual molecules is one of the ultimate goals in nanotechnology. To achieve this it will be necessary to measure, control and understand electron transport through molecules attached to electrodes. Substantial progress has been made over the past decade and we present here an overview of some of the recent advances. Topics covered include molecular wires, two-terminal switches and diodes, three-terminal transistor-like devices and hybrid devices that use various different signals (light, magnetic fields, and chemical and mechanical signals) to control electron transport in molecules. We also discuss further issues, including molecule&#8211;electrode contacts, local heating- and current-induced instabilities, stochastic fluctuations and the development of characterization tools.</p>",[],False,"[""N.

letter,Experimental realization of suspended atomic chains composed of different atomic species,"<p>Research into nanostructured materials frequently relates to pure substances. This contrasts with industrial applications, where chemical doping or alloying is often used to enhance the electrical or mechanical properties of materials. However, the controlled preparation of doped nanomaterials has been much more difficult than expected because the increased surface-area-to-volume ratio can, for instance, lead to the expulsion of impurities (self-purification). For nanostructured alloys, the influence of growth methods and the atomic structure on self-purification is still open to investigation. Here, we explore, experimentally and with molecular dynamics simulations, to what extent alloying persists in the limit that a binary metal is mechanically stretched to a linear chain of atoms. Our results reveal a gradual evolution of the arrangement of the different atomic elements in the narrowest region of the chain, where impurities may be expelled to the surface or enclosed during elongation.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

letter,Epitaxial growth of silicon nanowires using an aluminium catalyst,"<p>Silicon nanowires have been identified as important components for future electronic and sensor nanodevices. So far gold has dominated as the catalyst for growing Si nanowires via the vapour&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid (VLS) mechanism. Unfortunately, gold traps electrons and holes in Si and poses a serious contamination problem for Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processing. Although there are some reports on the use of non-gold catalysts for Si nanowire growth, either the growth requires high temperatures and/or the catalysts are not compatible with CMOS requirements. From a technological standpoint, a much more attractive catalyst material would be aluminium, as it is a standard metal in Si process lines. Here we report for the first time the epitaxial growth of Al-catalysed Si nanowires and suggest that growth proceeds via a vapour&#8211;solid&#8211;solid (VSS) rather than a VLS mechanism. It is also found that the tapering of the nanowires can be strongly reduced by lowering the growth temperature.</p>",[],False,"[""Yewu Wang"", ""Volker Schmidt"", ""Stephan Senz"", ""Ulrich G\u00f6sele""]","Wang, Y., Schmidt, V., Senz, S. et al.

letter,Programmable self-assembly of metal ions inside artificial DNA duplexes,"<p>The ultimate bottom-up approach for the construction of functional nanosystems requires the precise arrangement of atoms and molecules in three dimensions. DNA is currently one of the most prominent molecules able to self-assemble into complex networks and is therefore regarded as the &#8216;silicon of the nano-world&#8217;. Metals and metal ions, in contrast, are the atomic building-blocks needed in such materials to establish functions such as electrical conductivity or magnetism.

letter,Controlled patterning of aligned self-assembled peptide nanotubes,"<p>Controlling the spatial organization of objects at the nanoscale is a key challenge in enabling their technological application. Biomolecular assemblies are attractive nanostructures owing to their biocompatibility, straightforward chemical modifiability, inherent molecular recognition properties and their availability for bottom-up fabrication. Aromatic peptide nanotubes are self-assembled nanostructures with unique physical and chemical stability and remarkable mechanical rigidity. Their application in the fabrication of metallic nanowires and in the improvement of the sensitivity of electrochemical biosensors have already been demonstrated. Here we show the formation of a vertically aligned nanoforest by axial unidirectional growth of a dense array of these peptide tubes. We also achieved horizontal alignment of the tubes through noncovalent coating of the tubes with a ferrofluid and the application of an external magnetic field. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability to form a two-dimensional dense array of nanotube assemblies with either vertical or horizontal patterns.</p>",[],False,"[""Meital Reches"", ""Ehud Gazit""]","Reches, M., Gazit, E.

article,Controlled buckling of semiconductor nanoribbons for stretchable electronics,"<p>Control over the composition, shape, spatial location and/or geometrical configuration of semiconductor nanostructures is important for nearly all applications of these materials. Here we report a mechanical strategy for creating certain classes of three-dimensional shapes in nanoribbons that would be difficult to generate in other ways. This approach involves the combined use of lithographically patterned surface chemistry to provide spatial control over adhesion sites, and elastic deformations of a supporting substrate to induce well-controlled local displacements. We show that precisely engineered buckling geometries can be created in nanoribbons of GaAs and Si in this manner and that these configurations can be described quantitatively with analytical models of the mechanics. As one application example, we show that some of these structures provide a route to electronics (and optoelectronics) with extremely high levels of stretchability (up to &#8764;100%), compressibility (up to &#8764;25%) and bendability (with curvature radius down to &#8764;5 mm).</p>",[],False,"[""Yugang Sun"", ""Won Mook Choi"", ""Hanqing Jiang"", ""Yonggang Y.

article,Ge/Si nanowire mesoscopic Josephson junctions,"<p>The controlled growth of nanowires (NWs) with dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelengths of the charge carriers allows fundamental investigations of quantum confinement phenomena. Here, we present studies of proximity-induced superconductivity in undoped Ge/Si core/shell NW heterostructures contacted by superconducting leads. By using a top gate electrode to modulate the carrier density in the NW, the critical supercurrent can be tuned from zero to greater than 100&#160;nA. Furthermore, discrete sub-bands form in the NW due to confinement in the radial direction, which results in stepwise increases in the critical current as a function of gate voltage. Transport measurements on these superconductor&#8211;NW&#8211;superconductor devices reveal high-order (n&#160;=&#160;25) resonant multiple Andreev reflections, indicating that the NW channel is smooth and the charge transport is highly coherent. The ability to create and control coherent superconducting ordered states in semiconductor&#8211;superconductor hybrid nanostructures allows for new opportunities in the study of fundamental low-dimensional superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Jie Xiang"", ""A.

article,Rapid and label-free nanomechanical detection of biomarker transcripts in human RNA,"<p>The availability of entire genome sequences has triggered the development of microarrays for clinical diagnostics that measure the expression levels of specific genes. Methods that involve labelling can achieve picomolar detection sensitivity, but they are costly, labour-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, target amplification or biochemical labelling can influence the original signal. We have improved the biosensitivity of label-free cantilever-array sensors by orders of magnitude to detect mRNA biomarker candidates in total cellular RNA. Differential gene expression of the gene 1-8U, a potential marker for cancer progression or viral infections, has been observed in a complex background. The measurements provide results within minutes at the picomolar level without target amplification, and are sensitive to base mismatches. This qualifies the technology as a rapid method to validate biomarkers that reveal disease risk, disease progression or therapy response.
