review article,Technology and metrology of new electronic materials and devices,"<p>Scaling of the metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistor has been the basis of the semiconductor industry for nearly 30 years. Traditional materials have been pushed to their limits, which means that entirely new materials (such as high-&#954; gate dielectrics and metal gate electrodes), and new device structures are required. These materials and structures will probably allow MOS devices to remain competitive for at least another ten years. Beyond this timeframe, entirely new device structures (such as nanowire or molecular devices) and computational paradigms will almost certainly be needed to improve performance. The development of new nanoscale electronic devices and materials places increasingly stringent requirements on metrology.</p>",[],False,"[""Eric Vogel""]","Vogel, E.

letter,Electrically driven thermal light emission from individual single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>Light emission from nanostructures exhibits rich quantum effects and has broad applications. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are one-dimensional metals or semiconductors in which large numbers of electronic states in narrow energy ranges, known as van Hove singularities, can lead to strong spectral transitions. Photoluminescence and electroluminescence involving interband transitions and excitons have been observed in semiconducting SWNTs, but are not expected in metallic tubes owing to non-radiative relaxations. Here, we show that, under low bias voltages, a suspended quasi-metallic SWNT (QM-SWNT) emits light owing to Joule heating, displaying strong peaks in the visible and infrared, corresponding to interband transitions. This is a result of thermal light emission in a one-dimensional system, in stark contrast with featureless blackbody-like emission observed in large bundles of SWNTs or multiwalled nanotubes. This allows for probing of the electronic temperature and non-equilibrium hot optical phonons in Joule-heated QM-SWNTs.</p>",[],False,"[""David Mann"", ""Y. K.

letter,Rare-earth solid-state qubits,"<p>Quantum bits (qubits) are the basic building blocks of any quantum computer. Superconducting qubits have been created with a top-down approach that integrates superconducting devices into macroscopic electrical circuits, and electron-spin qubits have been demonstrated in quantum dots. The phase coherence time (&#964;<sub>2</sub>) and the single qubit figure of merit (Q<sub>M</sub>) of superconducting and electron-spin qubits are similar &#8212; at &#964;<sub>2</sub> &#8764; &#181;s and Q<sub>M</sub> &#8764; 10&#8211;1,000 below 100 mK &#8212; and it should be possible to scale up these systems, which is essential for the development of any useful quantum computer. Bottom-up approaches based on dilute ensembles of spins have achieved much larger values of &#964;<sub>2</sub> (up to tens of milliseconds; refs&#160;), but these systems cannot be scaled up, although some proposals for qubits based on two-dimensional nanostructures should be scalable. Here we report that a new family of spin qubits based on rare-earth ions demonstrates values of &#964;<sub>2</sub> (&#8764;50 &#181;s) and Q<sub>M</sub> (&#8764;1,400) at 2.5 K, which suggests that rare-earth qubits may, in principle, be suitable for scalable quantum information processing at <sup>4</sup>He temperatures.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

letter,Self-assembly of an organic–inorganic block copolymer for nano-ordered ceramics,"<p>Self-assembly is a promising approach for achieving controlled nanoscale architectures in ceramics. The addition of ceramic-forming precursors to templating agents such as self-assembled surfactants or organic block copolymers (BCPs) has thus far been the primary route to forming ordered nanoporous oxides and nanostructured non-oxide ceramics. In spite of its viability, however, this approach has several intrinsic shortcomings, including: (1) stringent requirements for amphiphilicity between template and precursor, lack of which may lead to macro-phase separation and loss of nano-scale order; (2) morphologies that can change uncontrollably with varying amounts of added ceramic precursor. Here we report a novel single-source ceramic precursor, based on a hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic BCP of polynorbornene&#8211;decaborane, that enables the formation of ordered ceramic nanostructures with tunable morphology and composition. In particular, we describe the synthesis of nanostructured boron carbonitride and mesoporous boron nitride, the latter of which exhibits the highest reported surface area for this material to date.</p>",[],False,"[""Patrick R.

letter,In vivo biodistribution and highly efficient tumour targeting of carbon nanotubes in mice,"<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) exhibit unique size, shape and physical properties that make them promising candidates for biological applications. Here, we investigate the biodistribution of radio-labelled SWNTs in mice by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET), ex vivo biodistribution and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that SWNTs that are functionalized with phospholipids bearing polyethylene-glycol (PEG) are surprisingly stable in vivo. The effect of PEG chain length on the biodistribution and circulation of the SWNTs is studied. Effectively PEGylated SWNTs exhibit relatively long blood circulation times and low uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Efficient targeting of integrin positive tumour in mice is achieved with SWNTs coated with PEG chains linked to an arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid (RGD) peptide. A high tumour accumulation is attributed to the multivalent effect of the SWNTs. The Raman signatures of SWNTs are used to directly probe the presence of nanotubes in mice tissues and confirm the radio-label-based results.</p>",[],False,"[""Zhuang Liu"", ""Weibo Cai"", ""Lina He"", ""Nozomi Nakayama"", ""Kai Chen"", ""Xiaoming Sun"", ""Xiaoyuan Chen"", ""Hongjie Dai""]","Liu, Z., Cai, W., He, L. et al.

article,Size-dependent structure of MoS2 nanocrystals,"<p>Molybdenum disulphide nanostructures are of interest for a wide variety of nanotechnological applications ranging from the potential use of inorganic nanotubes in nanoelectronics to the active use of nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we use atom-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy to systematically map and classify the atomic-scale structure of triangular MoS<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals as a function of size. Instead of a smooth variation as expected from the bulk structure of MoS<sub>2</sub>, we observe a very strong size dependence for the cluster morphology and electronic structure driven by the tendency to optimize the sulphur excess present at the cluster edges. By analysing of the atomic-scale structure of clusters, we identify the origin of the structural transitions occurring at unique cluster sizes. The novel findings suggest that good size control during the synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanostructures may be used for the production of chemically or optically active MoS<sub>2</sub> nanomaterials with superior performance.</p>",[],False,"[""Jeppe V.

article,Effect of supramolecular structure on polymer nanofibre elasticity,"<p>Polymer materials of reduced size and dimensionality, such as thin films, polymer nanofibres and nanotubes, exhibit exceptional mechanical properties compared with those of their macroscopic counterparts. We discuss here the abrupt increase in Young's modulus in polymer nanofibres. Using scaling estimation we show that this effect occurs when, in the amorphous (non-crystalline) part of the nanofibres, the transversal size of regions consisting of orientation-correlated macromolecules is comparable to the nanofibre diameter, thereby resulting in confinement of the supramolecular structure. We suggest that in polymer nanofibres the resulting supramolecular microstructure plays a more dominant role in the deformation process than previously thought, challenging the commonly held view that surface effects are most significant. The concept we develop also provides a way to interpret the observed&#8212;but not yet understood&#8212;temperature dependence of Young's modulus in nanofibres of different diameters.</p>",[],False,"[""Arkadii Arinstein"", ""Michael Burman"", ""Oleg Gendelman"", ""Eyal Zussman""]","Arinstein, A., Burman, M., Gendelman, O. et al.
