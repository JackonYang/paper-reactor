review article,Fluid flow in carbon nanotubes and nanopipes,"<p>Nanoscale carbon tubes and pipes can be readily fabricated using self-assembly techniques and they have useful electrical, optical and mechanical properties. The transport of liquids along their central pores is now of considerable interest both for testing classical theories of fluid flow at the nanoscale and for potential nanofluidic device applications. In this review we consider evidence for novel fluid flow in carbon nanotubes and pipes that approaches frictionless transport. Methods for controlling such flow and for creating functional device architectures are described and possible applications are discussed.</p>",[],False,"[""M. Whitby"", ""N.

letter,Rolling a single molecular wheel at the atomic scale,"<p>The design of a single-molecule machine consisting of functional components requires a detailed understanding of its mechanical motion. The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) is the only available tool for driving and imaging such a nanoscale machine on a surface. Both lateral hopping motions and conformational changes of single molecules can be induced using the STM tip. However, no rolling of a wheel has been demonstrated so far at the nanoscale, even though this is a very useful motion at the macroscopic scale. Here we show how the rolling of a single molecule equipped with two wheels (0.8&#160;nm in diameter) can be induced by the STM tip. The characteristics of the rolling are recorded in the STM feedback loop manipulation signal and in real time. We capture unambiguous signatures of the conformational change happening during the rolling. Our approach of controlling the intramolecular mechanics provides a path towards the bottom-up assembly of more complex molecular machines.</p>",[],False,"[""L. Grill"", ""K.-H. Rieder"", ""F.

letter,Supramolecular gratings for tuneable confinement of electrons on metal surfaces,"<p>The engineering of electron wave functions in reduced dimensions has allowed researchers to explore and visualize fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and has also led to new ideas for advanced materials and devices. The scanning tunnelling microscope, in particular, has been used to create two-dimensional structures such as quantum corrals by moving individual atoms on metal surfaces and then probing the quasi two-dimensional surface state electron gases confined therein. However, this serial approach is time-consuming and not suited to producing ensembles of nanostructures for the control of electrons. Here we introduce a novel bottom-up method for the fabrication of nanoscale confinement structures on the Ag(111) surface. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy data show that self-assembled molecular gratings act as one-dimensional resonators, and allow us to tune the characteristics of quantum-well states. We also demonstrate zero-dimensional confinement in quantum corrals down to 2&#160;&#215;&#160;5&#160;nm in size by positioning single Fe atoms, which act as additional electron reflectors, in the molecular gratings.</p>",[],False,"[""Y.

letter,A nanoscale probe for fluidic and ionic transport,"<p>Surface science and molecular biology are often concerned with systems governed by fluid dynamics at the nanoscale, where different physical behaviour is expected. With advances in nanofabrication techniques, the study of fluid dynamics around a nano-object or in a nano channel is now more accessible experimentally and has become an active field of research. However, developing nanoscale probes that can act as flow sensors and that can be easily integrated remains difficult. Many studies demonstrate that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have outstanding potential for nanoscale sensing, acting as strain or charge sensors in chemical and biological environments. Although nanotube flow sensors composed of bulk nanotubes have been demonstrated, they are not readily miniaturized to nanoscale dimensions. Here we report that individual carbon nanotube transistors of &#8764;2 nm diameter, incorporated into microfluidic channels, locally sense the change in electrostatic potential induced by the flow of an ionic solution. We demonstrate that the nanotube conductance changes in response to the flow rate, functioning as a nanoscale flow sensor.</p>",[],False,"[""Bertrand Bourlon"", ""Joyce Wong"", ""Csilla Mik\u00f3"", ""L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Forr\u00f3"", ""Marc Bockrath""]","Bourlon, B., Wong, J., Mikó, C. et al.A nanoscale probe for fluidic and ionic transport.

letter,Cellular uptake of functionalized carbon nanotubes is independent of functional group and cell type,"<p>The development of nanomaterials for biomedical and biotechnological applications is an area of research that holds great promise and intense interest, and carbon-based nanostructures in particular, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are attracting an increasing level of attention. One of the key advantages that CNTs offer is the possibility of effectively crossing biological barriers, which would allow their use in the delivery of therapeutically active molecules. Our laboratories have been investigating the use of CNTs in biomedical applications, and in particular as nanovectors for therapeutic agent delivery. The interaction between cells and CNTs is a critical issue that will determine any future biological application of such structures. Here we show that various types of functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) exhibit a capacity to be taken up by a wide range of cells and can intracellularly traffic through different cellular barriers.</p>",[],False,"[""Kostas Kostarelos"", ""Lara Lacerda"", ""Giorgia Pastorin"", ""Wei Wu"", ""S\u00e9bastien Wieckowski"", ""Jacqueline Luangsivilay"", ""Sylvie Godefroy"", ""Davide Pantarotto"", ""Jean-Paul Briand"", ""Sylviane Muller"", ""Maurizio Prato"", ""Alberto Bianco""]","Kostarelos, K., Lacerda, L., Pastorin, G. et al.

article,"Ultra-sensitive NEMS-based cantilevers for sensing, scanned probe and very high-frequency applications","<p>Scanning probe microscopies (SPM) and cantilever-based sensors generally use low-frequency mechanical devices of microscale dimensions or larger. Almost universally, off-chip methods are used to sense displacement in these devices, but this approach is not suitable for nanoscale devices. Nanoscale mechanical sensors offer a greatly enhanced performance that is unattainable with microscale devices. Here we describe the fabrication and operation of self-sensing nanocantilevers with fundamental mechanical resonances up to very high frequencies (VHF). These devices use integrated electronic displacement transducers based on piezoresistive thin metal films, permitting straightforward and optimal nanodevice readout. This non-optical transduction enables applications requiring previously inaccessible sensitivity and bandwidth, such as fast SPM and VHF force sensing. Detection of 127&#160;MHz cantilever vibrations is demonstrated with a thermomechanical-noise-limited displacement sensitivity of 39&#160;fm&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>. Our smallest devices, with dimensions approaching the mean free path at atmospheric pressure, maintain high resonance quality factors in ambient conditions. This enables chemisorption measurements in air at room temperature, with unprecedented mass resolution less than 1 attogram (10<sup>&#8722;18</sup>&#160;g).</p>",[],False,"[""Mo Li"", ""H. X.

article,A patterned anisotropic nanofluidic sieving structure for continuous-flow separation of DNA and proteins,"<p>Microfabricated regular sieving structures hold great promise as an alternative to gels to improve the speed and resolution of biomolecule separation. In contrast to disordered porous gel networks, these regular structures also provide well defined environments ideal for the study of molecular dynamics in confining spaces. However, the use of regular sieving structures has, to date, been limited to the separation of long DNA molecules, however separation of smaller, physiologically relevant macromolecules, such as proteins, still remains a challenge. Here we report a microfabricated anisotropic sieving structure consisting of a two-dimensional periodic nanofluidic filter array. The designed structural anisotropy causes different-sized or -charged biomolecules to follow distinct trajectories, leading to efficient separation. Continuous-flow size-based separation of DNA and proteins, as well as electrostatic separation of proteins, was achieved, demonstrating the potential use of this device as a generic molecular sieving structure for an integrated biomolecule sample preparation and analysis system.</p>",[],False,"[""Jianping Fu"", ""Reto B.
