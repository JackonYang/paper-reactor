review article,Applications of dip-pen nanolithography,"<p>The ability to tailor the chemical composition and structure of a surface at the sub-100-nm length scale is important for studying topics ranging from molecular electronics to materials assembly, and for investigating biological recognition at the single biomolecule level. Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) is a scanning probe microscopy-based nanofabrication technique that uniquely combines direct-write soft-matter compatibility with the high resolution and registry of atomic force microscopy (AFM), which makes it a powerful tool for depositing soft and hard materials, in the form of stable and functional architectures, on a variety of surfaces. The technology is accessible to any researcher who can operate an AFM instrument and is now used by more than 200 laboratories throughout the world. This article introduces DPN and reviews the rapid growth of the field of DPN-enabled research and applications over the past several years.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and International Institute for Nanotechnology, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, 60208–3113, Illinois', 'authors': ['Khalid Salaita', ',\xa0Yuhuang Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Chad A.

letter,A novel hybrid carbon material,"<p>Both fullerenes and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) exhibit many advantageous properties. Despite the similarities between these two forms of carbon, there have been very few attempts to physically merge them. We have discovered a novel hybrid material that combines fullerenes and SWNTs into a single structure in which the fullerenes are covalently bonded to the outer surface of the SWNTs. These fullerene-functionalized SWNTs, which we have termed NanoBuds, were selectively synthesized in two different one-step continuous methods, during which fullerenes were formed on iron-catalyst particles together with SWNTs during CO disproportionation. The field-emission characteristics of NanoBuds suggest that they may possess advantageous properties compared with single-walled nanotubes or fullerenes alone, or in their non-bonded configurations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'NanoMaterials Group, Laboratory of Physics and Center for New Materials, Helsinki University of Technology, PO Box 1000, Espoo, 02044, Finland', 'authors': ['Albert G.

letter,Carbon nanotube guided formation of silicon oxide nanotrenches,"<p>The potential applications of carbon nanotubes are varied. Although it has long been known that solid carbon can reduce SiO<sub>2</sub> to its gaseous state at high temperatures, exploiting this reaction to pattern surfaces with carbon nanotubes has never been demonstrated. Here we show that carbon nanotubes can act as the carbon source to reduce (etch) silicon dioxide surfaces. By introducing small amounts of oxygen gas during the growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process, the nanotubes selectively etch one-dimensional nanotrenches in the SiO<sub>2</sub>. The shape, length and trajectory of the nanotrenches are fully guided by the SWNTs. These nanotrenches can also serve as a mask in the fabrication of sub-10-nm metal nanowires. Combined with alignment techniques, well-ordered nanotrenches can be made for various high-density electronic components in the nanoelectronics industry.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), San 31, Hyoja-Dong, Nam-Gu, 790-784, Pohang, Korea', 'authors': ['Hye Ryung Byon', '\xa0&\xa0Hee Cheul Choi']}]",False,"['Hye Ryung Byon', 'Hee Cheul Choi']","Byon, H., Choi, H.

letter,Coerced mechanical coarsening of nanoparticle assemblies,"<p>Coarsening is a ubiquitous phenomenon that underpins countless processes in nature, including epitaxial growth, the phase separation of alloys, polymers and binary fluids, the growth of bubbles in foams, and pattern formation in biomembranes. Here we show, in the first real-time experimental study of the evolution of an adsorbed colloidal nanoparticle array, that tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) can drive the coarsening of Au nanoparticle assemblies on silicon surfaces. Although the growth exponent has a strong dependence on the initial sample morphology, our observations are largely consistent with modified Ostwald ripening processes. To date, ripening processes have been exclusively considered to be thermally activated, but we show that nanoparticle assemblies can be mechanically coerced towards equilibrium, representing a new approach to directed coarsening. This strategy enables precise control over the evolution of micro- and nanostructures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Physics & Astronomy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK', 'authors': ['M.

letter,Quantized magnetoresistance in atomic-size contacts,"<p>When the dimensions of a metallic conductor are reduced so that they become comparable to the de Broglie wavelengths of the conduction electrons, the absence of scattering results in ballistic electron transport and the conductance becomes quantized. In ferromagnetic metals, the spin angular momentum of the electrons results in spin-dependent conductance quantization and various unusual magnetoresistive phenomena. Theorists have predicted a related phenomenon known as ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance (BAMR). Here we report the first experimental evidence for BAMR by observing a stepwise variation in the ballistic conductance of cobalt nanocontacts as the direction of an applied magnetic field is varied. Our results show that BAMR can be positive and negative, and exhibits symmetric and asymmetric angular dependences, consistent with theoretical predictions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, 68588, Nebraska, USA', 'authors': ['Andrei Sokolov', '\xa0&\xa0Evgeny Y.

letter,Tuning the conductance of a molecular switch,"<p>The ability to control the conductance of single molecules will have a major impact in nanoscale electronics. Azobenzene, a molecule that changes conformation as a result of a trans/cis transition when exposed to radiation, could form the basis of a light-driven molecular switch. It is therefore crucial to clarify the electrical transport characteristics of this molecule. Here, we investigate, theoretically, charge transport in a system in which a single azobenzene molecule is attached to two carbon nanotubes. In clear contrast to gold electrodes, the nanotubes can act as true nanoscale electrodes and we show that the low-energy conduction properties of the junction may be dramatically modified by changing the topology of the contacts between the nanotubes and the molecules, and/or the chirality of the nanotubes (that is, zigzag or armchair). We propose experiments to demonstrate controlled electrical switching with nanotube electrodes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, D-93040, Germany', 'authors': ['Miriam del Valle', ',\xa0Rafael Gutiérrez', '\xa0&\xa0Gianaurelio Cuniberti']}, {'address': 'Departamento de Física Teórica de la Materia Condensada, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, E-28049, Spain', 'authors': ['Miriam del Valle', '\xa0&\xa0Carlos Tejedor']}]",False,"['Miriam del Valle', 'Rafael Gutiérrez', 'Carlos Tejedor', 'Gianaurelio Cuniberti']","del Valle, M., Gutiérrez, R., Tejedor, C. et al.

letter,Microcavity effects and optically pumped lasing in single conjugated polymer nanowires,"<p>Conjugated polymers have chemically tuneable opto-electronic properties and are easily processed, making them attractive materials for photonics applications. Conjugated polymer lasers, in a variety of resonator geometries such as microcavity, micro-ring, distributed feedback and photonic bandgap structures, have been fabricated using a range of coating and imprinting techniques. Currently, one-dimensional nanowires are emerging as promising candidates for integrated, subwavelength active and passive photonic devices. We report the first observation of optically pumped lasing in single conjugated polymer nanowires. The waveguide and resonator properties of each wire are characterized in the far optical field at room temperature. The end faces of the nanowire are optically flat and the nanowire acts as a cylindrical optical cavity, exhibiting axial Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot mode structure in the emission spectrum. Above a threshold incident pump energy, the emission spectrum collapses to a single, sharp peak with an instrument-limited line width that is characteristic of single-mode excitonic laser action.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Tyndall National Institute, Lee Maltings, Prospect Row, Cork, Ireland', 'authors': [""Deirdre O'Carroll"", '\xa0&\xa0Gareth Redmond']}, {'address': 'Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Ackermannweg 10, Mainz, D-55128, Germany', 'authors': ['Ingo Lieberwirth']}]",False,"[""Deirdre O'Carroll"", 'Ingo Lieberwirth', 'Gareth Redmond']","O'Carroll, D., Lieberwirth, I. & Redmond, G.

article,Supported lipid bilayer/carbon nanotube hybrids,"<p>Carbon nanotube transistors combine molecular-scale dimensions with excellent electronic properties, offering unique opportunities for chemical and biological sensing. Here, we form supported lipid bilayers over single-walled carbon nanotube transistors. We first study the physical properties of the nanotube/supported lipid bilayer structure using fluorescence techniques. Whereas lipid molecules can diffuse freely across the nanotube, a membrane-bound protein (tetanus toxin) sees the nanotube as a barrier. Moreover, the size of the barrier depends on the diameter of the nanotube&#8212;with larger nanotubes presenting bigger obstacles to diffusion. We then demonstrate detection of protein binding (streptavidin) to the supported lipid bilayer using the nanotube transistor as a charge sensor. This system can be used as a platform to examine the interactions of single molecules with carbon nanotubes and has many potential applications for the study of molecular recognition and other biological processes occurring at cell membranes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory of Atomic and Solid-State Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 14853, USA', 'authors': ['Xinjian Zhou', '\xa0&\xa0Paul L.
