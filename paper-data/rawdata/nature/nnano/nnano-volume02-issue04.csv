review article,Solid-state nanopores,"<p>The passage of individual molecules through nanosized pores in membranes is central to many processes in biology. Previously, experiments have been restricted to naturally occurring nanopores, but advances in technology now allow artificial solid-state nanopores to be fabricated in insulating membranes. By monitoring ion currents and forces as molecules pass through a solid-state nanopore, it is possible to investigate a wide range of phenomena involving DNA, RNA and proteins.

letter,Observation of extremely long spin relaxation times in an organic nanowire spin valve,"<p>Organic semiconductors that are &#960;-conjugated are emerging as an important platform for &#8216;spintronics&#8217;, which purports to harness the spin degree of freedom of a charge carrier to store, process and/or communicate information. Here, we report the study of an organic nanowire spin valve device, 50&#160;nm in diameter, consisting of a trilayer of ferromagnetic cobalt, an organic, Alq<sub>3</sub>, and ferromagnetic nickel. The measured spin relaxation time in the organic is found to be exceptionally long&#8212;between a few milliseconds and a second&#8212;and it is relatively temperature independent up to 100&#160;K. Our experimental observations strongly suggest that the primary spin relaxation mechanism in the organic is the Elliott&#8211;Yafet mode, in which the spin relaxes whenever a carrier scatters and its velocity changes.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

letter,"Native protein nanolithography that can write, read and erase","<p>The development of systematic approaches to explore protein&#8211;protein interactions and dynamic protein networks is at the forefront of biological sciences. Nanopatterned protein arrays offer significant advantages for sensing applications, including short diffusion times, parallel detection of multiple targets and the requirement for only tiny amounts of sample. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques have successfully demonstrated patterning of molecules, including stable proteins, with submicrometre resolution. Here, we introduce native protein nanolithography for the nanostructured assembly of even fragile proteins or multiprotein complexes under native conditions. Immobilized proteins are detached by a novel vibrational AFM mode (contact oscillation mode) and replaced by other proteins, which are selectively self-assembled from the bulk. This nanolithography permits rapid writing, reading and erasing of protein arrays in a versatile manner. Functional protein complexes may be assembled with uniform orientation at dimensions down to 50&#160;nm. Such fabrication of two-dimensionally arranged nano-objects with biological activity will prove powerful for proteome-wide interaction screens and single molecule/virus/cell analyses.</p>",[],False,"[""Ali Tinazli"", ""Jacob Piehler"", ""Mirjam Beuttler"", ""Reinhard Guckenberger"", ""Robert Tamp\u00e9""]","Tinazli, A., Piehler, J., Beuttler, M. et al.

letter,A virus-based biocatalyst,"<p>Virus particles are probably the most precisely defined nanometre-sized objects that can be formed by protein self-assembly. Although their natural function is the storage and transport of genetic material, they have more recently been applied as scaffolds for mineralization and as containers for the encapsulation of inorganic compounds. The reproductive power of viruses has been used to develop versatile analytical methods, such as phage display, for the selection and identification of (bio)active compounds. To date, the combined use of self-assembly and reproduction has not been used for the construction of catalytic systems. Here we describe a self-assembled system based on a plant virus that has its coat protein genetically modified to provide it with a lipase enzyme. Using single-object and bulk catalytic studies, we prove that the virus-anchored lipase molecules are catalytically active. This anchored biocatalyst, unlike man-made supported catalysts, has the capability to reproduce itself in vivo, generating many independent catalytically active copies.</p>",[],False,"[""No\u00eblle Carette"", ""Hans Engelkamp"", ""Eric Akpa"", ""Sebastien J.

article,"High-performance electronics using dense, perfectly aligned arrays of single-walled carbon nanotubes","<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have many exceptional electronic properties. Realizing the full potential of SWNTs in realistic electronic systems requires a scalable approach to device and circuit integration. We report the use of dense, perfectly aligned arrays of long, perfectly linear SWNTs as an effective thin-film semiconductor suitable for integration into transistors and other classes of electronic devices. The large number of SWNTs enable excellent device-level performance characteristics and good device-to-device uniformity, even with SWNTs that are electronically heterogeneous. Measurements on p- and n-channel transistors that involve as many as &#8764;2,100 SWNTs reveal device-level mobilities and scaled transconductances approaching &#8764;1,000 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and &#8764; 3,000 S m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, respectively, and with current outputs of up to &#8764;1 A in devices that use interdigitated electrodes.

article,Chemical modification of the electronic conducting states in polymer nanodevices,"<p>Organic materials offer new electronic functionality not available in inorganic devices. However, the integration of organic compounds within nanoscale electronic circuitry poses new challenges for materials physics and chemistry. Typically, the electronic states in organic materials are energetically misaligned with the Fermi level of metal contacts. Here, we study the voltage-induced change in conductivity in nanoscale devices comprising a monolayer of polyelectrolyte macromolecules. The devices are fabricated using integrated shadow masks. Reversible switching is observed between conducting (ON) and non-conducting (OFF) states in the devices. The open design of our devices easily permits chemical modification of the polyelectrolyte, which we show has a pronounced effect on the ON&#8211;OFF switching. We suggest that the switching voltage ionizes the polymers, creating a conducting channel of electronic levels aligned with the contact Fermi level.</p>",[],False,"[""N. B. Zhitenev"", ""A.

article,Solid-state nanopore channels with DNA selectivity,"<p>Solid-state nanopores have emerged as possible candidates for next-generation DNA sequencing devices. In such a device, the DNA sequence would be determined by measuring how the forces on the DNA molecules, and also the ion currents through the nanopore, change as the molecules pass through the nanopore. Unlike their biological counterparts, solid-state nanopores have the advantage that they can withstand a wide range of analyte solutions and environments. Here we report solid-state nanopore channels that are selective towards single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Nanopores functionalized with a &#8216;probe&#8217; of hair-pin loop DNA can, under an applied electrical field, selectively transport short lengths of &#8216;target&#8217; ssDNA that are complementary to the probe. Even a single base mismatch between the probe and the target results in longer translocation pulses and a significantly reduced number of translocation events. Our single-molecule measurements allow us to measure separately the molecular flux and the pulse duration, providing a tool to gain fundamental insight into the channel&#8211;molecule interactions. The results can be explained in the conceptual framework of diffusive molecular transport with particle&#8211;channel interactions.</p>",[],False,"[""Samir M.

article,Shape effects of filaments versus spherical particles in flow and drug delivery,"<p>Interaction of spherical particles with cells and within animals has been studied extensively, but the effects of shape have received little attention. Here we use highly stable, polymer micelle assemblies known as filomicelles to compare the transport and trafficking of flexible filaments with spheres of similar chemistry. In rodents, filomicelles persisted in the circulation up to one week after intravenous injection. This is about ten times longer than their spherical counterparts and is more persistent than any known synthetic nanoparticle. Under fluid flow conditions, spheres and short filomicelles are taken up by cells more readily than longer filaments because the latter are extended by the flow. Preliminary results further demonstrate that filomicelles can effectively deliver the anticancer drug paclitaxel and shrink human-derived tumours in mice. Although these findings show that long-circulating vehicles need not be nanospheres, they also lend insight into possible shape effects of natural filamentous viruses.</p>",[],False,"[""Yan Geng"", ""Paul Dalhaimer"", ""Shenshen Cai"", ""Richard Tsai"", ""Manorama Tewari"", ""Tamara Minko"", ""Dennis E.
