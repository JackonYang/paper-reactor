review article,DNA nanomachines,"<p>We are learning to build synthetic molecular machinery from DNA. This research is inspired by biological systems in which individual molecules act, singly and in concert, as specialized machines: our ambition is to create new technologies to perform tasks that are currently beyond our reach. DNA nanomachines are made by self-assembly, using techniques that rely on the sequence-specific interactions that bind complementary oligonucleotides together in a double helix. They can be activated by interactions with specific signalling molecules or by changes in their environment. Devices that change state in response to an external trigger might be used for molecular sensing, intelligent drug delivery or programmable chemical synthesis. Biological molecular motors that carry cargoes within cells have inspired the construction of rudimentary DNA walkers that run along self-assembled tracks. It has even proved possible to create DNA motors that move autonomously, obtaining energy by catalysing the reaction of DNA or RNA fuels.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK', 'authors': ['Jonathan Bath', '\xa0&\xa0Andrew J.

letter,Real-time single-molecule imaging of oxidation catalysis at a liquid–solid interface,"<p>Many chemical reactions are catalysed by metal complexes, and insight into their mechanisms is essential for the design of future catalysts. A variety of conventional spectroscopic techniques are available for the study of reaction mechanisms at the ensemble level, and, only recently, fluorescence microscopy techniques have been applied to monitor single chemical reactions carried out on crystal faces and by enzymes. With scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) it has become possible to obtain, during chemical reactions, spatial information at the atomic level. The majority of these STM studies have been carried out under ultrahigh vacuum, far removed from conditions encountered in laboratory processes. Here we report the single-molecule imaging of oxidation catalysis by monitoring, with STM, individual manganese porphyrin catalysts, in real time, at a liquid&#8211;solid interface. It is found that the oxygen atoms from an O<sub>2</sub> molecule are bound to adjacent porphyrin catalysts on the surface before their incorporation into an alkene substrate.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Scanning Probe Microscopy, Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University Nijmegen, Toernooiveld 1, 6525 ED, Nijmegen, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Bas Hulsken', ',\xa0Jan W.

letter,Creation of multiple nanodots by single ions,"<p>In the search to develop tools that are able to modify surfaces on the nanometre scale, the use of heavy ions with energies of several tens of&#160;MeV is becoming more attractive. Low-energy ions are mostly stopped by nuclei, which causes the energy to be dissipated over a large volume. In the high-energy regime, however, the ions are stopped by electronic excitations, and the extremely local (&#8764;10 nm<sup>3</sup>) nature of the energy deposition leads to the creation of nanosized &#8216;hillocks&#8217; or nanodots under normal incidence. Usually, each nanodot results from the impact of a single ion, and the dots are randomly distributed. Here we demonstrate that multiple, equally spaced dots, each separated by a few tens of nanometres, can be created if a single high-energy xenon ion strikes the surface at a grazing angle. By varying this angle, the number of dots, as well as their spacing, can be controlled.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Universität Duisburg-Essen, FB Physik, Duisburg, 47048, Germany', 'authors': ['Ender Akcöltekin', ',\xa0Thorsten Peters', ',\xa0Ralf Meyer', ',\xa0Andreas Duvenbeck', ',\xa0Miriam Klusmann', '\xa0&\xa0Marika Schleberger']}, {'address': 'CIRIL (CEA, CNRS, ENSICAEN), Caen Cedex 5, 14070, France', 'authors': ['Isabelle Monnet', '\xa0&\xa0Henning Lebius']}]",False,"['Ender Akcöltekin', 'Thorsten Peters', 'Ralf Meyer', 'Andreas Duvenbeck', 'Miriam Klusmann', 'Isabelle Monnet', 'Henning Lebius', 'Marika Schleberger']","Akcöltekin, E., Peters, T., Meyer, R. et al.

letter,Mesoporous silica nanoparticles deliver DNA and chemicals into plants,"<p>Surface-functionalized silica nanoparticles can deliver DNA and drugs into animal cells and tissues. However, their use in plants is limited by the cell wall present in plant cells. Here we show a honeycomb mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) system with 3-nm pores that can transport DNA and chemicals into isolated plant cells and intact leaves. We loaded the MSN with the gene and its chemical inducer and capped the ends with gold nanoparticles to keep the molecules from leaching out. Uncapping the gold nanoparticles released the chemicals and triggered gene expression in the plants under controlled-release conditions. Further developments such as pore enlargement and multifunctionalization of these MSNs may offer new possibilities in target-specific delivery of proteins, nucleotides and chemicals in plant biotechnology.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Plant Science Institute and Department of Agronomy, Center for Plant Transformation, Iowa State University, Ames, 50011, Iowa, USA', 'authors': ['François Torney', '\xa0&\xa0Kan Wang']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, US DOE Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames, 50011, Iowa, USA', 'authors': ['Brian G.

article,Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging with 90-nm resolution,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging technique that typically operates on the scale of millimetres to micrometres. Conventional MRI is based on the manipulation of nuclear spins with radio-frequency fields, and the subsequent detection of spins with induction-based techniques. An alternative approach, magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM), uses force detection to overcome the sensitivity limitations of conventional MRI. Here, we show that the two-dimensional imaging of nuclear spins can be extended to a spatial resolution better than 100&#160;nm using MRFM. The imaging of <sup>19</sup>F nuclei in a patterned CaF<sub>2</sub> test object was enabled by a detection sensitivity of roughly 1,200 nuclear spins at a temperature of 600&#160;mK. To achieve this sensitivity, we developed high-moment magnetic tips that produced field gradients up to 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup>&#160;T&#160;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and implemented a measurement protocol based on force-gradient detection of naturally occurring spin fluctuations. The resulting detection volume was less than 650&#160;zeptolitres. This is 60,000 times smaller than the previous smallest volume for nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy, and demonstrates the feasibility of pushing MRI into the nanoscale regime.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Research Division, Almaden Research Center, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, 95120, California, USA', 'authors': ['H.

article,In situ nucleation of carbon nanotubes by the injection of carbon atoms into metal particles,"<p>The synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of desired chiralities and diameters is one of the most important challenges in nanotube science and achieving such selectivity may require a detailed understanding of their growth mechanism. We report the formation of CNTs in an entirely condensed phase process that allows us, for the first time, to monitor the nucleation of a nanotube on the spherical surface of a metal particle. When multiwalled CNTs containing metal particle cores are irradiated with an electron beam, carbon from graphitic shells surrounding the metal particles is ingested into the body of the particle and subsequently emerges as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs) inside the host nanotubes. These observations, at atomic resolution in an electron microscope, show that there is direct bonding between the tubes and the metal surface from which the tubes sprout and can be readily explained by bulk diffusion of carbon through the body of catalytic particles, with no evidence of surface diffusion.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Advanced Materials Department, IPICyT, Camino a la Presa San José 2055, Col.

article,Spin qubits with electrically gated polyoxometalate molecules,"<p>Spin qubits offer one of the most promising routes to the implementation of quantum computers. Very recent results in semiconductor quantum dots show that electrically-controlled gating schemes are particularly well-suited for the realization of a universal set of quantum logical gates. Scalability to a larger number of qubits, however, remains an issue for such semiconductor quantum dots. In contrast, a chemical bottom-up approach allows one to produce identical units in which localized spins represent the qubits. Molecular magnetism has produced a wide range of systems with properties that can be tailored, but so far, there have been no molecules in which the spin state can be controlled by an electrical gate. Here we propose to use the polyoxometalate [PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>(VO)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>q&#8722;</sup>, where two localized spins with S&#160;=&#160;1/2 can be coupled through the electrons of the central core.
