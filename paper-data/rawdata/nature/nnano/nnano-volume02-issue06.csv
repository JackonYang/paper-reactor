progress article,Biomimetics of photonic nanostructures,"<p>Biomimetics is the extraction of good design from nature. One approach to optical biomimetics focuses on the use of conventional engineering methods to make direct analogues of the reflectors and anti-reflectors found in nature. However, recent collaborations between biologists, physicists, engineers, chemists and materials scientists have ventured beyond experiments that merely mimic what happens in nature, leading to a thriving new area of research involving biomimetics through cell culture. In this new approach, the nanoengineering efficiency of living cells is harnessed and natural organisms such as diatoms and viruses are used to make nanostructures that could have commercial applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Andrew R.

letter,"Growth and alignment of polyaniline nanofibres with superhydrophobic, superhydrophilic and other properties","<p>Polyaniline nanofibres can be prepared by a number of methods based on chemical oxidative polymerization and in situ adsorption polymerization. However, the lack of alignment in these nanostructures makes them unsuitable for many applications. Here, we report a simple approach to chemical oxidative polymerization that can control the growth and simultaneous alignment of polyaniline nanofibres grown on a range of conducting and non-conducting substrates in a wide variety of sizes. The diameters of the tips of the nanofibres can be controlled within the range 10&#8211;40&#160;nm, and the average length can be controlled within the range 70&#8211;360&#160;nm. Moreover, the coatings display a range of properties including superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity. Such nanostructured coatings may be useful for applications such as anti-fog coatings, self-cleaning surfaces, DNA manipulation, transparent electrodes for low-voltage electronics, and chemical and biological sensors.</p>",[],False,"[""Nan-Rong Chiou"", ""Chunmeng Lu"", ""Jingjiao Guan"", ""L.

letter,Imaging active topological defects in carbon nanotubes,"<p>A single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) is a wrapped single graphene layer, and its plastic deformation should require active topological defects&#8212;non-hexagonal carbon rings that can migrate along the nanotube wall. Although in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to examine the deformation of SWNTs, these studies deal only with diameter changes and no atomistic mechanism has been elucidated experimentally. Theory predicts that some topological defects can form through the Stone&#8211;Wales transformation in SWNTs under tension at 2,000&#160;K, and could act as a dislocation core. We demonstrate here, by means of high-resolution (HR)-TEM with atomic sensitivity, the first direct imaging of pentagon&#8211;heptagon pair defects found in an SWNT that was heated at 2,273&#160;K. Moreover, our in situ HR-TEM observation reveals an accumulation of topological defects near the kink of a deformed nanotube. This result suggests that dislocation motions or active topological defects are indeed responsible for the plastic deformation of SWNTs.</p>",[],False,"[""Kazu Suenaga"", ""Hideaki Wakabayashi"", ""Masanori Koshino"", ""Yuta Sato"", ""Koki Urita"", ""Sumio Iijima""]","Suenaga, K., Wakabayashi, H., Koshino, M. et al.

letter,Optically active single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>The optical, electrical and mechanical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are largely determined by their structures, and bulk availability of uniform materials is vital for extending their technological applications. Since they were first prepared, much effort has been directed toward selective synthesis and separation of SWNTs with specific structures. As-prepared samples of chiral SWNTs contain equal amounts of left- and right-handed helical structures, but little attention has been paid to the separation of these non-superimposable mirror image forms, known as optical isomers. Here, we show that optically active SWNT samples can be obtained by preferentially extracting either right- or left-handed SWNTs from a commercial sample. Chiral &#8216;gable-type&#8217; diporphyrin molecules bind with different affinities to the left- and right-handed helical nanotube isomers to form complexes with unequal stabilities that can be readily separated. Significantly, the diporphyrins can be liberated from the complexes afterwards, to provide optically enriched SWNTs.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaobin Peng"", ""Naoki Komatsu"", ""Sumanta Bhattacharya"", ""Takanori Shimawaki"", ""Shuji Aonuma"", ""Takahide Kimura"", ""Atsuhiro Osuka""]","Peng, X., Komatsu, N., Bhattacharya, S. et al.

letter,Tunable non-equilibrium gating of flexible DNA nanochannels in response to transport flux,"<p>Biological nanochannels made from proteins play a central role in cellular signalling. The rapid emergence of DNA nanotechnology in recent years has opened up the possibility of making similar nanochannels from DNA. Building on previous work on switchable DNA nanocompartment, we have constructed complex DNA nanosystems to investigate the gating behaviour of these nanochannels. Here we show that DNA nanochannels can be gated by stress exerted by permeating solute particles at non-equilibrium states due to the high flexibility of the nanochannels. This novel gating mechanism results in tunable ratchet-like transport of solute particles through the nanochannels. A simple model that couples non-equilibrium channel gating with transport flux can quantitatively explain a number of the phenomena we observe. With only one set of model parameters, we can reproduce diverse gating behaviours, modulated by an inherent gating threshold. This work could lead to the development of new devices based on DNA nanochannels.</p>",[],False,"[""Youdong Mao"", ""Song Chang"", ""Shaoxuan Yang"", ""Qi Ouyang"", ""Lei Jiang""]","Mao, Y., Chang, S., Yang, S. et al.

article,Large-area blown bubble films of aligned nanowires and carbon nanotubes,"<p>Many of the applications proposed for nanowires and carbon nanotubes require these components to be organized over large areas with controlled orientation and density. Although progress has been made with directed assembly and Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett approaches, it is unclear whether these techniques can be scaled to large wafers and non-rigid substrates. Here, we describe a general and scalable approach for large-area, uniformly aligned and controlled-density nanowire and nanotube films, which involves expanding a bubble from a homogeneous suspension of these materials. The blown-bubble films were transferred to single-crystal wafers of at least 200&#160;mm in diameter, flexible plastics sheets of dimensions of at least 225&#160;&#215;&#160;300&#160;mm<sup>2</sup> and highly curved surfaces, and were also suspended across open frames. In addition, electrical measurements show that large arrays of nanowire field-effect transistors can be efficiently fabricated on the wafer scale. Given the potential of blown film extrusion to produce continuous films with widths exceeding 1&#160;m, we believe that our approach could allow the unique properties of nanowires and nanotubes to be exploited in applications requiring large areas and relatively modest device densities.</p>",[],False,"[""Guihua Yu"", ""Anyuan Cao"", ""Charles M.

Nanowire transistors (NWTs) are of particular interest for future display devices because of their high carrier mobilities compared with bulk or thin-film transistors made from the same materials, the prospect of processing at low temperatures compatible with plastic substrates, as well as their optical transparency and inherent mechanical flexibility. Here we report fully transparent In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and ZnO NWTs fabricated on both glass and flexible plastic substrates, exhibiting high-performance n-type transistor characteristics with &#8764;82% optical transparency. These NWTs should be attractive as pixel-switching and driving transistors in active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays. The transparency of the entire pixel area should significantly enhance aperture ratio efficiency in active-matrix arrays and thus substantially decrease power consumption.</p>",[],False,"[""Sanghyun Ju"", ""Antonio Facchetti"", ""Yi Xuan"", ""Jun Liu"", ""Fumiaki Ishikawa"", ""Peide Ye"", ""Chongwu Zhou"", ""Tobin J.
