review article,Molecular logic and computing,"<p>Molecular substrates can be viewed as computational devices that process physical or chemical 'inputs' to generate 'outputs' based on a set of logical operators. By recognizing this conceptual crossover between chemistry and computation, it can be argued that the success of life itself is founded on a much longer-term revolution in information handling when compared with the modern semiconductor computing industry. Many of the simpler logic operations can be identified within chemical reactions and phenomena, as well as being produced in specifically designed systems. Some degree of integration can also be arranged, leading, in some instances, to arithmetic processing. These molecular logic systems can also lend themselves to convenient reconfiguring. Their clearest application area is in the life sciences, where their small size is a distinct advantage over conventional semiconductor counterparts. Molecular logic designs aid chemical (especially intracellular) sensing, small object recognition and intelligent diagnostics.</p>",,"[{'address': ""School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University, Belfast, BT9 5AG, Northern Ireland"", 'authors': ['A.

letter,Electromechanical response of single-walled carbon nanotubes to torsional strain in a self-contained device,"<p>Nanoscale electronics seeks to decrease the critical dimension of devices in order to improve performance while reducing power consumption. Single-walled carbon nanotubes fit well with this strategy because, in addition to their molecular size, they demonstrate a number of unique electronic, mechanical and electromechanical properties. In particular, theory predicts that strain can have a large effect on the band structure of a nanotube, which, in turn, has an influence on its electron transport properties. This has been demonstrated in experiments where axial strain was applied by a scanning probe. Theory also predicts that torsional strain can influence transport properties, which was observed recently in multiwalled nanotubes. Here we present the first experimental evidence of an electromechanical effect from torsional strain in single-walled nanotubes, and also the first measurements of piezoresistive response in a self-contained nanotube-based nanoelectromechanical structure.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Curriculum in Applied and Materials Sciences', 'authors': ['Adam R.

letter,Fatigue resistance of aligned carbon nanotube arrays under cyclic compression,"<p>Structural components subject to cyclic stress can succumb to fatigue, causing them to fail at stress levels much lower than if they were under static mechanical loading. However, despite extensive research into the mechanical properties of carbon nanotube structures for more than a decade, data on the fatigue behaviour of such devices have never been reported. We show that under repeated high compressive strains, long, vertically aligned multiwalled nanotubes exhibit viscoelastic behaviour similar to that observed in soft-tissue membranes. Under compressive cyclic loading, the mechanical response of the nanotube arrays shows preconditioning, characteristic viscoelasticity-induced hysteresis, nonlinear elasticity and stress relaxation, and large deformations. Furthermore, no fatigue failure is observed at high strain amplitudes up to half a million cycles. This combination of soft-tissue-like behaviour and outstanding fatigue resistance suggests that properly engineered nanotube structures could mimic artificial tissues, and that their good electrical conductivity could lead to their use as compliant electrical contacts in a variety of applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Nevada, Nevada, 89557, Reno, USA', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Imaging the dynamic behaviour of individual retinal chromophores confined inside carbon nanotubes,"<p>Retinal is the molecule found in photoreceptor cells that undergoes a change in shape when it absorbs light. Specifically, the cis/trans isomerization of a carbon&#8211;carbon double bond in this chromophore sets in motion the chain of biochemical processes responsible for vision. Here, we obtain atomically resolved images of individual structural isomers of the retinal chromophore attached to C<sub>60</sub> molecules and study their dynamic behaviour inside a confined space&#8212;that is, inside single-walled carbon nanotubes&#8212;using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Sequential HR-TEM images with sub-second time resolution directly reveal the isomerization between the cis and all-trans forms of retinal, as well as conformational changes and volume-conserving effects. This work opens up the possibility of investigating in vitro the biological activities of these photoresponsive molecules on an individual basis, and the molecular imaging technique described here is a general one that can be applied to a wide range of systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Center for Advanced Carbon Materials, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, 305-8565, Japan', 'authors': ['Zheng Liu', ',\xa0Kazu Suenaga', '\xa0&\xa0Sumio Iijima']}, {'address': 'Nanotechnology Research Institute (NRI), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, 305-8562, Japan', 'authors': ['Kazuhiro Yanagi', '\xa0&\xa0Hiromichi Kataura']}]",False,"['Zheng Liu', 'Kazuhiro Yanagi', 'Kazu Suenaga', 'Hiromichi Kataura', 'Sumio Iijima']","Liu, Z., Yanagi, K., Suenaga, K. et al.

letter,Surface plasmon polariton analogue to Young's double-slit experiment,"<p>When a light wave strikes a metal film it can, under appropriate conditions, excite a surface plasmon polariton (SPP)&#8212;a surface electromagnetic wave that is coupled to the free electrons in the metal. Such SPPs are involved in a wide range of phenomena, including nanoscale optical waveguiding, perfect lensing, extraordinary optical transmission, subwavelength lithography and ultrahigh-sensitivity biosensing. However, before the full potential of technology based on SPPs (termed &#8216;plasmonics&#8217;) can be realized, many fundamental questions regarding the interaction between light and matter at the nanoscale need to be answered. For over 200 years, Young's double-slit experiment has been a valuable pedagogical tool for demonstrating the wave nature of light. Here, we perform a double-slit experiment with SPPs to reveal the strong analogy between SPP propagation along the surface of metallic structures and light propagation in conventional dielectric components (such as glass waveguides). This allows us to construct a general framework to describe the propagation, diffraction and interference of SPPs. It also suggests that there is an effective diffraction limit for the lateral confinement of SPPs on metal stripe waveguides, and justifies the use of well-developed concepts from conventional optics and photonics in the design of new plasmonic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Rashid Zia', '\xa0&\xa0Mark L.

letter,A dielectric-modulated field-effect transistor for biosensing,"<p>Interest in biosensors based on field-effect transistors (FETs), where an electrically operated gate controls the flow of charge through a semiconducting channel, is driven by the prospect of integrating biodetection capabilities into existing semiconductor technology. In a number of proposed FET biosensors, surface interactions with biomolecules in solution affect the operation of the gate or the channel. However, these devices often have limited sensitivity. We show here that a FET biosensor with a vertical gap is sensitive to the specific binding of streptavidin to biotin. The binding of the streptavidin changes the dielectric constant (and capacitance) of the gate, resulting in a large shift in the threshold voltage for operating the FET. The vertical gap is fabricated using simple thin-film deposition and wet-etching techniques. This may be an advantage over planar nanogap FETs, which require lithographic processing. We believe that the dielectric-modulated FET (DMFET) provides a useful approach towards biomolecular detection that could be extended to a number of other systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nano-Oriented Bio-Electronic Lab, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305-701, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Hyungsoon Im', ',\xa0Xing-Jiu Huang', ',\xa0Bonsang Gu', '\xa0&\xa0Yang-Kyu Choi']}]",True,"['Hyungsoon Im', 'Xing-Jiu Huang', 'Bonsang Gu', 'Yang-Kyu Choi']","Im, H., Huang, X., Gu, B. et al.A dielectric-modulated field-effect transistor for biosensing.

article,Tunable plasmonic lattices of silver nanocrystals,"<p>Silver nanocrystals are ideal building blocks for plasmonic materials that exhibit a wide range of unique and potentially useful optical phenomena. Individual nanocrystals display distinct optical scattering spectra and can be assembled into hierarchical structures that couple strongly to external electromagnetic fields. This coupling, which is mediated by surface plasmons, depends on the shape and arrangement of the nanocrystals. Here we demonstrate the bottom-up assembly of polyhedral silver nanocrystals into macroscopic two-dimensional superlattices using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett technique. Our ability to control interparticle spacing, density and packing symmetry allows for tunability of the optical response over the entire visible range. This assembly strategy offers a new, practical approach to making novel plasmonic materials for application in spectroscopic sensors, subwavelength optics and integrated devices that utilize field-enhancement effects.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Andrea Tao', ',\xa0Prasert Sinsermsuksakul', '\xa0&\xa0Peidong Yang']}, {'address': 'Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Andrea Tao', '\xa0&\xa0Peidong Yang']}]",False,"['Andrea Tao', 'Prasert Sinsermsuksakul', 'Peidong Yang']","Tao, A., Sinsermsuksakul, P. & Yang, P.

article,Bacteria-mediated delivery of nanoparticles and cargo into cells,"<p>Nanoparticles and bacteria can be used, independently, to deliver genes and proteins into mammalian cells for monitoring or altering gene expression and protein production. Here, we show the simultaneous use of nanoparticles and bacteria to deliver DNA-based model drug molecules in vivo and in vitro. In our approach, cargo (in this case, a fluorescent or a bioluminescent gene) is loaded onto the nanoparticles, which are carried on the bacteria surface. When incubated with cells, the cargo-carrying bacteria (&#8216;microbots&#8217;) were internalized by the cells, and the genes released from the nanoparticles were expressed in the cells. Mice injected with microbots also successfully expressed the genes as seen by the luminescence in different organs.
