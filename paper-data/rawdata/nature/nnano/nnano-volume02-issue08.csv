review article,Immunological properties of engineered nanomaterials,"<p>Most research on the toxicology of nanomaterials has focused on the effects of nanoparticles that enter the body accidentally. There has been much less research on the toxicology of nanoparticles that are used for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery or imaging, in which the nanoparticles are deliberately placed in the body. Moreover, there are no harmonized standards for assessing the toxicity of nanoparticles to the immune system (immunotoxicity). Here we review recent research on immunotoxicity, along with data on a range of nanotechnology-based drugs that are at different stages in the approval process. Research shows that nanoparticles can stimulate and/or suppress the immune responses, and that their compatibility with the immune system is largely determined by their surface chemistry. Modifying these factors can significantly reduce the immunotoxicity of nanoparticles and make them useful platforms for drug delivery.</p>",[],False,"[""Marina A. Dobrovolskaia"", ""Scott E.

letter,Alternating current Josephson effect and resonant superconducting transport through vibrating Nb nanowires,"<p>In 1962, Josephson made a celebrated prediction: when a constant voltage is applied across a thin insulator separating two superconductors, it will generate an oscillating current. These oscillations are ubiquitous in superconducting weak links of various geometries, and analogues have been found in other macroscopic quantum systems, such as superfluids and gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates. The interplay between the oscillating current and external microwave radiation of matching frequency (Shapiro steps) or with internal electrodynamic resonances (Fiske effect) appear as changes in the current&#8211;voltage characteristics of superconducting tunnel junctions and provide further insight into the phenomenon. Here, we report measurements and theoretical studies suggesting that Josephson current oscillations interact with atomic-scale mechanical motion as well. We formed a niobium dimer nanowire that acts as a weak link between two superconducting (bulk) niobium electrodes. We find features in the differential conductance through the dimer which we believe correspond to excitations of the dimer vibrational modes by Josephson oscillations and support our results with theoretical simulations.</p>",[],False,"[""Alexei Marchenkov"", ""Zhenting Dai"", ""Brandon Donehoo"", ""Robert N.

letter,Evaporation and deposition of alkyl-capped silicon nanocrystals in ultrahigh vacuum,"<p>Nanocrystals are under active investigation because of their interesting size-dependent properties and potential applications. Silicon nanocrystals have been studied for possible uses in optoelectronics, and may be relevant to the understanding of natural processes such as lightning strikes. Gas-phase methods can be used to prepare nanocrystals, and mass spectrometric techniques have been used to analyse Au and CdSe clusters. However, it is difficult to study nanocrystals by such methods unless they are synthesized in the gas phase. In particular, pre-prepared nanocrystals are generally difficult to sublime without decomposition. Here we report the observation that films of alkyl-capped silicon nanocrystals evaporate upon heating in ultrahigh vacuum at 200&#160;&#176;C, and the vapour of intact nanocrystals can be collected on a variety of solid substrates. This effect may be useful for the controlled preparation of new quantum-confined silicon structures and could facilitate their mass spectroscopic study and size-selection.</p>",[],False,"[""Yimin Chao"", ""Lidija \u0160iller"", ""Satheesh Krishnamurthy"", ""Paul R.

letter,Targeted delivery of magnetic aerosol droplets to the lung,"<p>The inhalation of medical aerosols is widely used for the treatment of lung disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, respiratory infection and, more recently, lung cancer. Targeted aerosol delivery to the affected lung tissue may improve therapeutic efficiency and minimize unwanted side effects. Despite enormous progress in optimizing aerosol delivery to the lung, targeted aerosol delivery to specific lung regions other than the airways or the lung periphery has not been adequately achieved to date. Here, we show theoretically by computer-aided simulation, and for the first time experimentally in mice, that targeted aerosol delivery to the lung can be achieved with aerosol droplets comprising superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles&#8212;so-called nanomagnetosols&#8212;in combination with a target-directed magnetic gradient field. We suggest that nanomagnetosols may be useful for treating localized lung disease, by targeting foci of bacterial infection or tumour nodules.</p>",[],False,"[""Petra Dames"", ""Bernhard Gleich"", ""Andreas Flemmer"", ""Kerstin Hajek"", ""Nicole Seidl"", ""Frank Wiekhorst"", ""Dietmar Eberbeck"", ""Iris Bittmann"", ""Christian Bergemann"", ""Thomas Weyh"", ""Lutz Trahms"", ""Joseph Rosenecker"", ""Carsten Rudolph""]","Dames, P., Gleich, B., Flemmer, A. et al.

article,Assembly of aligned linear metallic patterns on silicon,"<p>In order to harness the potential of block copolymers to produce nanoscale structures that can be integrated with existing silicon-based technologies, there is a need for compatible chemistries. Block copolymer nanostructures can form a wide variety of two-dimensional patterns, and can be controlled to present long-range order. Here we use the acid-responsive nature of self-assembled monolayers of aligned, horizontal block copolymer cylinders for metal loading with simple aqueous solutions of anionic metal complexes, followed by brief plasma treatment to simultaneously remove the block copolymer and produce metallic nanostructures. Aligned lines of metal with widths on the order of 10&#160;nm and less are efficiently produced by means of this approach on Si(100) interfaces. The method is highly versatile because the chemistry to manipulate nanowire composition, structure and choice of semiconductor is under the control of the user.</p>",[],False,"[""Jinan Chai"", ""Dong Wang"", ""Xiangning Fan"", ""Jillian M.

article,An atomic force microscope tip designed to measure time-varying nanomechanical forces,"<p>Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), in which the vibrating tip periodically approaches, interacts and retracts from the sample surface, is the most common AFM imaging method. The tip experiences attractive and repulsive forces that depend on the chemical and mechanical properties of the sample, yet conventional AFM tips are limited in their ability to resolve these time-varying forces. We have created a specially designed cantilever tip that allows these interaction forces to be measured with good (sub-microsecond) temporal resolution and material properties to be determined and mapped in detail with nanoscale spatial resolution. Mechanical measurements based on these force waveforms are provided at a rate of 4&#160;kHz. The forces and contact areas encountered in these measurements are orders of magnitude smaller than conventional indentation and AFM-based indentation techniques that typically provide data rates around 1&#160;Hz. We use this tool to quantify and map nanomechanical changes in a binary polymer blend in the vicinity of its glass transition.</p>",[],False,"[""Ozgur Sahin"", ""Sergei Magonov"", ""Chanmin Su"", ""Calvin F.

article,Enhanced fluorescence emission from quantum dots on a photonic crystal surface,"<p>Colloidal quantum dots display a wide range of novel optical properties that could prove useful for many applications in photonics. Here, we report the enhancement of fluorescence emission from colloidal quantum dots on the surface of two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs. The enhancement is due to a combination of high-intensity near fields and strong coherent scattering effects, which we attribute to leaky eigenmodes of the photonic crystal. By fabricating two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs that operate at visible wavelengths and engineering their leaky modes so that they overlap with the absorption and emission wavelengths of the quantum dots, we demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity can be enhanced by a factor of up to 108 compared with quantum dots on an unpatterned surface.</p>",[],False,"[""Nikhil Ganesh"", ""Wei Zhang"", ""Patrick C.
