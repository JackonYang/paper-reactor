letter,Synergetic nanowire growth,"<p>Interest in nanowires continues to grow because they hold the promise of monolithic integration of high-performance semiconductors with new functionality into existing silicon technology. Most nanowires are grown using vapour&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid growth, and despite many years of study this growth mechanism remains under lively debate. In particular, the role of the metal particle is unclear. For instance, contradictory results have been reported on the effect of particle size on nanowire growth rate. Additionally, nanowire growth from a patterned array of catalysts has shown that small wire-to-wire spacing leads to materials competition and a reduction in growth rates. Here, we report on a counterintuitive synergetic effect resulting in an increase of the growth rate for decreasing wire-to-wire distance. We show that the growth rate is proportional to the catalyst area fraction. The effect has its origin in the catalytic decomposition of precursors and is applicable to a variety of nanowire materials and growth techniques.</p>",[],False,"[""Magnus T.

letter,Self-formation of sub-60-nm half-pitch gratings with large areas through fracturing,"<p>Periodic micro- and nanostructures (gratings) have many significant applications in electronic, optical, magnetic, chemical and biological devices and materials. Traditional methods for fabricating gratings by writing with electrons, ions or a mechanical tip are limited to very small areas and suffer from extremely low throughput. Interference lithography can achieve relatively large fabrication areas, but has a low yield for small-period gratings. Photolithography, nanoimprint lithography, soft lithography and lithographically induced self-construction all require a prefabricated mask, and although electrohydrodynamic instabilities can self-produce periodic dots without a mask, gratings remain challenging. Here, we report a new low-cost maskless method to self-generate nano- and microgratings from an initially featureless polymer thin film sandwiched between two relatively rigid flat plates. By simply prising apart the plates, the film fractures into two complementary sets of nonsymmetrical gratings, one on each plate, of the same period. The grating period is always four times the thickness of the glassy film, regardless of its molecular weight and chemical composition. Periods from 120&#160;nm to 200&#160;&#181;m have been demonstrated across areas as large as two square centimetres.</p>",[],False,"[""Leonard F.

letter,Multiscale patterning of plasmonic metamaterials,"<p>The interaction of light with surface plasmons&#8212;collective oscillations of free electrons&#8212;in metallic nanostructures has resulted in demonstrations of enhanced optical transmission, collimation of light through a subwavelength aperture, negative permeability and refraction at visible wavelengths, and second-harmonic generation from magnetic metamaterials. The structures that display these plasmonic phenomena typically consist of ordered arrays of particles or holes with sizes of the order of 100&#160;nm. However, surface plasmons can interact with each other over much longer distances, so the ability to organize nanoscale particles or holes over multiple length scales could lead to new plasmonic metamaterials with novel optical properties. Here, we present a high-throughput nanofabrication technique&#8212;soft interference lithography&#8212;that combines the ability of interference lithography to produce wafer-scale nanopatterns with the versatility of soft lithography, and use it to create such plasmonic metamaterials. Metal films perforated with quasi-infinite arrays of 100-nm holes were generated over areas greater than 10&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>, exhibiting sharp spectral features that changed in relative amplitude and shifted to longer wavelengths when exposed to increased refractive index environments. Moreover, gold nanohole arrays patterned into microscale patches exhibited strikingly different transmission properties; for instance, patches of nanoholes displayed narrow resonances (&lt;14.5&#160;nm full-width-at-half-maximum) that resulted in high refractive index sensitivities far exceeding those reported previously. Soft interference lithography was also used to produce various infinite and finite-area arrays of nanoparticles, including patterns that contained optically distinct particles side by side and arrays that contained both metallic and dielectric materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Joel Henzie"", ""Min Hyung Lee"", ""Teri W.

letter,Highly efficient resonant coupling of optical excitations in hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor nanostructures,"<p>The integration of organic and inorganic semiconductors on the nanoscale offers the possibility of developing new photonic devices that combine the best features of these two distinct classes of material. Such devices could, for example, benefit from the large oscillator strengths found in organic materials and the nonlinear optical properties of inorganic species. Here we describe a novel hybrid organic/inorganic nanocomposite in which alternating monolayers of J-aggregates of cyanine dye and crystalline semiconductor quantum dots are grown by a layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. We demonstrate near-field photon-mediated coupling of vastly dissimilar optical excitations in the two materials that can reach efficiencies of up to 98% at room temperature. By varying the size of the quantum dots and thus tuning their optical resonance for absorption and emission, we also show how the ability of J-aggregates to harvest light can be harnessed to increase the effective absorption cross section of the quantum dots by up to a factor of ten. Combining organic and inorganic semiconductors in this way could lead to novel nanoscale designs for light-emitting, photovoltaic and sensor applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Qiang Zhang"", ""Tolga Atay"", ""Jonathan R.

letter,Reversible fluorescence quenching in carbon nanotubes for biomolecular sensing,"<p>Biosensing applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated in solid-state device structures. Bioanalyte sensing schemes based on coupling of reversible nanotube fluorescence quenching to redox reactions paired to enzymatic peroxide generation have also been pursued. Here we show a new approach to highly sensitive nanotube-based optical sensing. Single-walled carbon nanotubes interacting with dye&#8211;ligand conjugates&#8212;a redox-active dye molecule that is covalently bound to a biological receptor ligand (such as biotin in this case)&#8212;showed fluorescence quenching. Further interaction between the receptor ligand on the conjugates and target analytes (avidin in this case) induced the recovery of the quenched fluorescence, forming the basis of the sensing scheme. Nanomolar sensitivity was attained with high specificity for the target analyte. This is a versatile approach because a wide range of conjugation possibilities exists between the potential receptors and redox quenchers.</p>",[],False,"[""B. C. Satishkumar"", ""Leif O.

article,Hinged nanorods made using a chemical approach to flexible nanostructures,"<p>The fabrication of multifunctional nanomaterials and their subsequent use for novel applications in various branches of nanotechnology has been under intense scrutiny. Particularly in the area of nanomechanics, the design of multicomponent nanostructures with an integrated multifunctionality would enable the construction of building blocks for nanoscale analogues of macroscopic objects. Here, we introduce a new class of flexible nanostructures: metallic nanorods with polyelectrolyte hinges, synthesized using layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes on barcode metal nanorods followed by segment-selective chemical etching. Nanorods with hinges that consist of one polyelectrolyte bilayer display considerable flexibility, but with a greater number of bilayers the flexibility of the hinge is significantly reduced. Magnetically induced bending about the polymer hinge is illustrated through the incorporation of nickel segments into the barcodes and the application of an external fluctuating magnetic field.</p>",[],False,"[""Tihana Mirkovic"", ""Maw Lin Foo"", ""Andr\u00e9 C.

article,Nanoparticle printing with single-particle resolution,"<p>Bulk syntheses of colloids efficiently produce nanoparticles with unique and useful properties. Their integration onto surfaces is a prerequisite for exploiting these properties in practice. Ideally, the integration would be compatible with a variety of surfaces and particles, while also enabling the fabrication of large areas and arbitrarily high-accuracy patterns. Whereas printing routinely meets these demands at larger length scales, we have developed a novel printing process that enables positioning of sub-100-nm particles individually with high placement accuracy. A colloidal suspension is inked directly onto printing plates, whose wetting properties and geometry ensure that the nanoparticles only fill predefined topographical features. The dry particle assembly is subsequently printed from the plate onto plain substrates through tailored adhesion. We demonstrate that the process can create a variety of particle arrangements including lines, arrays and bitmaps, while preserving the catalytic and optical activity of the individual nanoparticles.</p>",[],False,"[""Tobias Kraus"", ""Laurent Malaquin"", ""Heinz Schmid"", ""Walter Riess"", ""Nicholas D.

article,Intrinsic peroxidase-like activity of ferromagnetic nanoparticles,"<p>Nanoparticles containing magnetic materials, such as magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), are particularly useful for imaging and separation techniques. As these nanoparticles are generally considered to be biologically and chemically inert, they are typically coated with metal catalysts, antibodies or enzymes to increase their functionality as separation agents. Here, we report that magnetite nanoparticles in fact possess an intrinsic enzyme mimetic activity similar to that found in natural peroxidases, which are widely used to oxidize organic substrates in the treatment of wastewater or as detection tools. Based on this finding, we have developed a novel immunoassay in which antibody-modified magnetite nanoparticles provide three functions: capture, separation and detection. The stability, ease of production and versatility of these nanoparticles makes them a powerful tool for a wide range of potential applications in medicine, biotechnology and environmental chemistry.</p>",[],False,"[""Lizeng Gao"", ""Jie Zhuang"", ""Leng Nie"", ""Jinbin Zhang"", ""Yu Zhang"", ""Ning Gu"", ""Taihong Wang"", ""Jing Feng"", ""Dongling Yang"", ""Sarah Perrett"", ""Xiyun Yan""]","Gao, L., Zhuang, J., Nie, L. et al.
