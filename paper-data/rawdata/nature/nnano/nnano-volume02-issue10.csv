review article,Carbon-based electronics,"<p>The semiconductor industry has been able to improve the performance of electronic systems for more than four decades by making ever-smaller devices. However, this approach will soon encounter both scientific and technical limits, which is why the industry is exploring a number of alternative device technologies. Here we review the progress that has been made with carbon nanotubes and, more recently, graphene layers and nanoribbons. Field-effect transistors based on semiconductor nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons have already been demonstrated, and metallic nanotubes could be used as high-performance interconnects. Moreover, owing to the excellent optical properties of nanotubes it could be possible to make both electronic and optoelectronic devices from the same material.</p>",[],False,"[""Phaedon Avouris"", ""Zhihong Chen"", ""Vasili Perebeinos""]","Avouris, P., Chen, Z. & Perebeinos, V.

letter,Nanopatterning the electronic properties of gold surfaces with self-organized superlattices of metallic nanostructures,"<p>The self-organized growth of nanostructures on surfaces could offer many advantages in the development of new catalysts, electronic devices and magnetic data-storage media. The local density of electronic states on the surface at the relevant energy scale strongly influences chemical reactivity, as does the shape of the nanoparticles. The electronic properties of surfaces also influence the growth and decay of nanostructures such as dimers, chains and superlattices of atoms or noble metal islands. Controlling these properties on length scales shorter than the diffusion lengths of the electrons and spins (some tens of nanometres for metals) is a major goal in electronics and spintronics. However, to date, there have been few studies of the electronic properties of self-organized nanostructures. Here we report the self-organized growth of macroscopic superlattices of Ag or Cu nanostructures on Au vicinal surfaces, and demonstrate that the electronic properties of these systems depend on the balance between the confinement and the perturbation of the surface states caused by the steps and the nanostructures' superlattice. We also show that the local density of states can be modified in a controlled way by adjusting simple parameters such as the type of metal deposited and the degree of coverage.</p>",[],False,"[""Clement Didiot"", ""Stephane Pons"", ""Bertrand Kierren"", ""Yannick Fagot-Revurat"", ""Daniel Malterre""]","Didiot, C., Pons, S., Kierren, B. et al.

letter,A Ge/Si heterostructure nanowire-based double quantum dot with integrated charge sensor,"<p>One proposal for a solid-state-based quantum bit (qubit) is to control coupled electron spins on adjacent semiconductor quantum dots. Most experiments have focused on quantum dots made from III&#8211;V semiconductors; however, the coherence of electron spins in these materials is limited by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins. Ge/Si core/shell nanowires seem ideally suited to overcome this limitation, because the most abundant nuclei in Ge and Si have spin zero and the nanowires can be chemically synthesized defect-free with tunable properties. Here, we present a double quantum dot based on Ge/Si nanowires in which we can completely control the coupling between the dots and to the leads. We also demonstrate that charge on the double dot can be detected by coupling it capacitively to an adjacent nanowire quantum dot. The double quantum dot and integrated charge sensor serve as an essential building block to form a solid-state qubit free of nuclear spin.</p>",[],False,"[""Yongjie Hu"", ""Hugh O. H.

letter,Highly scalable non-volatile and ultra-low-power phase-change nanowire memory,"<p>The search for a universal memory storage device that combines rapid read and write speeds, high storage density and non-volatility is driving the exploration of new materials in nanostructured form. Phase-change materials, which can be reversibly switched between amorphous and crystalline states, are promising in this respect, but top-down processing of these materials into nanostructures often damages their useful properties. Self-assembled nanowire-based phase-change material memory devices offer an attractive solution owing to their sub-lithographic sizes and unique geometry, coupled with the facile etch-free processes with which they can be fabricated. Here, we explore the effects of nanoscaling on the memory-storage capability of self-assembled Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> nanowires, an important phase-change material. Our measurements of write-current amplitude, switching speed, endurance and data retention time in these devices show that such nanowires are promising building blocks for non-volatile scalable memory and may represent the ultimate size limit in exploring current-induced phase transition in nanoscale systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Se-Ho Lee"", ""Yeonwoong Jung"", ""Ritesh Agarwal""]","Lee, SH., Jung, Y. & Agarwal, R.

letter,Magnetic exchange bias of more than 1 Tesla in a natural mineral intergrowth,"<p>Magnetic exchange bias is a phenomenon whereby the hysteresis loop of a &#8216;soft&#8217; magnetic phase is shifted by an amount H<sub>E</sub> along the applied field axis owing to its interaction with a &#8216;hard&#8217; magnetic phase. Since the discovery of exchange bias fifty years ago, the development of a general theory has been hampered by the uncertain nature of the interfaces between the hard and soft phases, commonly between an antiferromagnetic phase and a ferro- or ferrimagnetic phase. Exchange bias continues to be the subject of investigation because of its technological applications and because it is now possible to manipulate magnetic materials at the nanoscale. Here we present the first documented example of exchange bias of significant magnitude (&gt;1&#160;T) in a natural mineral. We demonstrate that exchange bias in this system is due to the interaction between coherently intergrown magnetic phases formed through a natural process of phase separation during slow cooling over millions of years. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that these intergrowths have a known crystallographic orientation with a known crystallographic structure and that the interfaces are coherent.</p>",[],False,"[""Suzanne A.

letter,A virus-based single-enzyme nanoreactor,"<p>Most enzyme studies are carried out in bulk aqueous solution, at the so-called ensemble level, but more recently studies have appeared in which enzyme activity is measured at the level of a single molecule, revealing previously unseen properties. To this end, enzymes have been chemically or physically anchored to a surface, which is often disadvantageous because it may lead to denaturation. In a natural environment, enzymes are present in a confined reaction space, which inspired us to develop a generic method to carry out single-enzyme experiments in the restricted spatial environment of a virus capsid. We report here the incorporation of individual horseradish peroxidase enzymes in the inner cavity of a virus, and describe single-molecule studies on their enzymatic behaviour.

article,Highly selective dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes using aromatic polymers,"<p>Solubilizing and purifying carbon nanotubes remains one of the foremost technological hurdles in their investigation and application. We report a dramatic improvement in the preparation of single-walled carbon nanotube solutions based on the ability of specific aromatic polymers to efficiently disperse certain nanotube species with a high degree of selectivity. Evidence of this is provided by optical absorbance and photoluminescence excitation spectra, which show suspensions corresponding to up to &#8764;60% relative concentration of a single species of isolated nanotubes with fluorescence quantum yields of up to 1.5%. Different polymers show the ability to discriminate between nanotube species in terms of either diameter or chiral angle. Modelling suggests that rigid-backbone polymers form ordered molecular structures surrounding the nanotubes with n-fold symmetry determined by the tube diameter.</p>",[],False,"[""Adrian Nish"", ""Jeong-Yuan Hwang"", ""James Doig"", ""Robin J.

article,Controlling optical gain in semiconducting polymers with nanoscale chain positioning and alignment,"<p>We control the chain conformation of a semiconducting polymer by encapsulating it within the aligned nanopores of a silica host. The confinement leads to polarized, low-threshold amplified spontaneous emission from the polymer chains. The polymer enters the porous silica film from only one face and the filling of the pores is therefore graded. As a result, the profile of the index of refraction in the film is also graded, in the direction normal to the pores, so that the composite film forms a low-loss, graded-index waveguide. The aligned polymer chains plus naturally formed waveguide are ideally configured for optical gain, with a threshold for amplified spontaneous emission that is twenty times lower than in comparable unoriented polymer films. Moreover, the optimal conditions for ASE are met in only one spatial orientation and with one polarization. The results show that nanometre-scale control of semiconducting polymer chain orientation and position leads to novel and desirable optical properties.</p>",[],False,"[""Ignacio B.

article,Label-free and high-resolution protein/DNA nanoarray analysis using Kelvin probe force microscopy,"<p>Using the scanning probe technique known as Kelvin probe force microscopy it is possible to successfully devise a sensor for charged biomolecules. The Kelvin probe force microscope is a tool for measuring local variations in surface potential across a substrate of interest. Because many biological molecules have a native state that includes the presence of charge centres (such as the negatively charged backbone of DNA), the formation of highly specific complexes between biomolecules will often be accompanied by local changes in charge density. By spatially resolving this variation in surface potential it is possible to measure the presence of a specific bound target biomolecule on a surface without the aid of special chemistries or any form of labelling. The Kelvin probe force microscope presented here is based on an atomic force microscopy nanoprobe offering high resolution (&lt;10&#160;nm), sensitivity (&lt;50&#160;nM) and speed (&gt;1,100&#160;&#181;m&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), and the ability to resolve as few as three nucleotide mismatches.</p>",[],False,"[""Asher K.
