progress article,Injectable nanocarriers for biodetoxification,"<p>Hospitals routinely treat patients suffering from overdoses of drugs or other toxic chemicals as a result of illicit drug consumption, suicide attempts or accidental exposures. However, for many life-threatening situations, specific antidotes are not available and treatment is largely based on emptying the stomach, administering activated charcoal or other general measures of intoxication support. A promising strategy for managing such overdoses is to inject nanocarriers that can extract toxic agents from intoxicated tissues. To be effective, the nanocarriers must remain in the blood long enough to sequester the toxic components and/or their metabolites, and the toxin bound complex must also remain stable until it is removed from the bloodstream. Here, we discuss the principles that govern the use of injectable nanocarriers in biodetoxification and review the pharmacological performance of a number of different approaches.</p>",[],False,"[""Jean-Christophe Leroux""]","Leroux, JC.

letter,Nano-architectures by covalent assembly of molecular building blocks,"<p>The construction of electronic devices from single molecular building blocks, which possess certain functions such as switching or rectifying and are connected by atomic-scale wires on a supporting surface, is an essential goal of molecular electronics. A key challenge is the controlled assembly of molecules into desired architectures by strong, that is, covalent, intermolecular connections, enabling efficient electron transport between the molecules and providing high stability. However, no molecular networks on surfaces &#8216;locked&#8217; by covalent interactions have been reported so far. Here, we show that such covalently bound molecular nanostructures can be formed on a gold surface upon thermal activation of porphyrin building blocks and their subsequent chemical reaction at predefined connection points. We demonstrate that the topology of these nanostructures can be precisely engineered by controlling the chemical structure of the building blocks. Our results represent a versatile route for future bottom-up construction of sophisticated electronic circuits and devices, based on individual functionalized molecules.</p>",[],False,"[""Leonhard Grill"", ""Matthew Dyer"", ""Leif Lafferentz"", ""Mats Persson"", ""Maike V.

letter,Single functional group interactions with individual carbon nanotubes,"<p>Carbon nanotubes display a consummate blend of materials properties that affect applications ranging from nanoelectronic circuits and biosensors to field emitters and membranes. These applications use the non-covalent interactions between the nanotubes and chemical functionalities, often involving a few molecules at a time. Despite their wide use, we still lack a fundamental understanding and molecular-level control of these interactions. We have used chemical force microscopy to measure the strength of the interactions of single chemical functional groups with the sidewalls of vapour-grown individual single-walled carbon nanotubes. Surprisingly, the interaction strength does not follow conventional trends of increasing polarity or hydrophobicity, and instead reflects the complex electronic interactions between the nanotube and the functional group. Ab initio calculations confirm the observed trends and predict binding force distributions for a single molecular contact that match the experimental results. Our analysis also reveals the important role of molecular linkage dynamics in determining interaction strength at the single functional group level.</p>",[],False,"[""Raymond W.

letter,Local ionic and electron heating in single-molecule junctions,"<p>A basic aim in molecular electronics is to understand transport through a single molecule connected to two electrodes. Substantial progress towards this goal has been made over the past decade as a result of advances in both experimental techniques and theoretical methods. Nonetheless, a fundamental and technologically important issue, current-induced local heating of molecules, has received much less attention. Here, we report on a combined experimental and theoretical study of local heating in single molecules (6-, 8- and 10-alkanedithiol) covalently attached to two gold electrodes as a function of applied bias and molecular length. We find that the effective local temperature of the molecular junction first increases with applied bias, and then decreases after reaching a maximum. At fixed bias, the effective temperature decreases with increasing molecular length. These experimental findings are in agreement with hydrodynamic predictions, which include both electron&#8211;phonon and electron&#8211;electron interactions.</p>",[],False,"[""Zhifeng Huang"", ""Fang Chen"", ""Roberto D'agosta"", ""Peter A.

letter,Spatial manipulation of nanoacoustic waves with nanoscale spot sizes,"<p>Coherent acoustic phonons are generated at terahertz frequencies when semiconductor quantum-well nanostructures are illuminated by femtosecond laser pulses. These phonons&#8212;also known as nanoacoustic waves&#8212;typically have wavelengths of tens of nanometres, which could prove useful in applications such as non-invasive ultrasonic imaging and sound amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation. However, optical diffraction effects mean that the nanoacoustic waves are produced with spot sizes on the micrometre scale. Near-field optical techniques can produce waves with smaller spot sizes, but they only work near surfaces. Here, we show that a far-field optical technique&#8212;which suffers no such restrictions&#8212;can be used to spatially manipulate the phonon generation process so that nanoacoustic waves are emitted with lateral dimensions that are much smaller than the laser wavelength. We demonstrate that nanoacoustic waves with wavelengths and spot sizes of the order of 10&#160;nm and 100&#160;nm, respectively, can be generated and detected.</p>",[],False,"[""Kung-Hsuan Lin"", ""Chih-Ming Lai"", ""Chang-Chi Pan"", ""Jen-Inn Chyi"", ""Jin-Wei Shi"", ""Shih-Ze Sun"", ""Chieh-Feng Chang"", ""Chi-Kuang Sun""]","Lin, KH., Lai, CM., Pan, CC. et al.

letter,A charge-driven molecular water pump,"<p>Understanding and controlling the transport of water across nanochannels is of great importance for designing novel molecular devices, machines and sensors and has wide applications, including the desalination of seawater. Nanopumps driven by electric or magnetic fields can transport ions and magnetic quanta, but water is charge-neutral and has no magnetic moment. On the basis of molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a design for a molecular water pump. The design uses a combination of charges positioned adjacent to a nanopore and is inspired by the structure of channels in the cellular membrane that conduct water in and out of the cell (aquaporins). The remarkable pumping ability is attributed to the charge dipole-induced ordering of water confined in the nanochannels, where water can be easily driven by external fields in a concerted fashion. These findings may provide possibilities for developing water transport devices that function without osmotic pressure or a hydrostatic pressure gradient.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaojing Gong"", ""Jingyuan Li"", ""Hangjun Lu"", ""Rongzheng Wan"", ""Jichen Li"", ""Jun Hu"", ""Haiping Fang""]","Gong, X., Li, J., Lu, H. et al.A charge-driven molecular water pump.

letter,Direct imaging of single-walled carbon nanotubes in cells,"<p>The development of single-walled carbon nanotubes for various biomedical applications is an area of great promise. However, the contradictory data on the toxic effects of single-walled carbon nanotubes highlight the need for alternative ways to study their uptake and cytotoxic effects in cells. Single-walled carbon nanotubes have been shown to be acutely toxic in a number of types of cells, but the direct observation of cellular uptake of single-walled carbon nanotubes has not been demonstrated previously due to difficulties in discriminating carbon-based nanotubes from carbon-rich cell structures. Here we use transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to image the translocation of single-walled carbon nanotubes into cells in both stained and unstained human cells.

letter,Sequence-specific detection of individual DNA polymerase complexes in real time using a nanopore,"<p>Nanoscale pores have potential to be used as biosensors and are an established tool for analysing the structure and composition of single DNA or RNA molecules. Recently, nanopores have been used to measure the binding of enzymes to their DNA substrates. In this technique, a polynucleotide bound to an enzyme is drawn into the nanopore by an applied voltage. The force exerted on the charged backbone of the polynucleotide by the electric field is used to examine the enzyme&#8211;polynucleotide interactions. Here we show that a nanopore sensor can accurately identify DNA templates bound in the catalytic site of individual DNA polymerase molecules. Discrimination among unbound DNA, binary DNA/polymerase complexes, and ternary DNA/polymerase/deoxynucleotide triphosphate complexes was achieved in real time using finite state machine logic. This technique is applicable to numerous enzymes that bind or modify DNA or RNA including exonucleases, kinases and other polymerases.</p>",[],False,"[""Seico Benner"", ""Roger J. A.

article,Doping and phonon renormalization in carbon nanotubes,"<p>We show that the Raman frequency associated with the vibrational mode at &#8764;1,580 cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (the G mode) in both metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes shifts in response to changes in the charge density induced by an external gate field. These changes in the Raman spectra provide us with a powerful tool for probing local doping in carbon nanotubes in electronic device structures, or charge carrier densities induced by environmental interactions, on a length scale determined by the light diffraction limit. The G mode shifts to higher frequency and narrows in linewidth in metallic carbon nanotubes at large fields. This behaviour is analogous to that observed recently in graphene. In semiconducting carbon nanotubes, on the other hand, induced changes in the charge density only shift the phonon frequency, but do not affect its linewidth. These spectral changes are quantitatively explained by a model that involves the renormalization of the carbon nanotube phonon energy by the electron&#8211;phonon interaction as the carrier density in the carbon nanotube is changed.</p>",[],False,"[""J.
