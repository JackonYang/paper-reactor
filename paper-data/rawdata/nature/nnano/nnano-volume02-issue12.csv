review article,Nanocarriers as an emerging platform for cancer therapy,"<p>Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and therapy. Advances in protein engineering and materials science have contributed to novel nanoscale targeting approaches that may bring new hope to cancer patients. Several therapeutic nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use. However, to date, there are only a few clinically approved nanocarriers that incorporate molecules to selectively bind and target cancer cells. This review examines some of the approved formulations and discusses the challenges in translating basic research to the clinic. We detail the arsenal of nanocarriers and molecules available for selective tumour targeting, and emphasize the challenges in cancer treatment.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Immune Disease Institute and Department of Anesthesia, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02115, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Dan Peer']}, {'address': ""Department of Medicine, HST Center for Biomedical Engineering, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", 'authors': ['Jeffrey M.

letter,Molecular beam epitaxy growth of free-standing plane-parallel InAs nanoplates,"<p>Free-standing nanostructures such as suspended carbon nanotubes, graphene layers, III-V nanorod photonic crystals and three-dimensional structures have recently attracted attention because they could form the basis of devices with unique electronic, optoelectronic and electromechanical characteristics. Here we report the growth by molecular beam epitaxy of free-standing nanoplates of InAs that are close to being atomically plane. The structural and transport properties of these semiconducting nanoplates have been examined with scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and low-temperature electron transport measurements. The carrier density of the nanoplates can be reduced to zero by applying a voltage to a nearby gate electrode, creating a new type of suspended quantum well that can be used to explore low-dimensional electron transport. The electronic and optical properties of such systems also make them potentially attractive for photovoltaic and sensing applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nano-Science Center, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 5, Copenhagen, DK-2100, Denmark', 'authors': ['Martin Aagesen', ',\xa0Erik Johnson', ',\xa0Claus B.

letter,A versatile approach for the processing of polymer nanocomposites with self-assembled nanofibre templates,"<p>The incorporation of nanoparticles into polymers is a design approach that is used in many areas of materials science. The concept is attractive because it enables the creation of materials with new or improved properties by mixing multiple constituents and exploiting synergistic effects. One important technological thrust is the development of structural materials with improved mechanical and thermal characteristics. Equally intriguing is the possibility to design functional materials with unique optical or electronic properties, catalytic activity or selective permeation. The broad technological exploitation of polymer nanocomposites is, however, stifled by the lack of effective methods to control nanoparticle dispersion. We report a simple and versatile process for the formation of homogeneous polymer/nanofibre composites. The approach is based on the formation of a three-dimensional template of well-individualized nanofibres, which is filled with any polymer of choice. We demonstrate that this template approach is broadly applicable and allows for the fabrication of otherwise inaccessible nanocomposites of immiscible components.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Macromolecular Science and Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, 2100 Adelbert Road, Cleveland, 44106, Ohio, USA', 'authors': ['Jeffrey R.

letter,Improved broadband and quasi-omnidirectional anti-reflection properties with biomimetic silicon nanostructures,"<p>Nature routinely produces nanostructured surfaces with useful properties, such as the self-cleaning lotus leaf, the colour of the butterfly wing, the photoreceptor in brittlestar and the anti-reflection observed in the moth eye. Scientists and engineers have been able to mimic some of these natural structures in the laboratory and in real-world applications. Here, we report a simple aperiodic array of silicon nanotips on a 6-inch wafer with a sub-wavelength structure that can suppress the reflection of light at a range of wavelengths from the ultraviolet, through the visible part of the spectrum, to the terahertz region. Reflection is suppressed for a wide range of angles of incidence and for both s- and p-polarized light. The antireflection properties of the silicon result from changes in the refractive index caused by variations in the height of the silicon nanotips, and can be simulated with models that have been used to explain the low reflection from moth eyes. The improved anti-reflection properties of the surfaces could have applications in renewable energy and electro-optical devices for the military.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, 106, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Yi-Fan Huang', ',\xa0Yi-Jun Jen', '\xa0&\xa0Cheng-Yu Peng']}, {'address': 'Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, 106, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Yi-Fan Huang', ',\xa0Yu-Kuei Hsu', '\xa0&\xa0Kuei-Hsien Chen']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, 402, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Surojit Chattopadhyay']}, {'address': 'Center for Measurement Standards, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, 300, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Tze-An Liu']}, {'address': 'Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, 300, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Ci-Ling Pan']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, 300, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Hung-Chun Lo']}, {'address': 'Center for Condensed Matter Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 106, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Chih-Hsun Hsu', '\xa0&\xa0Li-Chyong Chen']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Yuan-Huei Chang', '\xa0&\xa0Chih-Shan Lee']}]",False,"['Yi-Fan Huang', 'Surojit Chattopadhyay', 'Yi-Jun Jen', 'Cheng-Yu Peng', 'Tze-An Liu', 'Yu-Kuei Hsu', 'Ci-Ling Pan', 'Hung-Chun Lo', 'Chih-Hsun Hsu', 'Yuan-Huei Chang', 'Chih-Shan Lee', 'Kuei-Hsien Chen', 'Li-Chyong Chen']","Huang, Y., Chattopadhyay, S., Jen, Y. et al.

letter,Recapturing and trapping single molecules with a solid-state nanopore,"<p>The development of solid-state nanopores, inspired by their biological counterparts, shows great potential for the study of single macromolecules. Applications such as DNA sequencing and the exploration of protein folding require control of the dynamics of the molecule's interaction with the pore, but DNA capture by a solid-state nanopore is not well understood. By recapturing individual molecules soon after they pass through a nanopore, we reveal the mechanism by which double-stranded DNA enters the pore. The observed recapture rates and times agree with solutions of a drift-diffusion model. Electric forces draw DNA to the pore over micrometer-scale distances, and upon arrival at the pore, molecules begin translocation almost immediately. Repeated translocation of the same molecule improves measurement accuracy, offers a way to probe the chemical transformations and internal dynamics of macromolecules on sub-millisecond time and sub-micrometre length scales, and demonstrates the ability to trap, study and manipulate individual macromolecules in solution.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Marc Gershow', '\xa0&\xa0J.

letter,Nanomechanical analysis of cells from cancer patients,"<p>Change in cell stiffness is a new characteristic of cancer cells that affects the way they spread. Despite several studies on architectural changes in cultured cell lines, no ex vivo mechanical analyses of cancer cells obtained from patients have been reported. Using atomic force microscopy, we report the stiffness of live metastatic cancer cells taken from the body (pleural) fluids of patients with suspected lung, breast and pancreas cancer. Within the same sample, we find that the cell stiffness of metastatic cancer cells is more than 70% softer, with a standard deviation over five times narrower, than the benign cells that line the body cavity. Different cancer types were found to display a common stiffness. Our work shows that mechanical analysis can distinguish cancerous cells from normal ones even when they show similar shapes. These results show that nanomechanical analysis correlates well with immunohistochemical testing currently used for detecting cancer.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA', 'authors': ['Sarah E.

article,"Downscaling of self-aligned, all-printed polymer thin-film transistors","<p>Printing is an emerging approach for low-cost, large-area manufacturing of electronic circuits, but it has the disadvantages of poor resolution, large overlap capacitances, and film thickness limitations, resulting in slow circuit speeds and high operating voltages. Here, we demonstrate a self-aligned printing approach that allows downscaling of printed organic thin-film transistors to channel lengths of 100&#8211;400&#160;nm. The use of a crosslinkable polymer gate dielectric with 30&#8211;50&#160;nm thickness ensures that basic scaling requirements are fulfilled and that operating voltages are below 5&#160;V. The device architecture minimizes contact resistance effects, enabling clean scaling of transistor current with channel length. A self-aligned gate configuration minimizes parasitic overlap capacitance to values as low as 0.2&#8211;0.6&#160;pF&#160;mm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and allows transition frequencies of f<sub>T</sub>&#160;=&#160;1.6&#160;MHz to be reached.
