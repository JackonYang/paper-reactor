letter,Plumbing carbon nanotubes,"<p>Since their discovery, the possibility of connecting carbon nanotubes together like water pipes has been an intriguing prospect for these hollow nanostructures. The serial joining of carbon nanotubes in a controlled manner offers a promising approach for the bottom-up engineering of nanotube structures&#8212;from simply increasing their aspect ratio to making integrated carbon nanotube devices. To date, however, there have been few reports of the joining of two different carbon nanotubes. Here we demonstrate that a Joule heating process, and associated electro-migration effects, can be used to connect two carbon nanotubes that have the same (or similar) diameters. More generally, with the assistance of a tungsten metal particle, this technique can be used to seamlessly join any two carbon nanotubes&#8212;regardless of their diameters&#8212;to form new nanotube structures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Center for Advanced Carbon Materials, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Central 5, Tsukuba, 305-8565, Japan', 'authors': ['Chuanhong Jin', ',\xa0Kazu Suenaga', '\xa0&\xa0Sumio Iijima']}]",False,"['Chuanhong Jin', 'Kazu Suenaga', 'Sumio Iijima']","Jin, C., Suenaga, K. & Iijima, S.

letter,Colossal magnetic anisotropy of monatomic free and deposited platinum nanowires,"<p>Whenever a nanosystem such as an adatom, a cluster or a nanowire spontaneously magnetizes, a crucial parameter is its magnetic anisotropy, the intrinsic preference of magnetization to lie along an easy axis. Anisotropy is important in nanosystems because it helps reduce the magnitude of thermal (superparamagnetic) fluctuations, it can modify the flow of current, and it can induce new phenomena, such as the quantum tunnelling of magnetization. We discuss here, on the basis of density functional calculations, the novel and unconventional feature of colossal magnetic anisotropy&#8212;the strict impossibility of magnetization to rotate from the parallel to the orthogonal direction&#8212;which, owing to a quantum mechanical selection rule, the recently predicted Pt nanowire magnetism should exhibit. Model calculations suggest that the colossal magnetic anisotropy of a Pt chain should persist after weak adsorption on an inert substrate or surface step.</p>",,"[{'address': 'International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Strada Costiera 11, Trieste, I-34014, Italy', 'authors': ['A.

letter,Nanoscale memory cell based on a nanoelectromechanical switched capacitor,"<p>The demand for increased information storage densities has pushed silicon technology to its limits and led to a focus on research on novel materials and device structures, such as magnetoresistive random access memory and carbon nanotube field-effect transistors, for ultra-large-scale integrated memory. Electromechanical devices are suitable for memory applications because of their excellent &#8216;ON&#8211;OFF&#8217; ratios and fast switching characteristics, but they involve larger cells and more complex fabrication processes than silicon-based arrangements. Nanoelectromechanical devices based on carbon nanotubes have been reported previously, but it is still not possible to control the number and spatial location of nanotubes over large areas with the precision needed for the production of integrated circuits. Here we report a novel nanoelectromechanical switched capacitor structure based on vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes in which the mechanical movement of a nanotube relative to a carbon nanotube based capacitor defines &#8216;ON&#8217; and &#8216;OFF&#8217; states. The carbon nanotubes are grown with controlled dimensions at pre-defined locations on a silicon substrate in a process that could be made compatible with existing silicon technology, and the vertical orientation allows for a significant decrease in cell area over conventional devices. We have written data to the structure and it should be possible to read data with standard dynamic random access memory sensing circuitry. Simulations suggest that the use of high-k dielectrics in the capacitors will increase the capacitance to the levels needed for dynamic random access memory applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Electrical Engineering Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, 9 JJ Thomson Avenue, Cambridge, CB3 0FA, UK', 'authors': ['Jae Eun Jang', ',\xa0Seung Nam Cha', ',\xa0Young Jin Choi', ',\xa0Tim P.

letter,High-performance lithium battery anodes using silicon nanowires,"<p>There is great interest in developing rechargeable lithium batteries with higher energy capacity and longer cycle life for applications in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and implantable medical devices. Silicon is an attractive anode material for lithium batteries because it has a low discharge potential and the highest known theoretical charge capacity (4,200&#160;mAh&#160;g<sup>&#8722;1</sup>; ref.&#160;). Although this is more than ten times higher than existing graphite anodes and much larger than various nitride and oxide materials, silicon anodes have limited applications because silicon's volume changes by 400% upon insertion and extraction of lithium which results in pulverization and capacity fading. Here, we show that silicon nanowire battery electrodes circumvent these issues as they can accommodate large strain without pulverization, provide good electronic contact and conduction, and display short lithium insertion distances. We achieved the theoretical charge capacity for silicon anodes and maintained a discharge capacity close to 75% of this maximum, with little fading during cycling.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Candace K.

letter,Nanomagnetic actuation of receptor-mediated signal transduction,"<p>Complex cell behaviours are triggered by chemical ligands that bind to membrane receptors and alter intracellular signal transduction. However, future biosensors, medical devices and other microtechnologies that incorporate living cells as system components will require actuation mechanisms that are much more rapid, robust, non-invasive and easily integrated with solid-state interfaces. Here we describe a magnetic nanotechnology that activates a biochemical signalling mechanism normally switched on by binding of multivalent chemical ligands. Superparamagnetic 30-nm beads, coated with monovalent ligands and bound to transmembrane receptors, magnetize when exposed to magnetic fields, and aggregate owing to bead&#8211;bead attraction in the plane of the membrane. Associated clustering of the bound receptors acts as a nanomagnetic cellular switch that directly transduces magnetic inputs into physiological cellular outputs, with rapid system responsiveness and non-invasive dynamic control. This technique may represent a new actuator mechanism for cell-based microtechnologies and man&#8211;machine interfaces.</p>",,"[{'address': ""Departments of Pathology and Surgery, Vascular Biology Program, Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital, Boston, 02115, Massachusetts, USA"", 'authors': ['Robert J.

letter,Nanotube-assisted protein deactivation,"<p>Conjugating proteins onto carbon nanotubes has numerous applications in biosensing, imaging and cellular delivery. However, remotely controlling the activity of proteins in these conjugates has never been demonstrated. Here we show that upon near-infrared irradiation, carbon nanotubes mediate the selective deactivation of proteins in situ by photochemical effects. We designed nanotube&#8211;peptide conjugates to selectively destroy the anthrax toxin, and also optically transparent coatings that can self-clean following either visible or near-infrared irradiation. Nanotube-assisted protein deactivation may be broadly applicable to the selective destruction of pathogens and cells, and will have applications ranging from antifouling coatings to functional proteomics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'The Howard P.

article,Carrier-mediated magnetoelectricity in complex oxide heterostructures,"<p>Increasing demands for high-density, stable nanoscale memory elements, as well as fundamental discoveries in the field of spintronics, have led to renewed interest in exploring the coupling between magnetism and electric fields. Although conventional magnetoelectric routes often result in weak responses, there is considerable current research activity focused on identifying new mechanisms for magnetoelectric coupling. Here we demonstrate a linear magnetoelectric effect that arises from a carrier-mediated mechanism, and is a universal feature of the interface between a dielectric and a spin-polarized metal. Using first-principles density functional calculations, we illustrate this effect at the SrRuO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> interface and describe its origin. To formally quantify the magnetic response of such an interface to an applied electric field, we introduce and define the concept of spin capacitance. In addition to its magnetoelectric and spin capacitive behaviour, the interface displays a spatial coexistence of magnetism and dielectric polarization, suggesting a route to a new type of interfacial multiferroic.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, 93106-5050, California, USA', 'authors': ['James M.

article,Nanoprecipitation-assisted ion current oscillations,"<p>Nanoscale pores exhibit transport properties that are not seen in micrometre-scale pores, such as increased ionic concentrations inside the pore relative to the bulk solution, ionic selectivity and ionic rectification. These nanoscale effects are all caused by the presence of permanent surface charges on the walls of the pore. Here we report a new phenomenon in which the addition of small amounts of divalent cations to a buffered monovalent ionic solution results in an oscillating ionic current through a conical nanopore. This behaviour is caused by the transient formation and redissolution of nanoprecipitates, which temporarily block the ionic current through the pore. The frequency and character of ionic current instabilities are regulated by the potential across the membrane and the chemistry of the precipitate. We discuss how oscillating nanopores could be used as model systems for studying nonlinear electrochemical processes and the early stages of crystallization in sub-femtolitre volumes. Such nanopore systems might also form the basis for a stochastic sensor.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Irvine, 92697, California, USA', 'authors': ['Matthew R.
