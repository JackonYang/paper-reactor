progress article,Nucleic acid and nucleotide-mediated synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles,"<p>Since the advent of practical methods for achieving DNA metallization, the use of nucleic acids as templates for the synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) has become an active area of study. It is now widely recognized that nucleic acids have the ability to control the growth and morphology of inorganic NPs. These biopolymers are particularly appealing as templating agents as their ease of synthesis in conjunction with the possibility of screening nucleotide composition, sequence and length, provides the means to modulate the physico-chemical properties of the resulting NPs. Several synthetic procedures leading to NPs with interesting photophysical properties as well as studies aimed at rationalizing the mechanism of nucleic acid-templated NP synthesis are now being reported. This progress article will outline the current understanding of the nucleic acid-templated process and provides an up to date reference in this nascent field.</p>",[],False,"[""Lorenzo Berti"", ""Glenn A.

letter,Bottom-up assembly of large-area nanowire resonator arrays,"<p>Directed-assembly of nanowire-based devices will enable the development of integrated circuits with new functions that extend well beyond mainstream digital logic. For example, nanoelectromechanical resonators are very attractive for chip-based sensor arrays because of their potential for ultrasensitive mass detection. In this letter, we introduce a new bottom-up assembly method to fabricate large-area nanoelectromechanical arrays each having over 2,000 single-nanowire resonators. The nanowires are synthesized and chemically functionalized before they are integrated onto a silicon chip at predetermined locations. Peptide nucleic acid probe molecules attached to the nanowires before assembly maintain their binding selectivity and recognize complementary oligonucleotide targets once the resonator array is assembled. The two types of cantilevered resonators we integrated here using silicon and rhodium nanowires had Q-factors of &#8764;4,500 and &#8764;1,150, respectively, in vacuum. Taken together, these results show that bottom-up nanowire assembly can offer a practical alternative to top-down fabrication for sensitive chip-based detection.</p>",[],False,"[""Mingwei Li"", ""Rustom B.

letter,"Reconfigurable, braced, three-dimensional DNA nanostructures","<p>DNA nanotechnology makes use of the exquisite self-recognition of DNA in order to build on a molecular scale. Although static structures may find applications in structural biology and computer science, many applications in nanomedicine and nanorobotics require the additional capacity for controlled three-dimensional movement. DNA architectures can span three dimensions and DNA devices are capable of movement, but active control of well-defined three-dimensional structures has not been achieved. We demonstrate the operation of reconfigurable DNA tetrahedra whose shapes change precisely and reversibly in response to specific molecular signals. Shape changes are confirmed by gel electrophoresis and by bulk and single-molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer measurements. DNA tetrahedra are natural building blocks for three-dimensional construction; they may be synthesized rapidly with high yield of a single stereoisomer, and their triangulated architecture conveys structural stability. The introduction of shape-changing structural modules opens new avenues for the manipulation of matter on the nanometre scale.</p>",[],False,"[""Russell P.

letter,An all-metallic logic gate based on current-driven domain wall motion,"<p>The walls of magnetic domains can become trapped in a ferromagnetic metallic point contact when the thickness of the film and the width of the contact are less than their critical values. The discovery that domain walls can be moved from such constrictions by a sufficiently large current has attracted considerable attention from researchers working on both fundamental research and potential applications. Here we show that Invar nanocontacts fabricated on silica substrates exhibit a sharp drop in resistance with increasing bias voltage at room temperature in the absence of an applied magnetic field. Moreover, when two nanocontacts are combined in an all-metallic comparison circuit, it is possible to perform logical NOT operations. The use of electrical currents rather than applied magnetic fields to control the domain walls also reduces energy consumption and the risk of crosstalk in devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Peng Xu"", ""Ke Xia"", ""Changzhi Gu"", ""Ling Tang"", ""Haifang Yang"", ""Junjie Li""]","Xu, P., Xia, K., Gu, C. et al.

article,Processable aqueous dispersions of graphene nanosheets,"<p>Graphene sheets offer extraordinary electronic, thermal and mechanical properties and are expected to find a variety of applications. A prerequisite for exploiting most proposed applications for graphene is the availability of processable graphene sheets in large quantities. The direct dispersion of hydrophobic graphite or graphene sheets in water without the assistance of dispersing agents has generally been considered to be an insurmountable challenge. Here we report that chemically converted graphene sheets obtained from graphite can readily form stable aqueous colloids through electrostatic stabilization. This discovery has enabled us to develop a facile approach to large-scale production of aqueous graphene dispersions without the need for polymeric or surfactant stabilizers. Our findings make it possible to process graphene materials using low-cost solution processing techniques, opening up enormous opportunities to use this unique carbon nanostructure for many technological applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Dan Li"", ""Marc B.

article,Quantum size effect in TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by finely controlled metal assembly on dendrimer templates,"<p>The use of dendrimer templates to make metal-based nanoparticles of controlled size has attracted much interest. These highly branched macromolecules have well-defined structures that enable them to bind metal ions to generate precursors that can be converted into nanoparticles. We describe the sub-nanometre size control of both anatase and rutile forms of TiO<sub>2</sub> particles with phenylazomethine dendrimers, leading to samples with very narrow size distributions. Such fine tuning is possible because both the number and location of metal ions can be precisely controlled in these templates. Quantum size effects are observed in the particles, and the energy gap between the conduction and valence bands exhibits a blueshift with decreasing particle size and is dependent on the crystal form of the material. The dependency of the bandgap energy on these factors is explained using a semi-empirical effective mass approximation.</p>",[],False,"[""Norifusa Satoh"", ""Toshio Nakashima"", ""Kenta Kamikura"", ""Kimihisa Yamamoto""]","Satoh, N., Nakashima, T., Kamikura, K. et al.

article,Molecular discrimination inside polymer nanotubules,"<p>Recognition of small organic molecules and large biomolecules such as proteins is of great importance in pharmaceutical as well as biological applications. Recognition inside a nanoporous membrane is particularly attractive, because of the advantages associated with ligand&#8211;receptor interactions in confined spaces. Classical nanoporous membrane-based separations simply use the difference in size of the analytes relative to pore size in the membrane. In order to bring about selectivity beyond size, it is necessary that methods for functionalizing the membrane pores are readily available. Here, we describe a simple approach to functionalize the nanopores within these membranes using self-assembling and non-self-assembling polymers. We show that these modified membranes separate small molecules based on size, charge and hydrophobicity. We also demonstrate here that proteins can be differentially transported through the nanopores based on their size and/or electrostatics.</p>",[],False,"[""Elamprakash N. Savariar"", ""K.
