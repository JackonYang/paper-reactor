progress article,Remote control of cellular behaviour with magnetic nanoparticles,"<p>By binding magnetic nanoparticles to the surface of cells, it is possible to manipulate and control cell function with an external magnetic field. The technique of activating cells with magnetic nanoparticles offers a means to isolate and explore cellular mechanics and ion channel activation to gain better understanding of these processes. Here, we go beyond using this technique as an investigative tool and focus on its potential to actively control cellular functions and processes with an eye towards biological and clinical applications. In particular, we focus on applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</p>",[],False,"[""Jon Dobson""]","Dobson, J. Remote control of cellular behaviour with magnetic nanoparticles.

letter,Nanoparticle-mediated cellular response is size-dependent,"<p>Nanostructures of different sizes, shapes and material properties have many applications in biomedical imaging, clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. In spite of what has been achieved so far, a complete understanding of how cells interact with nanostructures of well-defined sizes, at the molecular level, remains poorly understood. Here we show that gold and silver nanoparticles coated with antibodies can regulate the process of membrane receptor internalization. The binding and activation of membrane receptors and subsequent protein expression strongly depend on nanoparticle size. Although all nanoparticles within the 2&#8211;100&#160;nm size range were found to alter signalling processes essential for basic cell functions (including cell death), 40- and 50-nm nanoparticles demonstrated the greatest effect. These results show that nanoparticles should no longer be viewed as simple carriers for biomedical applications, but can also play an active role in mediating biological effects. The findings presented here may assist in the design of nanoscale delivery and therapeutic systems and provide insights into nanotoxicity.</p>",[],False,"[""Wen Jiang"", ""Betty Y. S.

letter,Mesoporous silicon particles as a multistage delivery system for imaging and therapeutic applications,"<p>Many nanosized particulate systems are being developed as intravascular carriers to increase the levels of therapeutic agents delivered to targets, with the fewest side effects. The surface of these carriers is often functionalized with biological recognition molecules for specific, targeted delivery. However, there are a series of biological barriers in the body that prevent these carriers from localizing at their targets at sufficiently high therapeutic concentrations. Here we show a multistage delivery system that can carry, release over time and deliver two types of nanoparticles into primary endothelial cells. The multistage delivery system is based on biodegradable and biocompatible mesoporous silicon particles that have well-controlled shapes, sizes and pores. The use of this system is envisioned to open new avenues for avoiding biological barriers and delivering more than one therapeutic agent to the target at a time, in a time-controlled fashion.</p>",[],False,"[""Ennio Tasciotti"", ""Xuewu Liu"", ""Rohan Bhavane"", ""Kevin Plant"", ""Ashley D.

letter,Controlled cobalt doping of magnetosomes in vivo,"<p>Magnetotactic bacteria biomineralize iron into magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles that are surrounded by lipid vesicles. These &#8216;magnetosomes&#8217; have considerable potential for use in bio- and nanotechnological applications because of their narrow size and shape distribution and inherent biocompatibility. The ability to tailor the magnetic properties of magnetosomes by chemical doping would greatly expand these applications; however, the controlled doping of magnetosomes has so far not been achieved. Here, we report controlled in vivo cobalt doping of magnetosomes in three strains of the bacterium Magnetospirillum. The presence of cobalt increases the coercive field of the magnetosomes&#8212;that is, the field necessary to reverse their magnetization&#8212;by 36&#8211;45%, depending on the strain and the cobalt content. With elemental analysis, X-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism, we estimate the cobalt content to be between 0.2 and 1.4%. These findings provide an important advance in designing biologically synthesized nanoparticles with useful highly tuned magnetic properties.</p>",[],False,"[""Sarah Staniland"", ""Wyn Williams"", ""Neil Telling"", ""Gerrit Van Der Laan"", ""Andrew Harrison"", ""Bruce Ward""]","Staniland, S., Williams, W., Telling, N. et al.

article,Conductivity of a single DNA duplex bridging a carbon nanotube gap,"<p>We describe a general method to integrate DNA strands between single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and to measure their electrical properties. We modified DNA sequences with amines on either the 5&#8242; terminus or both the 3&#8242; and 5&#8242; termini and coupled these to the single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes through amide linkages, enabling the electrical properties of complementary and mismatched strands to be measured. Well-matched duplex DNA in the gap between the electrodes exhibits a resistance on the order of 1 M&#937;. A single GT or CA mismatch in a DNA 15-mer increases the resistance of the duplex &#8764;300-fold relative to a well-matched one. Certain DNA sequences oriented within this gap are substrates for Alu I, a blunt end restriction enzyme. This enzyme cuts the DNA and eliminates the conductive path, supporting the supposition that the DNA is in its native conformation when bridging the ends of the single-walled carbon nanotubes.</p>",[],False,"[""Xuefeng Guo"", ""Alon A.

article,High-resolution detection of Au catalyst atoms in Si nanowires,"<p>The potential for the metal nanocatalyst to contaminate vapour&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid grown semiconductor nanowires has been a long-standing concern, because the most common catalyst material, Au, is highly detrimental to the performance of minority carrier electronic devices. We have detected single Au atoms in Si nanowires grown using Au nanocatalyst particles in a vapour&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid process. Using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, Au atoms were observed in higher numbers than expected from a simple extrapolation of the bulk solubility to the low growth temperature. Direct measurements of the minority carrier diffusion length versus nanowire diameter, however, demonstrate that surface recombination controls minority carrier transport in as-grown n-type nanowires; the influence of Au is negligible. These results advance the quantitative correlation of atomic-scale structure with the properties of nanomaterials and can provide essential guidance to the development of nanowire-based device technologies.</p>",[],False,"[""Jonathan E.

article,Classification and control of the origin of photoluminescence from Si nanocrystals,"<p>Silicon dominates the electronics industry, but its poor optical properties mean that III&#8211;V compound semiconductors are preferred for photonics applications. Photoluminescence at visible wavelengths was observed from porous Si at room temperature in 1990, but the origin of these photons (do they arise from highly localized defect states or quantum confinement effects?) has been the subject of intense debate ever since. Attention has subsequently shifted from porous Si to Si nanocrystals, but the same fundamental question about the origin of the photoluminescence has remained. Here we show, based on measurements in high magnetic fields, that defects are the dominant source of light from Si nanocrystals. Moreover, we show that it is possible to control the origin of the photoluminescence in a single sample: passivation with hydrogen removes the defects, resulting in photoluminescence from quantum-confined states, but subsequent ultraviolet illumination reintroduces the defects, making them the origin of the light again.</p>",[],False,"[""S.
