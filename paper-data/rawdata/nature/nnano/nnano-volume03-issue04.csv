letter,Self-organized nanotube serpentines,"<p>Carbon nanotubes have unique mechanical, electronic, optical and thermal properties, which make them attractive building blocks in the field of nanotechnology. However, their organization into well-defined straight or curved geometries and arrays on surfaces remains a critical challenge for their integration into functional nanosystems. Here we show that combined surface- and flow-directed growth enable the controlled formation of uniquely complex and coherent geometries of single-walled carbon nanotubes, including highly oriented and periodic serpentines and coils. We propose a mechanism of non-equilibrium self-organization, in which competing dissipative forces of adhesion and aerodynamic drag induce oscillations in the nanotubes as they adsorb on the surface. Our results demonstrate the use of &#8216;order through fluctuations&#8217; to shape nanostructures into complex geometries. The nanotube serpentines and loops are shown to be electrically conducting and could therefore find a wide range of potential applications, such as receiving and transmitting antennas, heating and cooling elements, optoelectronic devices and single-molecule dynamos.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials and Interfaces, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel', 'authors': ['Noam Geblinger', ',\xa0Ariel Ismach', '\xa0&\xa0Ernesto Joselevich']}]",False,"['Noam Geblinger', 'Ariel Ismach', 'Ernesto Joselevich']","Geblinger, N., Ismach, A. & Joselevich, E.

letter,Terahertz time-domain measurement of ballistic electron resonance in a single-walled carbon nanotube,"<p>Understanding the physics of low-dimensional systems and the operation of next-generation electronics will depend on our ability to measure the electrical properties of nanomaterials at terahertz frequencies (&#8764;100 GHz to 10 THz). Single-walled carbon nanotubes are prototypical one-dimensional nanomaterials because of their unique band structure and long carrier mean free path. Although nanotube transistors have been studied at microwave frequencies (100&#160;MHz to 50&#160;GHz), no techniques currently exist to probe their terahertz response. Here, we describe the first terahertz electrical measurements of single-walled carbon nanotube transistors performed in the time domain. We observe a ballistic electron resonance that corresponds to the round-trip transit of an electron along the nanotube with a picosecond-scale period. The electron velocity is found to be constant and equal to the Fermi velocity, showing that the high-frequency electron response is dominated by single-particle excitations rather than collective plasmon modes. These results demonstrate a powerful new tool for directly probing picosecond electron motion in nanostructures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Nanoscale Systems, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 14853, USA', 'authors': ['Zhaohui Zhong', ',\xa0Nathaniel M.

letter,Intrinsic and extrinsic performance limits of graphene devices on SiO2,"<p>The linear dispersion relation in graphene gives rise to a surprising prediction: the resistivity due to isotropic scatterers, such as white-noise disorder or phonons, is independent of carrier density, n. Here we show that electron&#8211;acoustic phonon scattering is indeed independent of n, and contributes only 30&#160;&#937; to graphene's room-temperature resistivity. At a technologically relevant carrier density of 1&#160;&#215;10<sup>12</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, we infer a mean free path for electron&#8211;acoustic phonon scattering of &gt;2&#160;&#181;m and an intrinsic mobility limit of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup>&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

A strongly temperature-dependent resistivity contribution is observed above &#8764;200 K (ref.); its magnitude, temperature dependence and carrier-density dependence are consistent with extrinsic scattering by surface phonons at the SiO<sub>2</sub> substrate and limit the room-temperature mobility to &#8764;4 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup>&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, indicating the importance of substrate choice for graphene devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, 20742, USA', 'authors': ['Jian-Hao Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Michael S.

letter,Monitoring dopants by Raman scattering in an electrochemically top-gated graphene transistor,"<p>The recent discovery of graphene has led to many advances in two-dimensional physics and devices. The graphene devices fabricated so far have relied on SiO<sub>2</sub> back gating. Electrochemical top gating is widely used for polymer transistors, and has also been successfully applied to carbon nanotubes. Here we demonstrate a top-gated graphene transistor that is able to reach doping levels of up to 5&#215;10<sup>13</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, which is much higher than those previously reported. Such high doping levels are possible because the nanometre-thick Debye layer in the solid polymer electrolyte gate provides a much higher gate capacitance than the commonly used SiO<sub>2</sub> back gate, which is usually about 300&#160;nm thick. In situ Raman measurements monitor the doping. The G peak stiffens and sharpens for both electron and hole doping, but the 2D peak shows a different response to holes and electrons. The ratio of the intensities of the G and 2D peaks shows a strong dependence on doping, making it a sensitive parameter to monitor the doping.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India', 'authors': ['A.

letter,A pilot toxicology study of single-walled carbon nanotubes in a small sample of mice,"<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are currently under evaluation in biomedical applications, including in vivo delivery of drugs, proteins, peptides and nucleic acids (for gene transfer or gene silencing), in vivo tumour imaging and tumour targeting of single-walled carbon nanotubes as an anti-neoplastic treatment. However, concerns about the potential toxicity of single-walled carbon nanotubes have been raised. Here we examine the acute and chronic toxicity of functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes when injected into the bloodstream of mice. Survival, clinical and laboratory parameters reveal no evidence of toxicity over 4 months. Upon killing, careful necropsy and tissue histology show age-related changes only. Histology and Raman microscopic mapping demonstrate that functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes persisted within liver and spleen macrophages for 4 months without apparent toxicity. Although this is a preliminary study with a small group of animals, our results encourage further confirmation studies with larger groups of animals.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Radiology and Bio-X Program, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS), California, Palo Alto, 94305-5427, USA', 'authors': ['Meike L.

article,"Dipole-directed assembly of lines of 1,5-dichloropentane on silicon substrates by displacement of surface charge","<p>One-dimensional nanostructures at silicon surfaces have potential applications in nanoscale devices. Here we propose a mechanism of dipole-directed assembly for the growth of lines of physisorbed dipolar molecules. The adsorbate chosen was a halide, in preparation for the patterned imprinting of halogen atoms. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, physisorbed 1,5-dichloropentane on Si(100)-2&#215;1 was shown to self-assemble at room temperature into molecular lines that grew predominantly perpendicular to the Si-dimer rows. Line formation was triggered by the displacement of surface charge by the dipolar adsorbate. Experimental and simulated scanning tunnelling microscopy images were in agreement for a range of positive and negative bias voltages. The geometry of the physisorbed molecules and nature of their binding were evident from the scanning tunnelling microscopy images, as interpreted by scanning tunnelling microscopy simulation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Institute of Optical Sciences, University of Toronto, 80 St George Street, Toronto, M5S 3H6, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['K.

article,Reversible electron-transfer reactions within a nanoscale metal oxide cage mediated by metallic substrates,"<p>Transition metal oxides exhibit a rich collection of electronic properties and have many practical applications in areas such as catalysis and ultra-high-density magnetic data storage. Therefore the development of switchable molecular transition metal oxides has potential for the engineering of single-molecule devices and nanoscale electronics. At present, the electronic properties of transition metal oxides can only be tailored through the irreversible introduction of dopant ions, modifying the electronic structure by either injecting electrons or core holes. Here we show that a molybdenum(VI) oxide &#8216;polyoxometalate&#8217; molecular nanocluster containing two embedded redox agents is activated by a metallic surface and can reversibly interconvert between two electronic states. Upon thermal activation two electrons are ejected from the active sulphite anions and delocalized over the metal oxide cluster cage, switching it from a fully oxidized state to a two-electron reduced state along with the concomitant formation of an S&#8211;S bonding interaction between the two sulphur centres inside the cluster shell.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, UK', 'authors': ['Christopher Fleming', ',\xa0De-Liang Long', ',\xa0Nicola McMillan', ',\xa0Jacqueline Johnston', ',\xa0Nicolas Bovet', ',\xa0Leroy Cronin', '\xa0&\xa0Malcolm Kadodwala']}, {'address': 'Physics Department, University of Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK', 'authors': ['Vin Dhanak']}, {'address': 'CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, WA4 4AD, UK', 'authors': ['Vin Dhanak']}, {'address': 'Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8LT, UK', 'authors': ['Jacqueline Johnston', '\xa0&\xa0Nikolaj Gadegaard']}, {'address': 'Ames Laboratory and Department of Physics & Astronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA', 'authors': ['Paul Kögerler']}]",False,"['Christopher Fleming', 'De-Liang Long', 'Nicola McMillan', 'Jacqueline Johnston', 'Nicolas Bovet', 'Vin Dhanak', 'Nikolaj Gadegaard', 'Paul Kögerler', 'Leroy Cronin', 'Malcolm Kadodwala']","Fleming, C., Long, D., McMillan, N. et al.

article,Structural engineering of nanoporous anodic aluminium oxide by pulse anodization of aluminium,"<p>Nanoporous anodic aluminium oxide has traditionally been made in one of two ways: mild anodization or hard anodization. The first method produces self-ordered pore structures, but it is slow and only works for a narrow range of processing conditions; the second method, which is widely used in the aluminium industry, is faster, but it produces films with disordered pore structures. Here we report a novel approach termed &#8220;pulse anodization&#8221; that combines the advantages of the mild and hard anodization processes. By designing the pulse sequences it is possible to control both the composition and pore structure of the anodic aluminium oxide films while maintaining high throughput.
