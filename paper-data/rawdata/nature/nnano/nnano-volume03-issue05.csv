letter,Large-area ultrathin films of reduced graphene oxide as a transparent and flexible electronic material,"<p>The integration of novel materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes and nanowires into devices has been challenging, but developments in transfer printing and solution-based methods now allow these materials to be incorporated into large-area electronics. Similar efforts are now being devoted to making the integration of graphene into devices technologically feasible. Here, we report a solution-based method that allows uniform and controllable deposition of reduced graphene oxide thin films with thicknesses ranging from a single monolayer to several layers over large areas. The opto-electronic properties can thus be tuned over several orders of magnitude, making them potentially useful for flexible and transparent semiconductors or semi-metals. The thinnest films exhibit graphene-like ambipolar transistor characteristics, whereas thicker films behave as graphite-like semi-metals. Collectively, our deposition method could represent a route for translating the interesting fundamental properties of graphene into technologically viable devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Goki Eda"", ""Giovanni Fanchini"", ""Manish Chhowalla""]","Eda, G., Fanchini, G. & Chhowalla, M.

In this approach the two stable phases of an excited harmonic oscillator provide the basis for logic operations. Computer architectures based on LC oscillators were developed for this approach, but high power consumption and difficulties with integration meant that the Parametron was rendered obsolete by the transistor. Here we propose an approach to mechanical logic based on nanoelectromechanical systems that is a variation on the Parametron architecture and, as a first step towards a possible nanomechanical computer, we demonstrate both bit storage and bit flip operations.</p>",[],False,"[""I.

letter,Self-regulation of photoinduced electron transfer by a molecular nonlinear transducer,"<p>Organisms must adapt to survive, necessitating regulation of molecular and subcellular processes. Green plant photosynthesis responds to potentially damaging light levels by downregulating the fraction of excitation energy that drives electron transfer. Achieving adaptive, self-regulating behaviour in synthetic molecules is a critical challenge that must be met if the promises of nanotechnology are to be realized. Here we report a molecular pentad consisting of two light-gathering antennas, a porphyrin electron donor, a fullerene electron acceptor and a photochromic control moiety. At low white-light levels, the molecule undergoes photoinduced electron transfer with a quantum yield of 82%. As the light intensity increases, photoisomerization of the photochrome leads to quenching of the porphyrin excited state, reducing the quantum yield to as low as 27%. This self-regulating molecule modifies its function according to the level of environmental light, mimicking the non-photochemical quenching mechanism for photoprotection found in plants.</p>",[],False,"[""Stephen D.

letter,Mass production and dynamic imaging of fluorescent nanodiamonds,"<p>Fluorescent nanodiamond is a new nanomaterial that possesses several useful properties, including good biocompatibility, excellent photostability and facile surface functionalizability. Moreover, when excited by a laser, defect centres within the nanodiamond emit photons that are capable of penetrating tissue, making them well suited for biological imaging applications. Here, we show that bright fluorescent nanodiamonds can be produced in large quantities by irradiating synthetic diamond nanocrystallites with helium ions. The fluorescence is sufficiently bright and stable to allow three-dimensional tracking of a single particle within the cell by means of either one- or two-photon-excited fluorescence microscopy. The excellent photophysical characteristics are maintained for particles as small as 25&#160;nm, suggesting that fluorescent nanodiamond is an ideal probe for long-term tracking and imaging in vivo, with good temporal and spatial resolution.</p>",[],False,"[""Yi-Ren Chang"", ""Hsu-Yang Lee"", ""Kowa Chen"", ""Chun-Chieh Chang"", ""Dung-Sheng Tsai"", ""Chi-Cheng Fu"", ""Tsong-Shin Lim"", ""Yan-Kai Tzeng"", ""Chia-Yi Fang"", ""Chau-Chung Han"", ""Huan-Cheng Chang"", ""Wunshain Fann""]","Chang, YR., Lee, HY., Chen, K. et al.

article,Integrated three-dimensional microelectromechanical devices from processable carbon nanotube wafers,"<p>In order to be useful as microelectromechanical devices, carbon nanotubes with well-controlled properties and orientations should be made at high density and be placed at predefined locations. We address this challenge by hierarchically assembling carbon nanotubes into closely packed and highly aligned three-dimensional wafer films from which a wide range of complex and three-dimensional nanotube structures were lithographically fabricated. These include carbon nanotube islands on substrates, suspended sheets and beams, and three-dimensional cantilevers, all of which exist as single cohesive units with useful mechanical and electrical properties. Every fabrication step is both parallel and scalable, which makes it easy to further integrate these structures into functional three-dimensional nanodevice systems. Our approach opens up new ways to make economical and scalable devices with unprecedented structural complexity and functionality.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuhei Hayamizu"", ""Takeo Yamada"", ""Kohei Mizuno"", ""Robert C.

article,Improved nanofabrication through guided transient liquefaction,"<p>A challenge in nanofabrication is to overcome the limitations of various fabrication methods, including defects, line-edge roughness and the minimum size for the feature linewidth. Here we demonstrate a new approach that can remove fabrication defects and improve nanostructures post-fabrication. This method, which we call self-perfection by liquefaction, can significantly reduce the line-edge roughness and, by using a flat plate to guide the process, increase the sidewall slope, flatten the top surface and narrow the width while increasing the height. The technique involves selectively melting nanostructures for a short period of time (hundreds of nanoseconds) while applying a set of boundary conditions to guide the flow of the molten material into the desired geometry before solidification. Using this method we reduced the 3&#963; line-edge roughness of 70-nm-wide chromium grating lines from 8.4&#160;nm to less than 1.5&#160;nm, which is well below the &#8216;red-zone limit&#8217; of 3&#160;nm discussed in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. We also reduced the width of a silicon line from 285&#160;nm to 175&#160;nm, while increasing its height from 50&#160;nm to 90&#160;nm. Self-perfection by liquefaction can also be extended to other metals and semiconductors, dielectrics and large-area wafers.</p>",[],False,"[""Stephen Y. Chou"", ""Qiangfei Xia""]","Chou, S., Xia, Q.

article,Label-free detection of DNA hybridization based on hydration-induced tension in nucleic acid films,"<p>The properties of water at the nanoscale are crucial in many areas of biology, but the confinement of water molecules in sub-nanometre channels in biological systems has received relatively little attention. Advances in nanotechnology make it possible to explore the role played by water molecules in living systems, potentially leading to the development of ultrasensitive biosensors. Here we show that the adsorption of water by a self-assembled monolayer of single-stranded DNA on a silicon microcantilever can be detected by measuring how the tension in the monolayer changes as a result of hydration. Our approach relies on the microcantilever bending by an amount that depends on the tension in the monolayer. In particular, we find that the tension changes dramatically when the monolayer interacts with either complementary or single mismatched single-stranded DNA targets. Our results suggest that the tension is mainly governed by hydration forces in the channels between the DNA molecules and could lead to the development of a label-free DNA biosensor that can detect single mutations. The technique provides sensitivity in the femtomolar range that is at least two orders of magnitude better than that obtained previously with label-free nanomechanical biosensors and with label-dependent microarrays.</p>",[],False,"[""Johann Mertens"", ""Celia Rogero"", ""Montserrat Calleja"", ""Daniel Ramos"", ""Jose Angel Mart\u00edn-Gago"", ""Carlos Briones"", ""Javier Tamayo""]","Mertens, J., Rogero, C., Calleja, M. et al.
