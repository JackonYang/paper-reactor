letter,Functionalized graphene sheets for polymer nanocomposites,"<p>Polymer-based composites were heralded in the 1960s as a new paradigm for materials. By dispersing strong, highly stiff fibres in a polymer matrix, high-performance lightweight composites could be developed and tailored to individual applications. Today we stand at a similar threshold in the realm of polymer nanocomposites with the promise of strong, durable, multifunctional materials with low nanofiller content. However, the cost of nanoparticles, their availability and the challenges that remain to achieve good dispersion pose significant obstacles to these goals. Here, we report the creation of polymer nanocomposites with functionalized graphene sheets, which overcome these obstacles and provide superb polymer&#8211;particle interactions. An unprecedented shift in glass transition temperature of over 40&#160;&#176;C is obtained for poly(acrylonitrile) at 1&#160;wt% functionalized graphene sheet, and with only 0.05&#160;wt% functionalized graphene sheet in poly(methyl methacrylate) there is an improvement of nearly 30&#160;&#176;C. Modulus, ultimate strength and thermal stability follow a similar trend, with values for functionalized graphene sheet&#8211; poly(methyl methacrylate) rivaling those for single-walled carbon nanotube&#8211;poly(methyl methacrylate) composites.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, 60208, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['T.

letter,Superwetting nanowire membranes for selective absorption,"<p>The construction of nanoporous membranes is of great technological importance for various applications, including catalyst supports, filters for biomolecule purification, environmental remediation and seawater desalination. A major challenge is the scalable fabrication of membranes with the desirable combination of good thermal stability, high selectivity and excellent recyclability. Here we present a self-assembly method for constructing thermally stable, free-standing nanowire membranes that exhibit controlled wetting behaviour ranging from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic. These membranes can selectively absorb oils up to 20 times the material's weight in preference to water, through a combination of superhydrophobicity and capillary action. Moreover, the nanowires that form the membrane structure can be re-suspended in solutions and subsequently re-form the original paper-like morphology over many cycles. Our results suggest an innovative material that should find practical applications in the removal of organics, particularly in the field of oil spill cleanup.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Jikang Yuan', '\xa0&\xa0Jing Kong']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Xiaogang Liu', ',\xa0Ozge Akbulut', '\xa0&\xa0Francesco Stellacci']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117543', 'authors': ['Xiaogang Liu']}, {'address': 'International Center for Young Scientists, National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, 305-0044, Ibaraki, Japan', 'authors': ['Junqing Hu']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Institute of Materials Science, University of Connecticut, Storrs, 06269-3060, Connecticut, USA', 'authors': ['Steven L.

letter,Atomically resolved mechanical response of individual metallofullerene molecules confined inside carbon nanotubes,"<p>The hollow core inside a carbon nanotube can be used to confine single molecules and it is now possible to image the movement of such molecules inside nanotubes. To date, however, it has not been possible to control this motion, nor to detect the forces moving the molecules, despite experimental and theoretical evidence suggesting that almost friction-free motion might be possible inside the nanotubes. Here, we report on precise measurements of the mechanical responses of individual metallofullerene molecules (Dy@C<sub>82</sub>) confined inside single-walled carbon nanotubes to the atom at the tip of an atomic force microscope operated in dynamic mode. Using three-dimensional force mapping with atomic resolution, we addressed the molecules from the exterior of the nanotube and measured their elastic and inelastic behaviour by simultaneously detecting the attractive forces and energy losses with three-dimensional, atomic-scale resolution.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Applied Physics and Microstructure Research Centre, University of Hamburg, Jungiusstraße 11, Hamburg, 20355, Germany', 'authors': ['Makoto Ashino', '\xa0&\xa0Roland Wiesendanger']}, {'address': 'Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Heisenbergstraße 1, Stuttgart, 70569, Germany', 'authors': ['Dirk Obergfell', ',\xa0Miro Haluška', '\xa0&\xa0Siegmar Roth']}, {'address': 'Micro- and NanoScale Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, PO Box 513, Eindhoven, 5600, MB, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Miro Haluška']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China', 'authors': ['Shihe Yang']}, {'address': 'School of Chemistry, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK', 'authors': ['Andrei N.

letter,A self-sustaining ultrahigh-frequency nanoelectromechanical oscillator,"<p>Sensors based on nanoelectromechanical systems vibrating at high and ultrahigh frequencies are capable of levels of performance that surpass those of larger sensors. Nanoelectromechanical devices have achieved unprecedented sensitivity in the detection of displacement, mass, force and charge. To date, these milestones have been achieved with passive devices that require external periodic or impulsive stimuli to excite them into resonance. Here, we demonstrate an autonomous and self-sustaining nanoelectromechanical oscillator that generates continuous ultrahigh-frequency signals when powered by a steady d.c. source. The frequency-determining element in the oscillator is a 428&#160;MHz nanoelectromechanical resonator that is embedded within a tunable electrical feedback network to generate active and stable self-oscillation. Our prototype nanoelectromechanical oscillator exhibits excellent frequency stability, linewidth narrowing and low phase noise performance. Such ultrahigh-frequency oscillators provide a comparatively simple means for implementing a wide variety of practical sensing applications. They also offer intriguing opportunities for nanomechanical frequency control, timing and synchronization.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Nanoscience Institute, MC 114-36, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, 91125, California, USA', 'authors': ['X.

letter,Impact of carbon nanotubes on the ingestion and digestion of bacteria by ciliated protozoa,"<p>Research on the toxicity of carbon nanotubes has focused on human health risks, and little is known about their impact on natural ecosystems. The ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila has been widely studied by ecotoxicologists because of its role in the regulation of microbial populations through the ingestion and digestion of bacteria, and because it is an important organism in wastewater treatment and an indicator of sewage effluent quality. Here we show that single-walled carbon nanotubes are internalized by T. thermophila, possibly allowing the nanotubes to move up the food chain. The internalization also causes the protozoa to aggregate, which impedes their ability to ingest and digest their prey bacteria species, although it might also be possible to use nanotubes to improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Parnian Ghafari', ',\xa0Xu Jin', ',\xa0Veronica Tsou', ',\xa0Himadri S.

letter,Trophic transfer of nanoparticles in a simplified invertebrate food web,"<p>The unique chemical and physical properties of engineered nanomaterials that make them attractive for numerous applications also contribute to their unexpected behaviour in the environment and biological systems. The potential environmental risks, including their impact on aquatic organisms, have been a central argument for regulating the growth of the nanotechnology sector. Here we show in a simplified food web that carboxylated and biotinylated quantum dots can be transferred to higher trophic organisms (rotifers) through dietary uptake of ciliated protozoans. Quantum dot accumulation from the surrounding environment (bioconcentration) was limited in the ciliates and no quantum dot enrichment (biomagnification) was observed in the rotifers. Our findings indicate that dietary uptake of nanomaterials should be considered for higher trophic aquatic organisms. However, limited bioconcentration and lack of biomagnification may impede the detection of nanomaterials in invertebrate species.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, 20901, Maryland, USA', 'authors': ['R.

article,Selection of carbon nanotubes with specific chiralities using helical assemblies of flavin mononucleotide,"<p>The chirality of single-walled carbon nanotubes affects many of their physical and electronic properties. Current production methods result in nanotubes of mixed chiralities, so facile extraction of specific chiralities of single-walled carbon nanotubes is an important step in their effective utilization. Here we show that the flavin mononucleotide, a common redox cofactor, wraps around single-walled carbon nanotubes in a helical pattern that imparts efficient individualization and chirality selection. The cooperative hydrogen bonding between adjacent flavin moieties results in the formation of a helical ribbon, which organizes around single-walled carbon nanotubes through concentric &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the flavin mononucleotide and the underlying graphene wall. The strength of the helical flavin mononucleotide assembly is strongly dependent on nanotube chirality. In the presence of a surfactant, the flavin mononucleotide assembly is disrupted and replaced without precipitation by a surfactant micelle. The significantly higher affinity of the flavin mononucleotide assembly for (8,6)-single-walled carbon nanotubes results in an 85% chirality enrichment from a nanotube sample with broad diameter distribution.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nanomaterials Optoelectronics Laboratory (NOEL), Polymer Program, University of Connecticut, Connecticut, Storrs, 06269-3136, USA', 'authors': ['Sang-Yong Ju', ',\xa0Jonathan Doll', '\xa0&\xa0Fotios Papadimitrakopoulos']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Institute of Materials Science, University of Connecticut, Storrs, 06269-3136, Connecticut, USA', 'authors': ['Ity Sharma', '\xa0&\xa0Fotios Papadimitrakopoulos']}]",False,"['Sang-Yong Ju', 'Jonathan Doll', 'Ity Sharma', 'Fotios Papadimitrakopoulos']","Ju, S., Doll, J., Sharma, I. et al.

article,Computer simulation study of fullerene translocation through lipid membranes,"<p>Recent toxicology studies suggest that nanosized aggregates of fullerene molecules can enter cells and alter their functions, and also cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier. However, the mechanisms by which fullerenes penetrate and disrupt cell membranes are still poorly understood. Here we use computer simulations to explore the translocation of fullerene clusters through a model lipid membrane and the effect of high fullerene concentrations on membrane properties. The fullerene molecules rapidly aggregate in water but disaggregate after entering the membrane interior. The permeation of a solid-like fullerene aggregate into the lipid bilayer is thermodynamically favoured and occurs on the microsecond timescale. High concentrations of fullerene induce changes in the structural and elastic properties of the lipid bilayer, but these are not large enough to mechanically damage the membrane. Our results suggest that mechanical damage is an unlikely mechanism for membrane disruption and fullerene toxicity.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, T2N 1N4, Alberta, Canada', 'authors': ['Jirasak Wong-Ekkabut', ',\xa0Svetlana Baoukina', ',\xa0D.
