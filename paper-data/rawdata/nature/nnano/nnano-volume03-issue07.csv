letter,Tailoring the atomic structure of graphene nanoribbons by scanning tunnelling microscope lithography,"<p>The practical realization of nanoscale electronics faces two major challenges: the precise engineering of the building blocks and their assembly into functional circuits. In spite of the exceptional electronic properties of carbon nanotubes, only basic demonstration devices have been realized that require time-consuming processes. This is mainly due to a lack of selective growth and reliable assembly processes for nanotubes. However, graphene offers an attractive alternative. Here we report the patterning of graphene nanoribbons and bent junctions with nanometre-precision, well-defined widths and predetermined crystallographic orientations, allowing us to fully engineer their electronic structure using scanning tunnelling microscope lithography. The atomic structure and electronic properties of the ribbons have been investigated by scanning tunnelling microscopy and tunnelling spectroscopy measurements. Opening of confinement gaps up to 0.5&#160;eV, enabling room-temperature operation of graphene nanoribbon-based devices, is reported. This method avoids the difficulties of assembling nanoscale components and may prove useful in the realization of complete integrated circuits, operating as room-temperature ballistic electronic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Institute for Technical Physics and Materials Science, Budapest, H-1525, Hungary', 'authors': ['Levente Tapasztó', ',\xa0Gergely Dobrik', '\xa0&\xa0László P.

letter,Individually addressable epitaxial ferroelectric nanocapacitor arrays with near Tb inch−2 density,"<p>Ferroelectric materials have emerged in recent years as an alternative to magnetic and dielectric materials for nonvolatile data-storage applications. Lithography is widely used to reduce the size of data-storage elements in ultrahigh-density memory devices. However, ferroelectric materials tend to be oxides with complex structures that are easily damaged by existing lithographic techniques, so an alternative approach is needed to fabricate ultrahigh-density ferroelectric memories. Here we report a high-temperature deposition process that can fabricate arrays of individually addressable metal/ferroelectric/metal nanocapacitors with a density of 176&#160;Gb&#160;inch<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. The use of an ultrathin anodic alumina membrane as a lift-off mask makes it possible to deposit the memory elements at temperatures as high as 650&#160;&#176;C, which results in excellent ferroelectric properties.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics, Weinberg 2, Halle, D-06120, Germany', 'authors': ['Woo Lee', ',\xa0Andriy Lotnyk', ',\xa0Markus Andreas Schubert', ',\xa0Stephan Senz', ',\xa0Marin Alexe', ',\xa0Dietrich Hesse', '\xa0&\xa0Ulrich Gösele']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, San 31, Hyoja-dong, Pohang, 790-784, Korea', 'authors': ['Hee Han', '\xa0&\xa0Sunggi Baik']}, {'address': 'Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Yuseong, Daejon, 305-340, Korea', 'authors': ['Woo Lee']}]",False,"['Woo Lee', 'Hee Han', 'Andriy Lotnyk', 'Markus Andreas Schubert', 'Stephan Senz', 'Marin Alexe', 'Dietrich Hesse', 'Sunggi Baik', 'Ulrich Gösele']","Lee, W., Han, H., Lotnyk, A. et al.

letter,Prediction of very large values of magnetoresistance in a graphene nanoribbon device,"<p>Graphene has emerged as a versatile material with outstanding electronic properties that could prove useful in many device applications. Recently, the demonstration of spin injection into graphene and the observation of long spin relaxation times and lengths have suggested that graphene could play a role in &#8216;spintronic&#8217; devices that manipulate electron spin rather than charge. In particular it has been found that zigzag graphene nanoribbons have magnetic (or spin) states at their edges, and that these states can be either antiparallel or parallel. Here we report the results of first-principles simulations that predict that spin-valve devices based on graphene nanoribbons will exhibit magnetoresistance values that are thousands of times higher than previously reported experimental values. These remarkable values can be linked to the unique symmetry of the band structure in the nanoribbons. We also show that it is possible to manipulate the band structure of the nanoribbons to generate highly spin-polarized currents.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Center for Superfunctional Materials, Pohang University of Science and Technology, San 31, Hyojadong, Namgu, 790-784, Pohang, Korea', 'authors': ['Woo Youn Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Kwang S.

letter,Subwavelength direct-write nanopatterning using optically trapped microspheres,"<p>A number of non-lithographic techniques are now available for processing materials on the nanoscale, including optical techniques capable of producing features that are much smaller than the wavelength of light used. However, these techniques can be limited in speed, ease of use, cost of implementation, or the range of patterns they can write. Here we report how Bessel beam laser trapping of microspheres near surfaces can be used to enable near-field direct-write subwavelength nanopatterning. Using the microsphere as an objective lens to focus the processing laser, we demonstrate arbitrary patterns and individual features with minimum sizes of &#8764;100 nm (which is less than one-third the processing wavelength) and a positioning accuracy better than 40 nm in aqueous and chemical environments. Submicron spacing is maintained between the near-field objective and the substrate without active feedback control. If implemented with an array of optical traps, this approach could lead to a high-throughput probe-based method for patterning surfaces with subwavelength features.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department, Engineering Quadrangle, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA', 'authors': ['Euan Mcleod', '\xa0&\xa0Craig B.

letter,Self-assembled DNA nanostructures for distance-dependent multivalent ligand–protein binding,"<p>An important goal of nanotechnology is to assemble multiple molecules while controlling the spacing between them. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of multivalency, which is characterized by simultaneous binding of multiple ligands on one biological entity to multiple receptors on another. Various approaches have been developed to engineer multivalency by linking multiple ligands together. However, the effects of well-controlled inter-ligand distances on multivalency are less well understood. Recent progress in self-assembling DNA nanostructures with spatial and sequence addressability has made deterministic positioning of different molecular species possible. Here we show that distance-dependent multivalent binding effects can be systematically investigated by incorporating multiple-affinity ligands into DNA nanostructures with precise nanometre spatial control. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate direct visualization of high-affinity bivalent ligands being used as pincers to capture and display protein molecules on a nanoarray. These results illustrate the potential of using designer DNA nanoscaffolds to engineer more complex and interactive biomolecular networks.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Centre for Single Molecule Biophysics at the Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, 85287, Arizona, USA', 'authors': ['Sherri Rinker', ',\xa0Yonggang Ke', ',\xa0Yan Liu', ',\xa0Rahul Chhabra', '\xa0&\xa0Hao Yan']}]",False,"['Sherri Rinker', 'Yonggang Ke', 'Yan Liu', 'Rahul Chhabra', 'Hao Yan']","Rinker, S., Ke, Y., Liu, Y. et al.

letter,Carbon nanotubes introduced into the abdominal cavity of mice show asbestos-like pathogenicity in a pilot study,"<p>Carbon nanotubes have distinctive characteristics, but their needle-like fibre shape has been compared to asbestos, raising concerns that widespread use of carbon nanotubes may lead to mesothelioma, cancer of the lining of the lungs caused by exposure to asbestos. Here we show that exposing the mesothelial lining of the body cavity of mice, as a surrogate for the mesothelial lining of the chest cavity, to long multiwalled carbon nanotubes results in asbestos-like, length-dependent, pathogenic behaviour. This includes inflammation and the formation of lesions known as granulomas. This is of considerable importance, because research and business communities continue to invest heavily in carbon nanotubes for a wide range of products under the assumption that they are no more hazardous than graphite. Our results suggest the need for further research and great caution before introducing such products into the market if long-term harm is to be avoided.</p>",,"[{'address': ""MRC/University of Edinburgh, Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, UK"", 'authors': ['Craig A.

article,Memristive switching mechanism for metal/oxide/metal nanodevices,"<p>Nanoscale metal/oxide/metal switches have the potential to transform the market for nonvolatile memory and could lead to novel forms of computing. However, progress has been delayed by difficulties in understanding and controlling the coupled electronic and ionic phenomena that dominate the behaviour of nanoscale oxide devices. An analytic theory of the &#8216;memristor&#8217; (memory-resistor) was first developed from fundamental symmetry arguments in 1971, and we recently showed that memristor behaviour can naturally explain such coupled electron&#8211;ion dynamics. Here we provide experimental evidence to support this general model of memristive electrical switching in oxide systems. We have built micro- and nanoscale TiO<sub>2</sub> junction devices with platinum electrodes that exhibit fast bipolar nonvolatile switching. We demonstrate that switching involves changes to the electronic barrier at the Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface due to the drift of positively charged oxygen vacancies under an applied electric field. Vacancy drift towards the interface creates conducting channels that shunt, or short-circuit, the electronic barrier to switch ON. The drift of vacancies away from the interface annilihilates such channels, recovering the electronic barrier to switch OFF. Using this model we have built TiO<sub>2</sub> crosspoints with engineered oxygen vacancy profiles that predictively control the switching polarity and conductance.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, 94304, California, USA', 'authors': ['J.

The carbon nanotube coating enhanced both recording and electrical stimulation of neurons in culture, rats and monkeys by decreasing the electrode impedance and increasing charge transfer.
