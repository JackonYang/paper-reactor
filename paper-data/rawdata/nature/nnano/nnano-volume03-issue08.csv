review article,Harnessing biological motors to engineer systems for nanoscale transport and assembly,"<p>Living systems use biological nanomotors to build life's essential molecules&#8212;such as DNA and proteins&#8212;as well as to transport cargo inside cells with both spatial and temporal precision. Each motor is highly specialized and carries out a distinct function within the cell. Some have even evolved sophisticated mechanisms to ensure quality control during nanomanufacturing processes, whether to correct errors in biosynthesis or to detect and permit the repair of damaged transport highways. In general, these nanomotors consume chemical energy in order to undergo a series of shape changes that let them interact sequentially with other molecules. Here we review some of the many tasks that biomotors perform and analyse their underlying design principles from an engineering perspective. We also discuss experiments and strategies to integrate biomotors into synthetic environments for applications such as sensing, transport and assembly.</p>",[],False,"[""Anita Goel"", ""Viola Vogel""]","Goel, A., Vogel, V.

letter,Formation of chiral branched nanowires by the Eshelby Twist,"<p>Manipulating the morphology of inorganic nanostructures, such as their chirality and branching structure, has been actively pursued as a means of controlling their electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Notable examples of chiral inorganic nanostructures include carbon nanotubes, gold multishell nanowires, mesoporous nanowires and helical nanowires. Branched nanostructures have also been studied and been shown to have interesting properties for energy harvesting and nanoelectronics. Combining both chiral and branching motifs into nanostructures might provide new materials properties. Here we show a chiral branched PbSe nanowire structure, which is formed by a vapour&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid branching from a central nanowire with an axial screw dislocation. The chirality is caused by the elastic strain of the axial screw dislocation, which produces a corresponding Eshelby Twist in the nanowires. In addition to opening up new opportunities for tailoring the properties of nanomaterials, these chiral branched nanowires also provide a direct visualization of the Eshelby Twist.</p>",[],False,"[""Jia Zhu"", ""Hailin Peng"", ""A.

letter,Ultrasonically driven nanomechanical single-electron shuttle,"<p>The single-electron transistor is the fastest and most sensitive electrometer available today. Single-electron pumps and turnstiles are also being explored as part of the global effort to redefine the ampere in terms of the fundamental physical constants. However, the possibility of electrons tunnelling coherently through these devices, a phenomenon known as co-tunnelling, imposes a fundamental limit on device performance. It has been predicted that it should be possible to completely suppress co-tunnelling in mechanical versions of the single-electron transistor, which would allow mechanical devices to outperform conventional single-electron transistors in many applications. However, the mechanical devices developed so far are fundamentally limited by unwanted interactions with the electrical mechanisms that are used to excite the devices. Here we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by using ultrasonic waves rather than electrical currents as the excitation mechanism, which we demonstrate at low temperatures. This is a significant step towards the development of high-performance devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel R. Koenig"", ""Eva M. Weig"", ""Jorg P. Kotthaus""]","Koenig, D., Weig, E. & Kotthaus, J.

letter,Contact and edge effects in graphene devices,"<p>Electrical transport studies on graphene have been focused mainly on the linear dispersion region around the Fermi level and, in particular, on the effects associated with the quasiparticles in graphene behaving as relativistic particles known as Dirac fermions. However, some theoretical work has suggested that several features of electron transport in graphene are better described by conventional semiconductor physics. Here we use scanning photocurrent microscopy to explore the impact of electrical contacts and sheet edges on charge transport through graphene devices. The photocurrent distribution reveals the presence of potential steps that act as transport barriers at the metal contacts. Modulations in the electrical potential within the graphene sheets are also observed. Moreover, we find that the transition from the p- to n-type regime induced by electrostatic gating does not occur homogeneously within the sheets. Instead, at low carrier densities we observe the formation of p-type conducting edges surrounding a central n-type channel.</p>",[],False,"[""Eduardo J. H.

letter,Approaching ballistic transport in suspended graphene,"<p>The discovery of graphene raises the prospect of a new class of nanoelectronic devices based on the extraordinary physical properties of this one-atom-thick layer of carbon. Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for carrier densities below 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>9</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a substrate, the conductivity of suspended graphene at the Dirac point is strongly dependent on temperature and approaches ballistic values at liquid helium temperatures. At higher temperatures, above 100&#160;K, we observe the onset of thermally induced long-range scattering.</p>",[],False,"[""Xu Du"", ""Ivan Skachko"", ""Anthony Barker"", ""Eva Y.

letter,Ultrasensitive hot-electron nanobolometers for terahertz astrophysics,"<p>The submillimetre or terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum contains approximately half of the total luminosity of the Universe and 98% of all the photons emitted since the Big Bang. This radiation is strongly absorbed in the Earth's atmosphere, so space-based terahertz telescopes are crucial for exploring the evolution of the Universe. Thermal emission from the primary mirrors in these telescopes can be reduced below the level of the cosmic background by active cooling, which expands the range of faint objects that can be observed. However, it will also be necessary to develop bolometers&#8212;devices for measuring the energy of electromagnetic radiation&#8212;with sensitivities that are at least two orders of magnitude better than the present state of the art. To achieve this sensitivity without sacrificing operating speed, two conditions are required. First, the bolometer should be exceptionally well thermally isolated from the environment; second, its heat capacity should be sufficiently small. Here we demonstrate that these goals can be achieved by building a superconducting hot-electron nanobolometer. Its design eliminates the energy exchange between hot electrons and the leads by blocking electron outdiffusion and photon emission. The thermal conductance between hot electrons and the thermal bath, controlled by electron&#8211;phonon interactions, becomes very small at low temperatures (&#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>&#160;W&#160;K<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 40 mK). These devices, with a heat capacity of &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;19</sup>&#160;J&#160;K<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, are sufficiently sensitive to detect single terahertz photons in submillimetre astronomy and other applications based on quantum calorimetry and photon counting.</p>",[],False,"[""Jian Wei"", ""David Olaya"", ""Boris S.

letter,Imaging nanoparticles in cells by nanomechanical holography,"<p>Nanomaterials have potential medical applications, for example in the area of drug delivery, and their possible adverse effects and cytotoxicity are curently receiving attention. Inhalation of nanoparticles is of great concern, because nanoparticles can be easily aerosolized. Imaging techniques that can visualize local populations of nanoparticles at nanometre resolution within the structures of cells are therefore important. Here we show that cells obtained from mice exposed to single-walled carbon nanohorns can be probed using a scanning probe microscopy technique called scanning near field ultrasonic holography. The nanohorns were observed inside the cells, and this was further confirmed using micro Raman spectroscopy. Scanning near field ultrasonic holography is a useful technique for probing the interactions of engineered nanomaterials in biological systems, which will greatly benefit areas in drug delivery and nanotoxicology.</p>",[],False,"[""Laurene Tetard"", ""Ali Passian"", ""Katherine T.

letter,Formation and enhanced biocidal activity of water-dispersable organic nanoparticles,"<p>Water-insoluble organic compounds are often used in aqueous environments in various pharmaceutical and consumer products. To overcome insolubility, the particles are dispersed in a medium during product formation, but large particles that are formed may affect product performance and safety. Many techniques have been used to produce nanodispersions&#8212;dispersions with nanometre-scale dimensions&#8212;that have properties similar to solutions. However, making nanodispersions requires complex processing, and it is difficult to achieve stability over long periods. Here we report a generic method for producing organic nanoparticles with a combination of modified emulsion-templating and freeze-drying. The dry powder composites formed using this method are highly porous, stable and form nanodispersions upon simple addition of water.

letter,Engineered elastomeric proteins with dual elasticity can be controlled by a molecular regulator,"<p>Elastomeric proteins are molecular springs that confer excellent mechanical properties to many biological tissues and biomaterials. Depending on the role performed by the tissue or biomaterial, elastomeric proteins can behave as molecular springs or shock absorbers. Here we combine single-molecule atomic force microscopy and protein engineering techniques to create elastomeric proteins that can switch between two distinct types of mechanical behaviour in response to the binding of a molecular regulator. The proteins are mechanically labile by design and behave as entropic springs with an elasticity that is governed by their configurational entropy. However, when a molecular regulator binds to the protein, it switches into a mechanically stable state and can act as a shock absorber. These engineered proteins effectively mimic and combine the two extreme forms of elastic behaviour found in natural elastomeric proteins, and thus represent a new type of smart nanomaterial that will find potential applications in nanomechanics and material sciences.</p>",[],False,"[""Yi Cao"", ""Hongbin Li""]","Cao, Y., Li, H.
