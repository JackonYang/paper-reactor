letter,An atomic-resolution nanomechanical mass sensor,"<p>Mechanical resonators are widely used as inertial balances to detect small quantities of adsorbed mass through shifts in oscillation frequency. Advances in lithography and materials synthesis have enabled the fabrication of nanoscale mechanical resonators, which have been operated as precision force, position and mass sensors. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature, carbon-nanotube-based nanomechanical resonator with atomic mass resolution. This device is essentially a mass spectrometer with a mass sensitivity of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;25</sup>&#160;kg&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> or, equivalently, 0.40&#160;gold atoms Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>. Using this extreme mass sensitivity, we observe atomic mass shot noise, which is analogous to the electronic shot noise measured in many semiconductor experiments. Unlike traditional mass spectrometers, nanomechanical mass spectrometers do not require the potentially destructive ionization of the test sample, are more sensitive to large molecules, and could eventually be incorporated on a chip.</p>",[],False,"[""K.

letter,Highly conducting graphene sheets and Langmuir–Blodgett films,"<p>Graphene is an intriguing material with properties that are distinct from those of other graphitic systems. The first samples of pristine graphene were obtained by &#8216;peeling off&#8217; and epitaxial growth. Recently, the chemical reduction of graphite oxide was used to produce covalently functionalized single-layer graphene oxide. However, chemical approaches for the large-scale production of highly conducting graphene sheets remain elusive. Here, we report that the exfoliation&#8211;reintercalation&#8211;expansion of graphite can produce high-quality single-layer graphene sheets stably suspended in organic solvents. The graphene sheets exhibit high electrical conductance at room and cryogenic temperatures. Large amounts of graphene sheets in organic solvents are made into large transparent conducting films by Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett assembly in a layer-by-layer manner. The chemically derived, high-quality graphene sheets could lead to future scalable graphene devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaolin Li"", ""Guangyu Zhang"", ""Xuedong Bai"", ""Xiaoming Sun"", ""Xinran Wang"", ""Enge Wang"", ""Hongjie Dai""]","Li, X., Zhang, G., Bai, X. et al.

letter,Nanoparticle-assisted high photoconductive gain in composites of polymer and fullerene,"<p>Polymer&#8211;inorganic nanocrystal composites offer an attractive means to combine the merits of organic and inorganic materials into novel electronic and photonic systems. However, many applications of these composites are limited by the solubility and distribution of the nanocrystals in the polymer matrices. Here we show that blending CdTe nanoparticles into a polymer&#8211;fullerene matrix followed by solvent annealing can achieve high photoconductive gain under low applied voltages. The surface capping ligand renders the nanoparticles highly soluble in the polymer blend, thereby enabling high CdTe loadings. An external quantum efficiency as high as &#8764;8,000% at 350 nm was achieved at &#8722;4.5 V. Hole-dominant devices coupled with atomic force microscopy images show a higher concentration of nanoparticles near the cathode&#8211;polymer interface. The nanoparticles and trapped electrons assist hole injection into the polymer under reverse bias, contributing to efficiency values in excess of 100%.</p>",[],False,"[""Hsiang-Yu Chen"", ""Michael K.

letter,Control of enhanced Raman scattering using a DNA-based assembly process of dye-coded nanoparticles,"<p>Enhanced Raman scattering from metal surfaces has been investigated for over 30 years. Silver surfaces are known to produce a large effect, and this can be maximized by producing a roughened surface, which can be achieved by the aggregation of silver nanoparticles. However, an approach to control this aggregation, in particular through the interaction of biological molecules such as DNA, has not been reported. Here we show the selective turning on of the surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering effect on dye-coded, DNA-functionalized, silver nanoparticles through a target-dependent, sequence-specific DNA hybridization assembly that exploits the electromagnetic enhancement mechanism for the scattering. Dye-coded nanoparticles that do not undergo hybridization experience no enhancement and hence do not give surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering. This is due to the massive difference in enhancement from nanoparticle assemblies compared with individual nanoparticles. The electromagnetic enhancement is the dominant effect and, coupled with an understanding of the surface chemistry, allows surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering nanosensors to be designed based on a natural biological recognition process.</p>",[],False,"[""Duncan Graham"", ""David G.

letter,Quantum-dot-assisted characterization of microtubule rotations during cargo transport,"<p>Owing to their wide spectrum of in vivo functions, motor proteins, such as kinesin-1, show great potential for application as nanomachines in engineered environments. When attached to a substrate surface, these motors are envisioned to shuttle cargo that is bound to reconstituted microtubules&#8212;one component of the cell cytoskeleton&#8212;from one location to another. One potentially serious problem for such applications is, however, the rotation of the microtubules around their longitudinal axis. Here we explore this issue by labelling the gliding microtubules with quantum dots to simultaneously follow their sinusoidal side-to-side and up-and-down motion in three dimensions with nanometre accuracy. Microtubule rotation, which originates from the kinesin moving along the individual protofilaments of the microtubule, was not impeded by the quantum dots. However, pick-up of large cargo inhibited the rotation but did not affect the velocity of microtubule gliding. Our data show that kinesin-driven microtubules make flexible, responsive and effective molecular shuttles for nanotransport applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Bert Nitzsche"", ""Felix Ruhnow"", ""Stefan Diez""]","Nitzsche, B., Ruhnow, F. & Diez, S.

letter,Carbon nanotubes as photoacoustic molecular imaging agents in living mice,"<p>Photoacoustic imaging of living subjects offers higher spatial resolution and allows deeper tissues to be imaged compared with most optical imaging techniques. As many diseases do not exhibit a natural photoacoustic contrast, especially in their early stages, it is necessary to administer a photoacoustic contrast agent. A number of contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging have been suggested previously, but most were not shown to target a diseased site in living subjects. Here we show that single-walled carbon nanotubes conjugated with cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides can be used as a contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging of tumours. Intravenous administration of these targeted nanotubes to mice bearing tumours showed eight times greater photoacoustic signal in the tumour than mice injected with non-targeted nanotubes. These results were verified ex vivo using Raman microscopy. Photoacoustic imaging of targeted single-walled carbon nanotubes may contribute to non-invasive cancer imaging and monitoring of nanotherapeutics in living subjects.</p>",[],False,"[""Adam De La Zerda"", ""Cristina Zavaleta"", ""Shay Keren"", ""Srikant Vaithilingam"", ""Sunil Bodapati"", ""Zhuang Liu"", ""Jelena Levi"", ""Bryan R.

article,High-yield production of graphene by liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite,"<p>Fully exploiting the properties of graphene will require a method for the mass production of this remarkable material. Two main routes are possible: large-scale growth or large-scale exfoliation. Here, we demonstrate graphene dispersions with concentrations up to &#8764;0.01 mg ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, produced by dispersion and exfoliation of graphite in organic solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone. This is possible because the energy required to exfoliate graphene is balanced by the solvent&#8211;graphene interaction for solvents whose surface energies match that of graphene. We confirm the presence of individual graphene sheets by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. Our method results in a monolayer yield of &#8764;1 wt%, which could potentially be improved to 7&#8211;12 wt% with further processing. The absence of defects or oxides is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron, infrared and Raman spectroscopies. We are able to produce semi-transparent conducting films and conducting composites.

article,Molecular junctions based on aromatic coupling,"<p>If individual molecules are to be used as building blocks for electronic devices, it will be essential to understand charge transport at the level of single molecules. Most existing experiments rely on the synthesis of functional rod-like molecules with chemical linker groups at both ends to provide strong, covalent anchoring to the source and drain contacts. This approach has proved very successful, providing quantitative measures of single-molecule conductance, and demonstrating rectification and switching at the single-molecule level. However, the influence of intermolecular interactions on the formation and operation of molecular junctions has been overlooked. Here we report the use of oligo-phenylene ethynylene molecules as a model system, and establish that molecular junctions can still form when one of the chemical linker groups is displaced or even fully removed. Our results demonstrate that aromatic &#960;&#8722;&#960; coupling between adjacent molecules is efficient enough to allow for the controlled formation of molecular bridges between nearby electrodes.</p>",[],False,"[""Songmei Wu"", ""Maria Teresa Gonz\u00e1lez"", ""Roman Huber"", ""Sergio Grunder"", ""Marcel Mayor"", ""Christian Sch\u00f6nenberger"", ""Michel Calame""]","Wu, S., González, M., Huber, R. et al.
