letter,Borosilicate nanoparticles prepared by exothermic phase separation,"<p>Nanoparticles play an important role in chemical and biological sciences due to their ability to bind and concentrate many molecules on their surface. Polymers and silica are widely used to make nanoparticles, but efforts to make nanoparticles from borosilicate glass&#8212;which exhibits high tolerance to chemicals and solvents, combined with excellent mechanical and thermal stability&#8212;have proved unsuccessful. Here we show that borosilicate nanoparticles (100&#8211;500&#160;nm in size) can be synthesized by simply mixing a silicon&#8211;boron binary oxide solution, prepared using non-aqueous organic solvents, with water. This induces a vigorous exothermic phase separation in which borosilicate nanoparticles burst out of a silica phase. In addition to potential applications in the life sciences, monodisperse borosilicate particles could also have applications in the production of photonic bandgap devices with high optical contrast, contrast agents for ultrasonic microscopy or chemical filtration membranes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory of Microsystems, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Virendra K.

letter,Imaging the passage of a single hydrocarbon chain through a nanopore,"<p>Molecular transport through nanoscale pores in films, membranes and wall structures is of fundamental importance in a number of physical, chemical and biological processes. However, there is a lack of experimental methods that can obtain information on the structure and orientation of the molecules as they pass through the pore, and their interactions with the pore during passage. Imaging with a transmission electron microscope is a powerful method for studying structural changes in single molecules as they move and for imaging molecules confined inside carbon nanotubes. Here, we report that such imaging can be used to observe the structure and orientation of a hydrocarbon chain as it passes through nanoscale defects in the walls of a single-walled carbon nanotube to the vacuum outside, and also to study the interactions between the chain and the nanopore. Based on experiments at 293&#160;K and 4&#160;K we conclude that the major energy source for the molecular motions observed at 4&#160;K is the electron beam used for the imaging.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO), Nakamura Functional Carbon Cluster Project, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan', 'authors': ['Masanori Koshino', '\xa0&\xa0Eiichi Nakamura']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan', 'authors': ['Niclas Solin', ',\xa0Takatsugu Tanaka', ',\xa0Hiroyuki Isobe', '\xa0&\xa0Eiichi Nakamura']}]",False,"['Masanori Koshino', 'Niclas Solin', 'Takatsugu Tanaka', 'Hiroyuki Isobe', 'Eiichi Nakamura']","Koshino, M., Solin, N., Tanaka, T. et al.

letter,Direct observation of chemical reactions on single gold nanocrystals using surface plasmon spectroscopy,"<p>Heterogeneous catalysts have been pivotal to the development of the modern chemical industry and are essential for catalysing many industrial reactions. However, reaction rates are different for every individual catalyst particle and depend upon each particle's morphology and size, crystal structure and composition. Measuring the rates of reaction on single nanocrystals will enable the role of catalyst structure to be quantified. Here, using surface plasmon spectroscopy, we have directly observed the kinetics of atomic deposition onto a single gold nanocrystal and also monitored electron injection and extraction during a redox reaction involving the oxidation of ascorbic acid on a gold nanocrystal surface. These results constitute the first direct measurement of the rates of redox catalysis on single nanocrystals.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Chemistry & Bio21 Institute, University of Melbourne, Parkville, 3010, Vic, Australia', 'authors': ['Carolina Novo', ',\xa0Alison M.

letter,CMOS-compatible fabrication of room-temperature single-electron devices,"<p>Devices in which the transport and storage of single electrons are systematically controlled could lead to a new generation of nanoscale devices and sensors. The attractive features of these devices include operation at extremely low power, scalability to the sub-nanometre regime and extremely high charge sensitivity. However, the fabrication of single-electron devices requires nanoscale geometrical control, which has limited their fabrication to small numbers of devices at a time, significantly restricting their implementation in practical devices. Here we report the parallel fabrication of single-electron devices, which results in multiple, individually addressable, single-electron devices that operate at room temperature. This was made possible using CMOS fabrication technology and implementing self-alignment of the source and drain electrodes, which are vertically separated by thin dielectric films. We demonstrate clear Coulomb staircase/blockade and Coulomb oscillations at room temperature and also at low temperatures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, 76019, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Vishva Ray', ',\xa0Ramkumar Subramanian', ',\xa0Pradeep Bhadrachalam', ',\xa0Liang-Chieh Ma', ',\xa0Choong-Un Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Seong Jin Koh']}]",False,"['Vishva Ray', 'Ramkumar Subramanian', 'Pradeep Bhadrachalam', 'Liang-Chieh Ma', 'Choong-Un Kim', 'Seong Jin Koh']","Ray, V., Subramanian, R., Bhadrachalam, P. et al.

letter,"A microcavity-controlled, current-driven, on-chip nanotube emitter at infrared wavelengths","<p>Recent studies of the optical properties of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes suggest that these truly nanometre-scale systems have a promising future in nanophotonics, in addition to their well-known potential in electronics. Semiconducting single-walled nanotubes have a direct, diameter-dependent bandgap and can be excited readily by current injection, which makes them attractive as nano-emitters. The electroluminescence is spectrally broad, spatially non-directional, and the radiative yield is low. Here we report the monolithic integration of a single, electrically excited, semiconducting nanotube transistor with a planar &#955;/2 microcavity, thus taking an important first step in the development of nanotube-based nanophotonic devices. The spectral full-width at half-maximum of the emission is reduced from &#8764;300 to &#8764;40 nm at a cavity resonance of 1.75 &#181;m, and the emission becomes highly directional. The maximum enhancement of the radiative rate is estimated to be 4.

letter,Patterning of light-emitting conjugated polymer nanofibres,"<p>Organic materials have revolutionized optoelectronics by their processability, flexibility and low cost, with application to light-emitting devices for full-colour screens, solar cells and lasers. Some low-dimensional organic semiconductor structures exhibit properties resembling those of inorganics, such as polarized emission and enhanced electroluminescence. One-dimensional metallic, III&#8211;V and II&#8211;VI nanostructures have also been the subject of intense investigation as building blocks for nanoelectronics and photonics. Given that one-dimensional polymer nanostructures, such as polymer nanofibres, are compatible with sub-micrometre patterning capability and electromagnetic confinement within subwavelength volumes, they can offer the benefits of organic light sources to nanoscale optics. Here we report on the optical properties of fully conjugated, electrospun polymer nanofibres. We assess their waveguiding performance and emission tuneability in the whole visible range. We demonstrate the enhancement of the fibre forward emission through imprinting periodic nanostructures using room-temperature nanoimprint lithography, and investigate the angular dispersion of differently polarized emitted light.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Italian Institute of Technology, Research Unit at NNL, National Nanotechnology Laboratory of INFM-CNR, via Arnesano, Lecce, I-73100, Italy', 'authors': ['Francesca Di Benedetto', ',\xa0Andrea Camposeo', ',\xa0Stefano Pagliara', ',\xa0Elisa Mele', ',\xa0Luana Persano', ',\xa0Ripalta Stabile', ',\xa0Roberto Cingolani', '\xa0&\xa0Dario Pisignano']}, {'address': 'Scuola Superiore ISUFI, Università del Salento, via Arnesano, Lecce, I-73100, Italy', 'authors': ['Stefano Pagliara', ',\xa0Ripalta Stabile', '\xa0&\xa0Dario Pisignano']}]",False,"['Francesca Di Benedetto', 'Andrea Camposeo', 'Stefano Pagliara', 'Elisa Mele', 'Luana Persano', 'Ripalta Stabile', 'Roberto Cingolani', 'Dario Pisignano']","Di Benedetto, F., Camposeo, A., Pagliara, S. et al.

letter,Coupling ion channels to receptors for biomolecule sensing,"<p>Nanoscale electrical biosensors are promising tools for diagnostics and high-throughput screening systems. The electrical signal allows label-free assays with a high signal-to-noise ratio and fast real-time measurements. The challenge in developing such biosensors lies in functionally connecting a molecule detector to an electrical switch. Advances in this field have relied on synthetic ion-conducting pores and modified ion channels that are not yet suitable for biomolecule screening. Here we report the design and characterization of a novel bioelectric-sensing platform engineered by coupling an ion channel, which serves as the electrical probe, to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell. These ion-channel-coupled receptors may potentially detect a wide range of ligands recognized by natural or altered GPCRs, which are known to be major pharmaceutical targets. This could form a unique platform for label-free drug screening.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire des Protéines Membranaires, Institut de Biologie Structurale (CEA, CNRS, UJF), 41 rue Jules Horowitz, Grenoble, 38027, France', 'authors': ['Christophe J.

article,Measurements of near-ultimate strength for multiwalled carbon nanotubes and irradiation-induced crosslinking improvements,"<p>The excellent mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are being exploited in a growing number of applications from ballistic armour to nanoelectronics. However, measurements of these properties have not achieved the values predicted by theory due to a combination of artifacts introduced during sample preparation and inadequate measurements. Here we report multiwalled carbon nanotubes with a mean fracture strength &gt;100 GPa, which exceeds earlier observations by a factor of approximately three. These results are in excellent agreement with quantum-mechanical estimates for nanotubes containing only an occasional vacancy defect, and are &#8764;80% of the values expected for defect-free tubes. This performance is made possible by omitting chemical treatments from the sample preparation process, thus avoiding the formation of defects. High-resolution imaging was used to directly determine the number of fractured shells and the chirality of the outer shell. Electron irradiation at 200 keV for 10, 100 and 1,800 s led to improvements in the maximum sustainable loads by factors of 2.4, 7.9 and 11.6 compared with non-irradiated samples of similar diameter. This effect is attributed to crosslinking between the shells. Computer simulations also illustrate the effects of various irradiation-induced crosslinking defects on load sharing between the shells.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, 60208-3111, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Bei Peng', ',\xa0Mark Locascio', ',\xa0Shuyou Li', '\xa0&\xa0Horacio D.
