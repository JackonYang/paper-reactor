letter,Spatial periodicity in molecular switching,"<p>The ultimate miniaturization of future devices will require the use of functional molecules at the nanoscale and their integration into larger architectures. Switches represent a prototype of such functional molecules because they exhibit characteristic states of different physical/chemical properties, which can be addressed reversibly. Recently, various switching entities have been studied and switching of single molecules on surfaces has been demonstrated. However, for functional molecules to be used in a future device, it will be necessary to selectively address individual molecules, preferentially in an ordered pattern. Here, we show that azobenzene derivatives in the trans form, adsorbed in a homogeneous two-dimensional layer, can be collectively switched with spatial selectivity, thus forming a periodic pattern of cis isomers. We find that the probability of a molecule switching is not equally distributed, but is strongly dependent on both the surrounding molecules and the supporting surface, which precisely determine the switching capability of each individual molecule. Consequently, exactly the same lattices of cis isomers are created in repeated erasing and re-switching cycles. Our results demonstrate a conceptually new approach to spatially addressing single functional molecules.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Experimental Physics, Freie Universität Berlin, Arnimallee 14, Berlin, 14195, Germany', 'authors': ['Carlo Dri', '\xa0&\xa0Leonhard Grill']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and CENMAT, University of Trieste, 34127 Trieste, Italy', 'authors': ['Carlo Dri']}, {'address': 'CNR-INFM Laboratorio TASC, Area Science Park, S.S. 14 Km 163.5, Basovizza-Trieste, 34012, Italy', 'authors': ['Carlo Dri']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Brook-Taylor-Str. 2, Berlin, 12489, Germany', 'authors': ['Maike V.

letter,"Current saturation in zero-bandgap, top-gated graphene field-effect transistors","<p>The novel electronic properties of graphene, including a linear energy dispersion relation and purely two-dimensional structure, have led to intense research into possible applications of this material in nanoscale devices. Here we report the first observation of saturating transistor characteristics in a graphene field-effect transistor. The saturation velocity depends on the charge-carrier concentration and we attribute this to scattering by interfacial phonons in the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer supporting the graphene channels. Unusual features in the current&#8211;voltage characteristic are explained by a field-effect model and diffusive carrier transport in the presence of a singular point in the density of states. The electrostatic modulation of the channel through an efficiently coupled top gate yields transconductances as high as 150&#160;&#181;S&#160;&#181;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> despite low on&#8211;off current ratios.

letter,Integration of photonic and silver nanowire plasmonic waveguides,"<p>Future optical data transmission modules will require the integration of more than 10,000&#160;&#215;&#160;10,000 input and output channels to increase data transmission rates and capacity. This level of integration, which greatly exceeds that of a conventional diffraction-limited photonic integrated circuit, will require the use of waveguides with a mode confinement below the diffraction limit, and also the integration of these waveguides with diffraction-limited components. We propose to integrate multiple silver nanowire plasmonic waveguides with polymer optical waveguides for the nanoscale confinement and guiding of light on a chip. In our device, the nanowires lay perpendicular to the polymer waveguide with one end inside the polymer. We theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate coupling of light into multiple nanowires from the same waveguide, and also demonstrate control over the degree of coupling by changing the light polarization.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, 98105, Washington, USA', 'authors': ['Anna L.

letter,Designing artificial cells to harness the biological ion concentration gradient,"<p>Cell membranes contain numerous nanoscale conductors in the form of ion channels and ion pumps that work together to form ion concentration gradients across the membrane to trigger the release of an action potential. It seems natural to ask if artificial cells can be built to use ion transport as effectively as natural cells. Here we report a mathematical calculation of the conversion of ion concentration gradients into action potentials across different nanoscale conductors in a model electrogenic cell (electrocyte) of an electric eel. Using the parameters extracted from the numerical model, we designed an artificial cell based on an optimized selection of conductors. The resulting cell is similar to the electrocyte but has higher power output density and greater energy conversion efficiency. We suggest methods for producing these artificial cells that could potentially be used to power medical implants and other tiny devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, 06520, Connecticut, USA', 'authors': ['Jian Xu']}, {'address': 'National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, 20899, Maryland, USA', 'authors': ['David A.

letter,A thixotropic nanocomposite gel for three-dimensional cell culture,"<p>Thixotropic materials, which become less viscous under stress and return to their original state when stress is removed, have been used to deliver gel&#8211;cell constructs and therapeutic agents. Here we show that a polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite thixotropic gel can be used as a three-dimensional cell culture material. The gel liquefies when vortexed&#8212;allowing cells and biological components to be added&#8212;and resolidifies to trap the components when the shear force from spinning is removed. Good permeability of nutrients and gases through the gel allows various cell types to proliferate and be viable for up to three weeks. Human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in stiffer gels developed bone-like behaviour, showing that the rheological properties of the gel can control cell differentiation. No enzymatic, chemical, or photo-crosslinking, changes in ionic strength or temperature are required to form or liquefy the gel, offering a way to sub-culture cells without using trypsin&#8212;a protease commonly used in traditional cell culture techniques.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, 31 Biopolis Way, The Nanos, 138669, Singapore', 'authors': ['Y.

article,Free-standing graphene at atomic resolution,"<p>Research interest in graphene, a two-dimensional crystal consisting of a single atomic plane of carbon atoms, has been driven by its extraordinary properties, including charge carriers that mimic ultra-relativistic elementary particles. Moreover, graphene exhibits ballistic electron transport on the submicrometre scale, even at room temperature, which has allowed the demonstration of graphene-based field-effect transistors and the observation of a room-temperature quantum Hall effect. Here we confirm the presence of free-standing, single-layer graphene with directly interpretable atomic-resolution imaging combined with the spatially resolved study of both the &#960;&#160;&#8594;&#160;&#960;* transition and the &#960;&#160;+&#160;&#963; plasmon.

article,Nanopatterning self-assembled nanoparticle superlattices by moulding microdroplets,"<p>Highly ordered arrays of nanoparticles exhibit many properties that are not found in their disordered counterparts. However, these nanoparticle superlattices usually form in a far-from-equilibrium dewetting process, which precludes the use of conventional patterning methods owing to a lack of control over the local dewetting dynamics. Here, we report a simple yet efficient approach for patterning such superlattices that involves moulding microdroplets containing the nanoparticles and spatially regulating their dewetting process. This approach can provide rational control over the local nucleation and growth of the nanoparticle superlattices. Using DNA-capped gold nanoparticles as a model system, we have patterned nanoparticle superlattices over large areas into a number of versatile structures with high degrees of internal order, including single-particle-width corrals, single-particle-thickness microdiscs and submicrometre-sized &#8216;supra-crystals&#8217;. Remarkably, these features could be addressed by micropatterned electrode arrays, suggesting potential applications in bottom-up nanodevices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biological & Environmental Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Wenlong Cheng', ',\xa0Nokyoung Park', ',\xa0M.

article,Nanomechanical detection of antibiotic–mucopeptide binding in a model for superbug drug resistance,"<p>The alarming growth of the antibiotic-resistant superbugs methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is driving the development of new technologies to investigate antibiotics and their modes of action. We report the label-free detection of vancomycin binding to bacterial cell wall precursor analogues (mucopeptides) on cantilever arrays, with 10&#160;nM sensitivity and at clinically relevant concentrations in blood serum. Differential measurements have quantified binding constants for vancomycin-sensitive and vancomycin-resistant mucopeptide analogues. Moreover, by systematically modifying the mucopeptide density we gain new insights into the origin of surface stress. We propose that stress is a product of a local chemical binding factor and a geometrical factor describing the mechanical connectivity of regions activated by local binding in terms of a percolation process. Our findings place BioMEMS devices in a new class of percolative systems. The percolation concept will underpin the design of devices and coatings to significantly lower the drug detection limit and may also have an impact on our understanding of antibiotic drug action in bacteria.</p>",,"[{'address': 'London Centre for Nanotechnology and Departments of Medicine and Physics, University College London, 17–19 Gordon Street, London, WC1H 0AH, UK', 'authors': ['Joseph Wafula Ndieyira', ',\xa0Moyu Watari', ',\xa0Alejandra Donoso Barrera', ',\xa0Manuel Vögtli', ',\xa0Torsten Strunz', ',\xa0Mike A.
