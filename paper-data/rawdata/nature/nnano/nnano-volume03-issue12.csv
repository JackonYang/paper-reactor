letter,Time-domain control of ultrahigh-frequency nanomechanical systems,"<p>Nanoelectromechanical systems could have applications in fields as diverse as ultrasensitive mass detection and mechanical computation, and can also be used to explore fundamental phenomena such as quantized heat conductance and quantum-limited displacement. Most nanomechanical studies to date have been performed in the frequency domain. However, applications in computation and information storage will require transient excitation and high-speed time-domain operation of nanomechanical systems. Here we show a time-resolved optical approach to the transduction of ultrahigh-frequency nanoelectromechanical systems, and demonstrate that coherent control of nanomechanical oscillation is possible through appropriate pulse programming. A series of cantilevers with resonant frequencies ranging from less than 10&#160;MHz to over 1&#160;GHz are characterized using the same pulse parameters.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, T6G 2G7, Canada', 'authors': ['N.

letter,Nanomechanical detection of itinerant electron spin flip,"<p>Electrons and other fundamental particles have an intrinsic angular momentum called spin. A change in the spin state of such a particle is therefore equivalent to a mechanical torque. This spin-induced torque is central to our understanding of experiments ranging from the measurement of the angular momentum of photons and the g-factor of metals to magnetic resonance and magnetization reversal in magnetic multilayers. When a spin-polarized current passes through a metallic nanowire in which one half is ferromagnetic and the other half is nonmagnetic, the spins of the itinerant electrons are &#8216;flipped&#8217; at the interface between the two regions to produces a torque. Here, we report direct measurement of this mechanical torque in an integrated nanoscale torsion oscillator, and measurements of the itinerant electron spin polarization that could yield new information on the itinerancy of the d-band electrons. The unprecedented torque sensitivity of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;22</sup>&#160;N-m&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> may have applications in spintronics and precision measurements of charge&#8211;parity-violating forces, and might also enable experiments on the untwisting of DNA and torque-generating molecules.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Boston University, 590 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, 02215, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Guiti Zolfagharkhani', ',\xa0Pascal Degiovanni', '\xa0&\xa0Pritiraj Mohanty']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Boston University, 110 Cummington Street, Boston, 02215, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Alexei Gaidarzhy']}, {'address': ""Université de Lyon, Fédération de Physique André Marie Ampère, CNRS-Laboratoire de Physique de l'Ecole Normale, Supérieure de Lyon, 46 Allée d'Italie, Lyon Cedex 07, 69364, France"", 'authors': ['Pascal Degiovanni']}, {'address': 'Jacobs University Bremen, School of Engineering and Science, Campus Ring 1, Bremen, D-28759, Germany', 'authors': ['Stefan Kettemann']}, {'address': 'Asia Pacific Centre for Theoretical Physics, Namgu Pohang, Gyeongbuk, 790-784, Korea', 'authors': ['Peter Fulde']}]",False,"['Guiti Zolfagharkhani', 'Alexei Gaidarzhy', 'Pascal Degiovanni', 'Stefan Kettemann', 'Peter Fulde', 'Pritiraj Mohanty']","Zolfagharkhani, G., Gaidarzhy, A., Degiovanni, P. et al.

letter,Giant negative thermal expansion in magnetic nanocrystals,"<p>Most solids expand when they are heated, but a property known as negative thermal expansion has been observed in a number of materials, including the oxide ZrW<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (ref.&#160;) and the framework material Zn<sub>x</sub>Cd<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>(CN)<sub>2</sub> (refs). This unusual behaviour can be understood in terms of low-energy phonons, while the colossal values of both positive and negative thermal expansion recently observed in another framework material, Ag<sub>3</sub>[Co(CN)<sub>6</sub>], have been explained in terms of the geometric flexibility of its metal&#8211;cyanide&#8211;metal linkages. Thermal expansion can also be stopped in some magnetic transition metal alloys below their magnetic ordering temperature, a phenomenon known as the Invar effect, and the possibility of exploiting materials with tuneable positive or negative thermal expansion in industrial applications has led to intense interest in both the Invar effect and negative thermal expansion. Here we report the results of thermal expansion experiments on three magnetic nanocrystals&#8212;CuO, MnF<sub>2</sub> and NiO&#8212;and find evidence for negative thermal expansion in both CuO and MnF<sub>2</sub> below their magnetic ordering temperatures, but not in NiO. Larger particles of CuO and MnF<sub>2</sub> also show prominent magnetostriction (that is, they change shape in response to an applied magnetic field), which results in significantly reduced thermal expansion below their magnetic ordering temperatures; this behaviour is not observed in NiO. We propose that the negative thermal expansion effect in CuO (which is four times larger than that observed in ZrW<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) and MnF<sub>2</sub> is a general property of nanoparticles in which there is strong coupling between magnetism and the crystal lattice.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga, 840-8502, Japan', 'authors': ['X.

letter,Detection of heating in current-carrying molecular junctions by Raman scattering,"<p>As the scaling of electronic components continues, local heating will have an increasing influence on the stability and performance of nanoscale electronic devices. In particular, the low heat capacity of molecular junctions means that it will be essential to understand local heating and heat conduction in these junctions. Here we report a method for directly monitoring the effective temperature of current-carrying junctions with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) that involves measuring both the Stokes and anti-Stokes components of the Raman scattering. All the Raman-active modes in our system show similar heating as a function of bias at room temperature, which suggests fast vibrational relaxation processes inside the junctions.

letter,Flying plasmonic lens in the near field for high-speed nanolithography,"<p>The commercialization of nanoscale devices requires the development of high-throughput nanofabrication technologies that allow frequent design changes. Maskless nanolithography, including electron-beam and scanning-probe lithography, offers the desired flexibility but is limited by low throughput. Here, we report a new low-cost, high-throughput approach to maskless nanolithography that uses an array of plasmonic lenses that &#8216;flies&#8217; above the surface to be patterned, concentrating short-wavelength surface plasmons into sub-100&#160;nm spots. However, these nanoscale spots are only formed in the near field, which makes it very difficult to scan the array above the surface at high speed. To overcome this problem we have designed a self-spacing air bearing that can fly the array just 20&#160;nm above a disk that is spinning at speeds of between 4 and 12&#160;m&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and have experimentally demonstrated patterning with a linewidth of 80&#160;nm.

letter,"Wideband-tuneable, nanotube mode-locked, fibre laser","<p>Ultrashort-pulse lasers with spectral tuning capability have widespread applications in fields such as spectroscopy, biomedical research and telecommunications. Mode-locked fibre lasers are convenient and powerful sources of ultrashort pulses, and the inclusion of a broadband saturable absorber as a passive optical switch inside the laser cavity may offer tuneability over a range of wavelengths. Semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors are widely used in fibre lasers, but their operating range is typically limited to a few tens of nanometres, and their fabrication can be challenging in the 1.3&#8211;1.5&#160;&#181;m wavelength region used for optical communications. Single-walled carbon nanotubes are excellent saturable absorbers because of their subpicosecond recovery time, low saturation intensity, polarization insensitivity, and mechanical and environmental robustness. Here, we engineer a nanotube&#8211;polycarbonate film with a wide bandwidth (&gt;300&#160;nm) around 1.55&#160;&#181;m, and then use it to demonstrate a 2.4&#160;ps Er<sup>3+</sup>-doped fibre laser that is tuneable from 1,518 to 1,558&#160;nm.
