letter,Enzyme-assisted self-assembly under thermodynamic control,"<p>The production of functional molecular architectures through self-assembly is commonplace in biology, but despite advances, it is still a major challenge to achieve similar complexity in the laboratory. Self-assembled structures that are reproducible and virtually defect free are of interest for applications in three-dimensional cell culture, templating, biosensing and supramolecular electronics. Here, we report the use of reversible enzyme-catalysed reactions to drive self-assembly. In this approach, the self-assembly of aromatic short peptide derivatives provides a driving force that enables a protease enzyme to produce building blocks in a reversible and spatially confined manner. We demonstrate that this system combines three features: (i) self-correction&#8212;fully reversible self-assembly under thermodynamic control; (ii) component-selection&#8212;the ability to amplify the most stable molecular self-assembly structures in dynamic combinatorial libraries; and (iii) spatiotemporal confinement of nucleation and structure growth. Enzyme-assisted self-assembly therefore provides control in bottom-up fabrication of nanomaterials that could ultimately lead to functional nanostructures with enhanced complexities and fewer defects.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Materials, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK', 'authors': ['Richard J.

letter,High-throughput solution processing of large-scale graphene,"<p>The electronic properties of graphene, such as high charge carrier concentrations and mobilities, make it a promising candidate for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. In particular, electrons and holes can undergo ballistic transport on the sub-micrometre scale in graphene and do not suffer from the scale limitations of current MOSFET technologies. However, it is still difficult to produce single-layer samples of graphene and bulk processing has not yet been achieved, despite strenuous efforts to develop a scalable production method. Here, we report a versatile solution-based process for the large-scale production of single-layer chemically converted graphene over the entire area of a silicon/SiO<sub>2</sub> wafer. By dispersing graphite oxide paper in pure hydrazine we were able to remove oxygen functionalities and restore the planar geometry of the single sheets. The chemically converted graphene sheets that were produced have the largest area reported to date (up to 20&#160;&#215;&#160;40&#160;&#181;m), making them far easier to process. Field-effect devices have been fabricated by conventional photolithography, displaying currents that are three orders of magnitude higher than previously reported for chemically produced graphene. The size of these sheets enables a wide range of characterization techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, to be performed on the same specimen.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering and California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA', 'authors': ['Vincent C.

letter,Gram-scale production of graphene based on solvothermal synthesis and sonication,"<p>Carbon nanostructures have emerged as likely candidates for a wide range of applications, driving research into novel synthetic techniques to produce nanotubes, graphene and other carbon-based materials. Single sheets of pristine graphene have been isolated from bulk graphite in small amounts by micromechanical cleavage, and larger amounts of chemically modified graphene sheets have been produced by a number of approaches. Both of these techniques make use of highly oriented pyrolitic graphite as a starting material and involve labour-intensive preparations. Here, we report the direct chemical synthesis of carbon nanosheets in gram-scale quantities in a bottom-up approach based on the common laboratory reagents ethanol and sodium, which are reacted to give an intermediate solid that is then pyrolized, yielding a fused array of graphene sheets that are dispersed by mild sonication. The ability to produce bulk graphene samples from non-graphitic precursors with a scalable, low-cost approach should take us a step closer to real-world applications of graphene.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Chemistry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2052, Australia', 'authors': ['Mohammad Choucair', ',\xa0Pall Thordarson', '\xa0&\xa0John A.

letter,Power generation with laterally packaged piezoelectric fine wires,"<p>Converting mechanical energy into electricity could have applications in sensing, medical science, defence technology and personal electronics, and the ability of nanowires to &#8216;scavenge&#8217; energy from ambient and environmental sources could prove useful for powering nanodevices. Previously reported nanowire generators were based on vertically aligned piezoelectric nanowires that were attached to a substrate at one end and free to move at the other. However, there were problems with the output stability, mechanical robustness, lifetime and environmental adaptability of such devices. Here we report a flexible power generator that is based on cyclic stretching&#8211;releasing of a piezoelectric fine wire that is firmly attached to metal electrodes at both ends, is packaged on a flexible substrate, and does not involve sliding contacts. Repeatedly stretching and releasing a single wire with a strain of 0.05&#8211;0.1% creates an oscillating output voltage of up to &#8764;50 mV, and the energy conversion efficiency of the wire can be as high as 6.8%.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, 30332-0245, Georgia, USA', 'authors': ['Rusen Yang', ',\xa0Yong Qin', '\xa0&\xa0Zhong Lin Wang']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Dayton, Ohio, 45469, USA', 'authors': ['Liming Dai']}]",False,"['Rusen Yang', 'Yong Qin', 'Liming Dai', 'Zhong Lin Wang']","Yang, R., Qin, Y., Dai, L. et al.

letter,"Fast, sensitive and spectrally tuneable colloidal-quantum-dot photodetectors","<p>Solution-processed semiconductors are compatible with a range of substrates, which enables their direct integration with organic circuits, microfluidics, optical circuitry and commercial microelectronics. Ultrasensitive photodetectors based on solution-process colloidal quantum dots operating in both the visible and infrared have been demonstrated, but these devices have poor response times (on the scale of seconds) to changes in illumination, and rapid-response devices based on a photodiode architecture suffer from low sensitivity. Here, we show that the temporal response of these devices is determined by two components&#8212;electron drift, which is a fast process, and electron diffusion, which is a slow process. By building devices that exclude the diffusion component, we are able to demonstrate a &gt;1,000-fold improvement in the sensitivity&#8211;bandwidth product of tuneable colloidal-quantum-dot photodiodes operating in the visible and infrared.</p>",,"[{'address': ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 10 King's College Road, Toronto, M5S 3G4, Ontario, Canada"", 'authors': ['Jason P.

letter,Optically monitoring the mechanical assembly of single molecules,"<p>Bottom-up assembly at the level of individual molecules requires a combination of utmost spatial precision and efficient monitoring. We have previously shown how to &#8216;cut-and-paste&#8217; single molecules, and other groups have demonstrated that it is possible to beat the diffraction limit in optical microscopy. Here we show that a combination of single-molecule cut-and-paste surface assembly, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy can be used to deposit individual fluorophores in well-defined nanoscale patterns and also to monitor the process in real time with nanometre precision. Although the size of the pattern is well below the optical resolution of the microscope, the individual dyes are identified by localizing the centroids and detecting the photobleaching of the fluorophores. With this combination of methods, individual dyes or labelled biomolecules can be arranged at will for specific functions, such as coupled fluorophore systems or tailored enzyme cascades, and monitored with nanoscale precision.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Centre for Nanoscience and Physics Department, University of Munich, Amalienstrasse 54, Munich, 80799, Germany', 'authors': ['Stefan K.

article,Controlled polytypic and twin-plane superlattices in iii–v nanowires,"<p>Semiconductor nanowires show promise for use in nanoelectronics, fundamental electron transport studies, quantum optics and biological sensing. Such applications require a high degree of nanowire growth control, right down to the atomic level. However, many binary semiconductor nanowires exhibit a high density of randomly distributed twin defects and stacking faults, which results in an uncontrolled, or polytypic, crystal structure. Here, we demonstrate full control of the crystal structure of InAs nanowires by varying nanowire diameter and growth temperature. By selectively tuning the crystal structure, we fabricate highly reproducible polytypic and twin-plane superlattices within single nanowires. In addition to reducing defect densities, this level of control could lead to bandgap engineering and novel electronic behaviour.</p>",,"[{'address': 'The Nanometer Structure Consortium/Solid State Physics, Lund University, Box 118, Lund, S-22100, Sweden', 'authors': ['P.

article,Tuning the optical and electronic properties of colloidal nanocrystals by lattice strain,"<p>Strain can have a large influence on the properties of materials at the nanoscale. The effect of lattice strain on semiconductor devices has been widely studied, but its influence on colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals is still poorly understood. Here we show that the epitaxial deposition of a compressive shell (ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS or CdSe) onto a soft nanocrystalline core (CdTe) to form a lattice-mismatched quantum dot can dramatically change the conduction and valence band energies of both the core and the shell. In particular, standard type-I quantum-dot behaviour is replaced by type-II behaviour, which is characterized by spatial separation of electrons and holes, extended excited-state lifetimes and giant spectral shifts. Moreover, the strain induced by the lattice mismatch can be used to tune the light emission&#8212;which displays narrow linewidths and high quantum yields&#8212;across the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum (500&#8211;1,050&#160;nm).

article,Processing and properties of highly enriched double-wall carbon nanotubes,"<p>Carbon nanotubes consist of one or more concentric graphene cylinders and are under investigation for a variety of applications that make use of their excellent thermal, mechanical, electronic and optical properties. Double-wall nanotubes are ideal systems for studying the interwall interactions influencing the properties of nanotubes with two or more walls. However, current techniques to synthesize double-wall nanotubes produce unwanted single- and multiwall nanotubes. Here, we show how density gradient ultracentrifugation can be used to separate double-wall nanotubes from mixtures of single- and multiwall nanotubes through differences in their buoyant density. This technique results in samples that are highly enriched in either single- or double-wall nanotubes of similar outer wall diameter, with the double-wall nanotubes being, on average, &#8764;44% longer than the single-wall nanotubes.
