letter,Cultural cognition of the risks and benefits of nanotechnology,"<p>How is public opinion towards nanotechnology likely to evolve? The &#8216;familiarity hypothesis&#8217; holds that support for nanotechnology will likely grow as awareness of it expands. The basis of this conjecture is opinion polling, which finds that few members of the public claim to know much about nanotechnology, but that those who say they do are substantially more likely to believe its benefits outweigh its risks. Some researchers, however, have avoided endorsing the familiarity hypothesis, stressing that cognitive heuristics and biases could create anxiety as the public learns more about this novel science. We conducted an experimental study aimed at determining how members of the public would react to balanced information about nanotechnology risks and benefits. Finding no support for the familiarity hypothesis, the study instead yielded strong evidence that public attitudes are likely to be shaped by psychological dynamics associated with cultural cognition.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Yale Law School, PO Box 208215, 127 Wall Street, New Haven, 06520, Connecticut, USA', 'authors': ['Dan M.

letter,Religious beliefs and public attitudes toward nanotechnology in Europe and the United States,"<p>How do citizens make sense of nanotechnology as more applications reach the market and the mainstream media start to debate the potential risks and benefits of technology? As with many other political and scientific issues, citizens rely on cognitive shortcuts or heuristics to make sense of issues for which they have low levels of knowledge. These heuristics can include predispositional factors, such as ideological beliefs or value systems, and also short-term frames of reference provided by the media or other sources of information. Recent research suggests that &#8216;religious filters&#8217; are an important heuristic for scientific issues in general, and nanotechnology in particular. A religious filter is more than a simple correlation between religiosity and attitudes toward science: it refers to a link between benefit perceptions and attitudes that varies depending on respondents' levels of religiosity. In surveys, seeing the benefits of nanotechnology is consistently linked to more positive attitudes about nanotechnology among less religious respondents, with this effect being significantly weaker for more religious respondents. For this study, we have combined public opinion surveys in the United States with Eurobarometer surveys about public attitudes toward nanotechnology in Europe to compare the influence of religious beliefs on attitudes towards nanotechnology in the United States and Europe. Our results show that respondents in the United States were significantly less likely to agree that nanotechnology is morally acceptable than respondents in many European countries. These moral views correlated directly with aggregate levels of religiosity in each country, even after controlling for national research productivity and measures of science performance for high-school students.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Life Sciences Communication, University of Wisconsin—Madison, 309 Hiram Smith Hall, 1545 Observatory Drive, Madison, 53706, Wisconsin, USA', 'authors': ['Dietram A.

letter,Deliberating the risks of nanotechnologies for energy and health applications in the United States and United Kingdom,"<p>Emerging nanotechnologies pose a new set of challenges for researchers, governments, industries and citizen organizations that aim to develop effective modes of deliberation and risk communication early in the research and development process. These challenges derive from a number of issues including the wide range of materials and devices covered by the term &#8216;nanotechnology&#8217;, the many different industrial sectors involved, the fact that many areas of nanotechnology are still at a relatively early stage of development, and uncertainty about the environmental, health and safety impacts of nanomaterials. Public surveys have found that people in the United States and Europe currently view the benefits of nanotechnologies as outweighing their risks although, overall, knowledge about nanotechnology remains very low. However, surveys cannot easily uncover the ways that people will interpret and understand the complexities of nanotechnologies (or any other topic about which they know very little) when asked to deliberate about it in more depth, so new approaches to engaging the public are needed. Here, we report the results of the first comparative United States&#8211;United Kingdom public engagement experiment. Based upon four concurrent half-day workshops debating energy and health nanotechnologies we find commonalities that were unexpected given the different risk regulatory histories in the two countries. Participants focused on benefits rather than risks and, in general, had a high regard for science and technology. Application context was much more salient than nation as a source of difference, with energy applications viewed in a substantially more positive light than applications in health and human enhancement in both countries. More subtle differences were present in views about the equitable distribution of benefits, corporate and governmental trustworthiness, the risks to realizing benefits, and in consumerist attitudes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, CF10 3AT, UK', 'authors': ['Nick Pidgeon']}, {'address': 'NSF Centre for Nanotechnology in Society, University of California, Santa Barbara, 93106, California, USA', 'authors': ['Barbara Herr Harthorn']}, {'address': ""Department of Sociology and Women's Studies Program, State University of New York at New Paltz, 600 Hawk Drive, New Paltz, 12561, New York, USA"", 'authors': ['Karl Bryant']}, {'address': 'School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, UK', 'authors': ['Tee Rogers-Hayden']}]",False,"['Nick Pidgeon', 'Barbara Herr Harthorn', 'Karl Bryant', 'Tee Rogers-Hayden']","Pidgeon, N., Harthorn, B., Bryant, K. et al.

letter,Current-driven atomic waterwheels,"<p>A current induces forces on atoms inside the conductor that carries it. It is now possible to compute these forces from scratch, and to perform dynamical simulations of the atomic motion under current. One reason for this interest is that current can be a destructive force&#8212;it can cause atoms to migrate, resulting in damage and in the eventual failure of the conductor. But one can also ask, can current be made to do useful work on atoms? In particular, can an atomic-scale motor be driven by electrical current, as it can be by other mechanisms? For this to be possible, the current-induced forces on a suitable rotor must be non-conservative, so that net work can be done per revolution. Here we show that current-induced forces in atomic wires are not conservative and that they can be used, in principle, to drive an atomic-scale waterwheel.</p>",,"[{'address': ""School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, BT7 1NN, Northern Ireland, UK"", 'authors': ['Daniel Dundas', ',\xa0Eunan J.

letter,Donor deactivation in silicon nanostructures,"<p>The operation of electronic devices relies on the density of free charge carriers available in the semiconductor; in most semiconductor devices this density is controlled by the addition of doping atoms. As dimensions are scaled down to achieve economic and performance benefits, the presence of interfaces and materials adjacent to the semiconductor will become more important and will eventually completely determine the electronic properties of the device. To sustain further improvements in performance, novel field-effect transistor architectures, such as FinFETs and nanowire field-effect transistors, have been proposed as replacements for the planar devices used today, and also for applications in biosensing and power generation. The successful operation of such devices will depend on our ability to precisely control the location and number of active impurity atoms in the host semiconductor during the fabrication process. Here, we demonstrate that the free carrier density in semiconductor nanowires is dependent on the size of the nanowires. By measuring the electrical conduction of doped silicon nanowires as a function of nanowire radius, temperature and dielectric surrounding, we show that the donor ionization energy increases with decreasing nanowire radius, and that it profoundly modifies the attainable free carrier density at values of the radius much larger than those at which quantum and dopant surface segregation effects set in. At a nanowire radius of 15&#160;nm the carrier density is already 50% lower than in bulk silicon due to the dielectric mismatch between the conducting channel and its surroundings.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Research GmbH, Zurich Research Laboratory, Säumerstrasse 4, Rüschlikon, 8803, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Mikael T.

letter,Imaging the electrical conductance of individual carbon nanotubes with photothermal current microscopy,"<p>The one-dimensional structure of carbon nanotubes leads to a variety of remarkable optical and electrical properties that could be used to develop novel devices. Recently, the electrical conductance of nanotubes has been shown to decrease under optically induced heating by an amount proportional to the temperature change. Here, we show that this decrease is also proportional to the initial nanotube conductance, and make use of this effect to develop a new electrical characterization tool for nanotubes. By scanning the focal spot of a laser across the surface of a device through which current is simultaneously measured, we can construct spatially resolved conductance images of both single and arrayed nanotube transistors. We can also directly image the gate control of these devices. Our results establish photothermal current microscopy as an important addition to the existing suite of characterization techniques for carbon nanotubes and other linear nanostructures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Adam W.

letter,Multimodal optical sensing and analyte specificity using single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>Nanoscale sensing elements offer promise for single-molecule analyte detection in physically or biologically constrained environments. Single-walled carbon nanotubes have several advantages when used as optical sensors, such as photostable near-infrared emission for prolonged detection through biological media and single-molecule sensitivity. Molecular adsorption can be transduced into an optical signal by perturbing the electronic structure of the nanotubes. Here, we show that a pair of single-walled nanotubes provides at least four modes that can be modulated to uniquely fingerprint agents by the degree to which they alter either the emission band intensity or wavelength. We validate this identification method in vitro by demonstrating the detection of six genotoxic analytes, including chemotherapeutic drugs and reactive oxygen species, which are spectroscopically differentiated into four distinct classes, and also demonstrate single-molecule sensitivity in detecting hydrogen peroxide. Finally, we detect and identify these analytes in real time within live 3T3 cells, demonstrating multiplexed optical detection from a nanoscale biosensor and the first label-free tool to optically discriminate between genotoxins.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Daniel A.

letter,One-step DNA-programmed growth of luminescent and biofunctionalized nanocrystals,"<p>Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are widely used as lumiphores in biological imaging because their luminescence is both strong and stable, and because they can be biofunctionalized. During synthesis, nanocrystals are typically passivated with hydrophobic organic ligands, so it is then necessary either to replace these ligands or encapsulate the nanocrystals with hydrophilic moieties to make the lumiphores soluble in water. Finally, biological labels must be added to allow the detection of nucleic acids, proteins and specific cell types. This multistep process is time- and labour-intensive and thus out of reach of many researchers who want to use luminescent nanocrystals as customized lumiphores. Here, we show that a single designer ligand&#8212;a chimeric DNA molecule&#8212;can controllably program both the growth and the biofunctionalization of the nanocrystals. One part of the DNA sequence controls the nanocrystal passivation and serves as a ligand, while another part controls the biorecognition. The synthetic protocol reported here is straightforward and produces a homogeneous dispersion of nanocrystal lumiphores functionalized with a single biomolecular receptor. The nanocrystals exhibit strong optical emission in the visible region, minimal toxicity and have hydrodynamic diameters of &#8764;6 nm, which makes them suitable for bioimaging. We show that the nanocrystals can specifically bind DNA, proteins or cells that have unique surface recognition markers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 3M2, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Nan Ma', '\xa0&\xa0Shana O.

article,Carbon nanotubes might improve neuronal performance by favouring electrical shortcuts,"<p>Carbon nanotubes have been applied in several areas of nerve tissue engineering to probe and augment cell behaviour, to label and track subcellular components, and to study the growth and organization of neural networks. Recent reports show that nanotubes can sustain and promote neuronal electrical activity in networks of cultured cells, but the ways in which they affect cellular function are still poorly understood. Here, we show, using single-cell electrophysiology techniques, electron microscopy analysis and theoretical modelling, that nanotubes improve the responsiveness of neurons by forming tight contacts with the cell membranes that might favour electrical shortcuts between the proximal and distal compartments of the neuron. We propose the &#8216;electrotonic hypothesis&#8217; to explain the physical interactions between the cell and nanotube, and the mechanisms of how carbon nanotubes might affect the collective electrical activity of cultured neuronal networks. These considerations offer a perspective that would allow us to predict or engineer interactions between neurons and carbon nanotubes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Life Science Department, B.R.A.I.N., University of Trieste, via Fleming 22, Trieste, I-34127, Italy', 'authors': ['Giada Cellot', ',\xa0Emanuele Cilia', ',\xa0Vladimir Rancic', ',\xa0Antonella Sucapane', '\xa0&\xa0Laura Ballerini']}, {'address': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Trieste, Piazzale Europa 1, Trieste, I-34127, Italy', 'authors': ['Sara Cipollone', ',\xa0Silvia Giordani', '\xa0&\xa0Maurizio Prato']}, {'address': 'Laboratory of Neural Microcircuitry, Brain Mind Institute, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Station 15, Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Luca Gambazzi', ',\xa0Henry Markram', '\xa0&\xa0Michele Giugliano']}, {'address': 'Neurobiology Sector, International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), via Beirut 2–4, Trieste, 34014, Italy', 'authors': ['Micaela Grandolfo']}, {'address': 'ELETTRA Sincrotrone Trieste Strada Statale 14, Basovizza, Trieste, Italy', 'authors': ['Denis Scaini', '\xa0&\xa0Loredana Casalis']}, {'address': 'Biosciences and Biotechnology Department, University of Milan-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 2, Milan, 20126, Italy', 'authors': ['Fabrizio Gelain']}, {'address': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Antwerp, Universiteitsplein 1, Wilrijk, B-2610, Belgium', 'authors': ['Michele Giugliano']}]",False,"['Giada Cellot', 'Emanuele Cilia', 'Sara Cipollone', 'Vladimir Rancic', 'Antonella Sucapane', 'Silvia Giordani', 'Luca Gambazzi', 'Henry Markram', 'Micaela Grandolfo', 'Denis Scaini', 'Fabrizio Gelain', 'Loredana Casalis', 'Maurizio Prato', 'Michele Giugliano', 'Laura Ballerini']","Cellot, G., Cilia, E., Cipollone, S. et al.
