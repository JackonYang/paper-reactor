letter,Observation of the smallest metal nanotube with a square cross-section,"<p>Understanding the mechanical properties of nanoscale systems requires a range of measurement techniques and theoretical approaches to gather the relevant physical and chemical information. The arrangements of atoms in nanostructures and macroscopic matter can be different, principally due to the role of surface energy, but the interplay between atomic and electronic structure in association with applied mechanical stress can also lead to surprising differences. For example, metastable structures such as suspended chains of atoms and helical wires have been produced by stretching metal junctions. Here, we report the spontaneous formation of the smallest possible metal nanotube with a square cross-section during the elongation of silver nanocontacts. Ab initio calculations and molecular simulations indicate that the hollow wire forms because this configuration allows the surface energy to be minimized, and also generates a soft structure capable of absorbing a huge tensile deformation.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

letter,Infrared nanoscopy of strained semiconductors,"<p>Knowledge about strain at the nanometre scale is essential for tailoring the mechanical and electronic properties of materials. Flaws, cracks and their local strain fields can be detrimental to the structural integrity of many solids. Conversely, the controlled straining of silicon can be used to improve the performance of electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate that infrared near-field microscopy allows direct, non-invasive mapping and a semiquantitative analysis of residual strain fields in polar semiconductor crystals with nanometre-scale resolution. Our experiments with silicon carbide crystals yield optical images of nanoindents showing strain features as small as 50&#160;nm and the evolution of nanocracks. In addition, by imaging nanoindents in doped silicon, we provide experimental evidence for plasmon-assisted near-field imaging of free-carrier properties in nanoscale strain fields. Near-field infrared strain mapping provides possibilities for nanoscale material and device characterization, and could become a tool for nanoscale mapping of the local free-carrier mobility in strain-engineered semiconductors.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

letter,Large voltage-induced magnetic anisotropy change in a few atomic layers of iron,"<p>In the field of spintronics, researchers have manipulated magnetization using spin-polarized currents. Another option is to use a voltage-induced symmetry change in a ferromagnetic material to cause changes in magnetization or in magnetic anisotropy. However, a significant improvement in efficiency is needed before this approach can be used in memory devices with ultralow power consumption. Here, we show that a relatively small electric field (less than 100&#160;mV&#160;nm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) can cause a large change (&#8764;40%) in the magnetic anisotropy of a bcc Fe(001)/MgO(001) junction. The effect is tentatively attributed to the change in the relative occupation of 3d orbitals of Fe atoms adjacent to the MgO barrier. Simulations confirm that voltage-controlled magnetization switching in magnetic tunnel junctions is possible using the anisotropy change demonstrated here, which could be of use in the development of low-power logic devices and non-volatile memory cells.</p>",[],False,"[""T.

letter,A smart dust biosensor powered by kinesin motors,"<p>Biosensors can be miniaturized by either injecting smaller volumes into micro- and nanofluidic devices or immersing increasingly sophisticated particles known as &#8216;smart dust&#8217; into the sample. The term &#8216;smart dust&#8217; originally referred to cubic-millimetre wireless semiconducting sensor devices that could invisibly monitor the environment in buildings and public spaces, but later it also came to include functional micrometre-sized porous silicon particles used to monitor yet smaller environments. The principal challenge in designing smart dust biosensors is integrating transport functions with energy supply into the device. Here, we report a hybrid microdevice that is powered by ATP and relies on antibody-functionalized microtubules and kinesin motors to transport the target analyte into a detection region. The transport step replaces the wash step in traditional double-antibody sandwich assays. Owing to their small size and autonomous function, we envision that large numbers of such smart dust biosensors could be inserted into organisms or distributed into the environment for remote sensing.</p>",[],False,"[""Thorsten Fischer"", ""Ashutosh Agarwal"", ""Henry Hess""]","Fischer, T., Agarwal, A. & Hess, H.

article,Quantum holographic encoding in a two-dimensional electron gas,"<p>The ability of the scanning tunnelling microscope to manipulate single atoms and molecules has allowed a single bit of information to be represented by a single atom or molecule. Although such information densities remain far beyond the reach of real-world devices, it has been assumed that the finite spacing between atoms in condensed-matter systems sets a rigid upper limit on information density. Here, we show that it is possible to exceed this limit with a holographic method that is based on electron wavefunctions rather than free-space optical waves. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and holograms comprised of individually manipulated molecules are used to create and detect electronically projected objects with features as small as &#8764;0.3 nm, and to achieve information densities in excess of 20 bits nm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. Our electronic quantum encoding scheme involves placing tens of bits of information into a single fermionic state.</p>",[],False,"[""Christopher R. Moon"", ""Laila S. Mattos"", ""Brian K.

In particular, antiferromagnetic Cr<sub>7</sub>Ni rings behave as effective spin-1/2 systems at low temperature and show long decoherence times. Here, we show that these rings can be chemically linked to each other and that the coupling between their spins can be tuned by choosing the linker.

article,Quantitative time-resolved measurement of membrane protein–ligand interactions using microcantilever array sensors,"<p>Membrane proteins are central to many biological processes, and the interactions between transmembrane protein receptors and their ligands are of fundamental importance in medical research. However, measuring and characterizing these interactions is challenging. Here we report that sensors based on arrays of resonating microcantilevers can measure such interactions under physiological conditions. A protein receptor&#8212;the FhuA receptor of Escherichia coli&#8212;is crystallized in liposomes, and the proteoliposomes then immobilized on the chemically activated gold-coated surface of the sensor by ink-jet spotting in a humid environment, thus keeping the receptors functional. Quantitative mass-binding measurements of the bacterial virus T5 at subpicomolar concentrations are performed. These experiments demonstrate the potential of resonating microcantilevers for the specific, label-free and time-resolved detection of membrane protein&#8211;ligand interactions in a micro-array format.</p>",[],False,"[""Thomas Braun"", ""Murali Krishna Ghatkesar"", ""Natalija Backmann"", ""Wilfried Grange"", ""Pascale Boulanger"", ""Lucienne Letellier"", ""Hans-Peter Lang"", ""Alex Bietsch"", ""Christoph Gerber"", ""Martin Hegner""]","Braun, T., Ghatkesar, M., Backmann, N. et al.

article,Early detection of aging cartilage and osteoarthritis in mice and patient samples using atomic force microscopy,"<p>The pathological changes in osteoarthritis&#8212;a degenerative joint disease prevalent among older people&#8212;start at the molecular scale and spread to the higher levels of the architecture of articular cartilage to cause progressive and irreversible structural and functional damage. At present, there are no treatments to cure or attenuate the degradation of cartilage. Early detection and the ability to monitor the progression of osteoarthritis are therefore important for developing effective therapies. Here, we show that indentation-type atomic force microscopy can monitor age-related morphological and biomechanical changes in the hips of normal and osteoarthritic mice. Early damage in the cartilage of osteoarthritic patients undergoing hip or knee replacements could similarly be detected using this method. Changes due to aging and osteoarthritis are clearly depicted at the nanometre scale well before morphological changes can be observed using current diagnostic methods.
