letter,Mechanically interlocked calix[4]arene dimers display reversible bond breakage under force,"<p>The physics of nanoscopic systems is strongly governed by thermal fluctuations that produce significant deviations from the behaviour of large ensembles. Stretching experiments of single molecules offer a unique way to study fundamental theories of statistical mechanics, as recently shown for the unzipping of RNA hairpins. Here, we report a molecular design based on oligo calix[4]arene catenanes&#8212;calixarene dimers held together by 16 hydrogen bridges&#8212;in which loops within the molecules limit how far the calixarene nanocapsules can be separated. This mechanically locked structure tunes the energy landscape of dimers, thus permitting the reversible rupture and rejoining of the individual nanocapsules. Experimental evidence, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, reveals the presence of an intermediate state involving the concerted rupture of the 16 hydrogen bridges. Stochastic modelling using a three-well potential under external load allows reconstruction of the energy landscape.</p>",,"[{'address': 'University of Mainz, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Jakob-Welder-Weg 11, Mainz, 55128, Germany', 'authors': ['Matthias Janke', ',\xa0Thorsten Metzroth', ',\xa0Ingo Mey', ',\xa0Gregor Diezemann', ',\xa0Jürgen Gauss', '\xa0&\xa0Andreas Janshoff']}, {'address': 'University of Mainz, Institute of Organic Chemistry, Duesbergweg 10–14, Mainz, 55128, Germany', 'authors': ['Yuliya Rudzevich', ',\xa0Olena Molokanova', '\xa0&\xa0Volker Böhmer']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Center for Biologically Inspired Materials and Material Systems, Duke University, Durham, 27708, North Carolina, USA', 'authors': ['Piotr E.

letter,Mechanically controlled binary conductance switching of a single-molecule junction,"<p>Molecular-scale components are expected to be central to the realization of nanoscale electronic devices. Although molecular-scale switching has been reported in atomic quantum point contacts, single-molecule junctions provide the additional flexibility of tuning the on/off conductance states through molecular design. To date, switching in single-molecule junctions has been attributed to changes in the conformation or charge state of the molecule. Here, we demonstrate reversible binary switching in a single-molecule junction by mechanical control of the metal&#8211;molecule contact geometry. We show that 4,4'-bipyridine&#8211;gold single-molecule junctions can be reversibly switched between two conductance states through repeated junction elongation and compression. Using first-principles calculations, we attribute the different measured conductance states to distinct contact geometries at the flexible but stable nitrogen&#8211;gold bond: conductance is low when the N&#8211;Au bond is perpendicular to the conducting &#960;-system, and high otherwise. This switching mechanism, inherent to the pyridine&#8211;gold link, could form the basis of a new class of mechanically activated single-molecule switches.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720, USA', 'authors': ['Su Ying Quek', ',\xa0Steven G.

Thermoelectric devices can address these limitations while also enabling energy-efficient solutions, and significant progress has been made in the development of nanostructured thermoelectric materials with enhanced figures-of-merit. However, fully functional practical thermoelectric coolers have not been made from these nanomaterials due to the enormous difficulties in integrating nanoscale materials into microscale devices and packaged macroscale systems.

letter,Bottom-up growth of fully transparent contact layers of indium tin oxide nanowires for light-emitting devices,"<p>Thin layers of indium tin oxide are widely used as transparent coatings and electrodes in solar energy cells, flat-panel displays, antireflection coatings, radiation protection and lithium-ion battery materials, because they have the characteristics of low resistivity, strong absorption at ultraviolet wavelengths, high transmission in the visible, high reflectivity in the far-infrared and strong attenuation in the microwave region. However, there is often a trade-off between electrical conductivity and transparency at visible wavelengths for indium tin oxide and other transparent conducting oxides.

letter,Dynamic patterning programmed by DNA tiles captured on a DNA origami substrate,"<p>The aim of nanotechnology is to put specific atomic and molecular species where we want them, when we want them there. Achieving such dynamic and functional control could lead to programmable chemical synthesis and nanoscale systems that are responsive to their environments. Structural DNA nanotechnology offers a powerful route to this goal by combining stable branched DNA motifs with cohesive ends to produce programmed nanomechanical devices and fixed or modified patterned lattices. Here, we demonstrate a dynamic form of patterning in which a pattern component is captured between two independently programmed DNA devices. A simple and robust error-correction protocol has been developed that yields programmed targets in all cases. This capture system can lead to dynamic control either on patterns or on programmed elements; this capability enables computation or a change of structural state as a function of information in the surroundings of the system.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, New York University, New York, New York, 10003, USA', 'authors': ['Hongzhou Gu', '\xa0&\xa0Nadrian C.

letter,Enzyme cascades activated on topologically programmed DNA scaffolds,"<p>The ability of DNA to self-assemble into one-, two- and three-dimensional nanostructures, combined with the precision that is now possible when positioning nanoparticles or proteins on DNA scaffolds, provide a promising approach for the self-organization of composite nanostructures. Predicting and controlling the functions that emerge in self-organized biomolecular nanostructures is a major challenge in systems biology, and although a number of innovative examples have been reported, the emergent properties of systems in which enzymes are coupled together have not been fully explored. Here, we report the self-assembly of a DNA scaffold made of DNA strips that include &#8216;hinges&#8217; to which biomolecules can be tethered. We attach either two enzymes or a cofactor&#8211;enzyme pair to the scaffold, and show that enzyme cascades or cofactor-mediated biocatalysis can proceed effectively; similar processes are not observed in diffusion-controlled homogeneous mixtures of the same components. Furthermore, because the relative position of the two enzymes or the cofactor&#8211;enzyme pair is determined by the topology of the DNA scaffold, it is possible to control the reactivity of the system through the design of the individual DNA strips. This method could lead to the self-organization of complex multi-enzyme cascades.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Chemistry and The Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, 91904, Israel', 'authors': ['Ofer I.

letter,Real-time monitoring of enzyme activity in a mesoporous silicon double layer,"<p>The activity of certain proteolytic enzymes is often an indicator of disease states such as cancer, stroke and neurodegeneracy, so there is a need for rapid assays that can characterize the kinetics and substrate specificity of enzymatic reactions. Nanostructured membranes can efficiently separate biomolecules, but coupling a sensitive detection method to such a membrane remains difficult. Here, we demonstrate a single mesoporous nanoreactor that can isolate and quantify in real time the reaction products of proteases. The reactor consists of two layers of porous films electrochemically prepared from crystalline silicon. The upper layer, with large pore sizes (&#8764;100 nm in diameter), traps the protease and acts as the reactor. The lower layer, with smaller pore sizes (&#8764;6 nm), excludes the proteases and other large proteins and captures the reaction products. Infiltration of the digested fragments into the lower layer produces a measurable change in optical reflectivity, and this allows label-free quantification of enzyme kinetics in real time within a volume of &#8764;5 nl.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Department 0358, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, 92093-0358, California, USA', 'authors': ['Manuel M.

letter,A highly sensitive and selective diagnostic assay based on virus nanoparticles,"<p>Early detection of the protein marker troponin I in patients with a higher risk of acute myocardial infarction can reduce the risk of death from heart attacks. Most troponin assays are currently based on the conventional enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and have detection limits in the nano- and picomolar range. Here, we show that by combining viral nanoparticles, which are engineered to have dual affinity for troponin antibodies and nickel, with three-dimensional nanostructures including nickel nanohairs, we can detect troponin levels in human serum samples that are six to seven orders of magnitude lower than those detectable using conventional enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. The viral nanoparticle helps to orient the antibodies for maximum capture of the troponin markers. High densities of antibodies on the surfaces of the nanoparticles and nanohairs lead to greater binding of the troponin markers, which significantly enhances detection sensitivities. The nickel nanohairs are re-useable and can reproducibly differentiate healthy serum from unhealthy ones.

article,Continuous base identification for single-molecule nanopore DNA sequencing,"<p>A single-molecule method for sequencing DNA that does not require fluorescent labelling could reduce costs and increase sequencing speeds. An exonuclease enzyme might be used to cleave individual nucleotide molecules from the DNA, and when coupled to an appropriate detection system, these nucleotides could be identified in the correct order. Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside 5'-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice. This highly accurate tool is suitable for integration into a system for sequencing nucleic acids and for analysing epigenetic modifications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd, Begbroke Science Park, Sandy Lane, Oxford, OX5 1PF, UK', 'authors': ['James Clarke', ',\xa0Lakmal Jayasinghe', ',\xa0Alpesh Patel', '\xa0&\xa0Stuart Reid']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Chemistry Research Laboratory, Mansfield Road, Oxford, OX1 3TA, UK', 'authors': ['Hai-Chen Wu', ',\xa0Lakmal Jayasinghe', '\xa0&\xa0Hagan Bayley']}]",False,"['James Clarke', 'Hai-Chen Wu', 'Lakmal Jayasinghe', 'Alpesh Patel', 'Stuart Reid', 'Hagan Bayley']","Clarke, J., Wu, H., Jayasinghe, L. et al.
