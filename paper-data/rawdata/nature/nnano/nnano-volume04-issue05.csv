letter,An electric current spike linked to nanoscale plasticity,"<p>The increase in semiconductor conductivity that occurs when a hard indenter is pressed into its surface has been recognized for years, and nanoindentation experiments have provided numerous insights into the mechanical properties of materials. In particular, such experiments have revealed so called pop-in events, where the indenter suddenly enters deeper into the material without any additional force being applied; these mark the onset of the elastic&#8211;plastic transition. Here, we report the observation of a current spike&#8212;a sharp increase in electrical current followed by immediate decay to zero at the end of the elastic deformation&#8212;during the nanoscale deformation of gallium arsenide. Such a spike has not been seen in previous nanoindentation experiments on semiconductors, and our results, supported by ab initio calculations, suggest a common origin for the electrical and mechanical responses of nanodeformed gallium arsenide. This leads us to the conclusion that a phase transition is the fundamental cause of nanoscale plasticity in gallium arsenide, and the discovery calls for a revision of the current dislocation-based understanding of nanoscale plasticity.</p>",[],False,"[""Roman Nowak"", ""Dariusz Chrobak"", ""Shijo Nagao"", ""David Vodnick"", ""Michael Berg"", ""Antti Tukiainen"", ""Markus Pessa""]","Nowak, R., Chrobak, D., Nagao, S. et al.

letter,Nanotubular metal–insulator–metal capacitor arrays for energy storage,"<p>Nanostructured devices have the potential to serve as the basis for next-generation energy systems that make use of densely packed interfaces and thin films. One approach to making such devices is to build multilayer structures of large area inside the open volume of a nanostructured template. Here, we report the use of atomic layer deposition to fabricate arrays of metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal nanocapacitors in anodic aluminium oxide nanopores. These highly regular arrays have a capacitance per unit planar area of &#8764;10 &#181;F cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> for 1-&#181;m-thick anodic aluminium oxide and &#8764;100 &#181;F cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> for 10-&#181;m-thick anodic aluminium oxide, significantly exceeding previously reported values for metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal capacitors in porous templates.

letter,Tunnelling readout of hydrogen-bonding-based recognition,"<p>Hydrogen bonding has a ubiquitous role in electron transport and in molecular recognition, with DNA base pairing being the best-known example. Scanning tunnelling microscope images and measurements of the decay of tunnel current as a molecular junction is pulled apart by the scanning tunnelling microscope tip are sensitive to hydrogen-bonded interactions. Here, we show that these tunnel-decay signals can be used to measure the strength of hydrogen bonding in DNA base pairs. Junctions that are held together by three hydrogen bonds per base pair (for example, guanine&#8211;cytosine interactions) are stiffer than junctions held together by two hydrogen bonds per base pair (for example, adenine&#8211;thymine interactions). Similar, but less pronounced effects are observed on the approach of the tunnelling probe, implying that attractive forces that depend on hydrogen bonds also have a role in determining the rise of current. These effects provide new mechanisms for making sensors that transduce a molecular recognition event into an electronic signal.</p>",[],False,"[""Shuai Chang"", ""Jin He"", ""Ashley Kibel"", ""Myeong Lee"", ""Otto Sankey"", ""Peiming Zhang"", ""Stuart Lindsay""]","Chang, S., He, J., Kibel, A. et al.

letter,A molecular force probe,"<p>Force probes allow reaction rates to be measured as a function of the restoring force in a molecule that has been stretched or compressed. Unlike strain energy, approaches based on restoring force allow quantitative molecular understanding of phenomena as diverse as translation of microscopic objects by reacting molecules, crack propagation and mechanosensing. Conceptually, localized reactions offer the best opportunity to gain fundamental insights into how rates vary with restoring forces, but such reactions are particularly difficult to study systematically using microscopic force probes. Here, we show how a molecular force probe, stiff stilbene, simplifies force spectroscopy of localized reactions. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach by validating the central postulate of chemomechanical kinetics&#8212;force lowers the activation barrier proportionally to the difference in a single internuclear distance between the ground and transition states projected on the force vector&#8212;on a paradigmatic unimolecular reaction: concerted dissociation of the C&#8211;C bond.</p>",[],False,"[""Qing-Zheng Yang"", ""Zhen Huang"", ""Timothy J.

letter,Three-dimensional imaging of short-range chemical forces with picometre resolution,"<p>Chemical forces on surfaces have a central role in numerous scientific and technological fields, including catalysis, thin film growth and tribology. Many applications require knowledge of the strength of these forces as a function of position in three dimensions, but until now such information has only been available from theory. Here, we demonstrate an approach based on atomic force microscopy that can obtain this data, and we use this approach to image the three-dimensional surface force field of graphite. We show force maps with picometre and piconewton resolution that allow a detailed characterization of the interaction between the surface and the tip of the microscope in three dimensions. In these maps, the positions of all atoms are identified, and differences between atoms at inequivalent sites are quantified. The results suggest that the excellent lubrication properties of graphite may be due to a significant localization of the lateral forces.</p>",[],False,"[""Boris J. Albers"", ""Todd C.

letter,Dopant profiling and surface analysis of silicon nanowires using capacitance–voltage measurements,"<p>Silicon nanowires are expected to have applications in transistors, sensors, resonators, solar cells and thermoelectric systems. Understanding the surface properties and dopant distribution will be critical for the fabrication of high-performance devices based on nanowires. At present, determination of the dopant concentration depends on a combination of experimental measurements of the mobility and threshold voltage in a nanowire field-effect transistor, a calculated value for the capacitance, and two assumptions&#8212;that the dopant distribution is uniform and that the surface (interface) charge density is known. These assumptions can be tested in planar devices with the capacitance&#8211;voltage technique. This technique has also been used to determine the mobility of nanowires, but it has not been used to measure surface properties and dopant distributions, despite their influence on the electronic properties of nanowires. Here, we measure the surface (interface) state density and the radial dopant profile of individual silicon nanowire field-effect transistors with the capacitance&#8211;voltage technique.</p>",[],False,"[""Erik C.

letter,Direct measurement of dopant distribution in an individual vapour–liquid–solid nanowire,"<p>Semiconductor nanowires show promise for many device applications, but controlled doping with electronic and magnetic impurities remains an important challenge. Limitations on dopant incorporation have been identified in nanocrystals, raising concerns about the prospects for doping nanostructures. Progress has been hindered by the lack of a method to quantify the dopant distribution in single nanostructures. Recently, we showed that atom probe tomography can be used to determine the composition of isolated nanowires. Here, we report the first direct measurements of dopant concentrations in arbitrary regions of individual nanowires. We find that differences in precursor decomposition rates between the liquid catalyst and solid nanowire surface give rise to a heavily doped shell surrounding an underdoped core. We also present a thermodynamic model that relates liquid and solid compositions to dopant fluxes.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel E. Perea"", ""Eric R. Hemesath"", ""Edwin J. Schwalbach"", ""Jessica L.

letter,Phonon populations and electrical power dissipation in carbon nanotube transistors,"<p>Carbon nanotubes and graphene are candidate materials for nanoscale electronic devices. Both materials show weak acoustic phonon scattering and long mean free paths for low-energy charge carriers. However, high-energy carriers couple strongly to optical phonons, which leads to current saturation and the generation of hot phonons. A non-equilibrium phonon distribution has been invoked to explain the negative differential conductance observed in suspended metallic nanotubes, while Raman studies have shown the electrical generation of hot G-phonons in metallic nanotubes. Here, we present a complete picture of the phonon distribution in a functioning nanotube transistor including the G and the radial breathing modes, the Raman-inactive zone boundary K mode and the intermediate-frequency mode populated by anharmonic decay. The effective temperatures of the high- and intermediate-frequency phonons are considerably higher than those of acoustic phonons, indicating a phonon-decay bottleneck. Most importantly, inclusion of scattering by substrate polar phonons is needed to fully account for the observed electronic transport behaviour.</p>",[],False,"[""Mathias Steiner"", ""Marcus Freitag"", ""Vasili Perebeinos"", ""James C.

article,A DNA nanomachine that maps spatial and temporal pH changes inside living cells,"<p>DNA nanomachines are synthetic assemblies that switch between defined molecular conformations upon stimulation by external triggers. Previously, the performance of DNA devices has been limited to in vitro applications. Here we report the construction of a DNA nanomachine called the I-switch, which is triggered by protons and functions as a pH sensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) inside living cells. It is an efficient reporter of pH from pH 5.5 to 6.8, with a high dynamic range between pH 5.8 and 7. To demonstrate its ability to function inside living cells we use the I-switch to map spatial and temporal pH changes associated with endosome maturation. The performance of our DNA nanodevices inside living systems illustrates the potential of DNA scaffolds responsive to more complex triggers in sensing, diagnostics and targeted therapies in living systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Souvik Modi"", ""Swetha M.
