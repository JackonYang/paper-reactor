letter,Nanoscale shape-memory alloys for ultrahigh mechanical damping,"<p>Shape memory alloys undergo reversible transformations between two distinct phases in response to changes in temperature or applied stress. The creation and motion of the internal interfaces between these phases during such transformations dissipates energy, making these alloys effective mechanical damping materials. Although it has been shown that reversible phase transformations can occur in nanoscale volumes, it is not known whether these transformations have a sample size dependence. Here, we demonstrate that the two phases responsible for shape memory in Cu&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni alloys are more stable in nanoscale pillars than they are in the bulk. As a result, the pillars show a damping figure of merit that is substantially higher than any previously reported value for a bulk material, making them attractive for damping applications in nanoscale and microscale devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Jose San Juan"", ""Maria L.

letter,New aspects of the metal–insulator transition in single-domain vanadium dioxide nanobeams,"<p>Many strongly correlated electronic materials have a domain structure that greatly influences the bulk properties and obscures the fundamental properties of the homogeneous material. Nanoscale samples, on the other hand, can be smaller than the characteristic domain size, thus making it possible to explore these fundamental properties in detail. Here, we report new aspects of the metal&#8211;insulator transition, studied in single-domain vanadium dioxide nanobeams. We have observed supercooling of the metallic phase by 50&#160;&#176;C, an activation energy in the insulating phase that is consistent with the optical gap, and a connection between the metal&#8211;insulator transition and the equilibrium carrier density in the insulating phase. Our devices also provide a nanomechanical method for determining the transition temperature, enable measurements on individual metal&#8211;insulator interphase walls to be made, and allow general investigations of phase transitions in quasi-one-dimensional geometries.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiang Wei"", ""Zenghui Wang"", ""Wei Chen"", ""David H.

letter,Observation of the triplet exciton in EuS-coated single-walled nanotubes,"<p>Photon absorption by carbon nanotubes creates bound electron&#8211;hole pairs called excitons, which can exist in spin-polarized triplet or spin-unpolarized singlet configurations. Triplet excitons are optically inactive owing to the weak spin&#8211;orbit coupling in nanotubes. This prevents the optical injection of electron spin into nanotubes for spintronic applications and limits the efficiency of photocurrent generation. Here, we show that it is possible to optically excite the triplet exciton by using a ferromagnetic semiconductor as a spin filter to mix the singlet and triplet excitons. The triplet contribution to the photocurrent is detected, representing the first direct evidence of the triplet exciton in carbon nanotubes.</p>",[],False,"[""Aditya D. Mohite"", ""Tiffany S.

letter,Multifunctional nanoarchitectures from DNA-based ABC monomers,"<p>The ability to attach different functional moieties to a molecular building block could lead to applications in nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, intelligent sensing and drug delivery. The building unit needs to be both multivalent and anisotropic, and although many anisotropic building blocks have been created, these have not been universally applicable. Recently, DNA has been used to generate various nanostructures or hybrid systems, and as a generic building block for various applications. Here, we report the creation of anisotropic, branched and crosslinkable building blocks (ABC monomers) from which multifunctional nanoarchitectures have been assembled. In particular, we demonstrate a target-driven polymerization process in which polymers are generated only in the presence of a specific DNA molecule, leading to highly sensitive pathogen detection. Using this monomer system, we have also designed a biocompatible nanovector that delivers both drugs and tracers simultaneously. Our approach provides a general yet versatile route towards the creation of a range of multifunctional nanoarchitectures.</p>",[],True,"[""Jong B. Lee"", ""Young H.

letter,Droplet networks with incorporated protein diodes show collective properties,"<p>Recently, we demonstrated that submicrolitre aqueous droplets submerged in an apolar liquid containing lipid can be tightly connected by means of lipid bilayers to form networks. Droplet interface bilayers have been used for rapid screening of membrane proteins and to form asymmetric bilayers with which to examine the fundamental properties of channels and pores. Networks, meanwhile, have been used to form microscale batteries and to detect light. Here, we develop an engineered protein pore with diode-like properties that can be incorporated into droplet interface bilayers in droplet networks to form devices with electrical properties including those of a current limiter, a half-wave rectifier and a full-wave rectifier. The droplet approach, which uses unsophisticated components (oil, lipid, salt water and a simple pore), can therefore be used to create multidroplet networks with collective properties that cannot be produced by droplet pairs.</p>",[],False,"[""Giovanni Maglia"", ""Andrew J.

The unique physical, chemical and electronic properties of nanomaterials allow new modes of interaction with environmental systems that can have unexpected impacts. Here, we show that gold nanorods can readily pass from the water column to the marine food web in three laboratory-constructed estuarine mesocosms containing sea water, sediment, sea grass, microbes, biofilms, snails, clams, shrimp and fish. A single dose of gold nanorods (65&#160;nm length&#160;&#215;&#160;15&#160;nm diameter) was added to each mesocosm and their distribution in the aqueous and sediment phases monitored over 12 days.

article,Towards single-molecule nanomechanical mass spectrometry,"<p>Mass spectrometry provides rapid and quantitative identification of protein species with relatively low sample consumption. The trend towards biological analysis at increasingly smaller scales, ultimately down to the volume of an individual cell, continues, and mass spectrometry with a sensitivity of a few to single molecules will be necessary. Nanoelectromechanical systems provide unparalleled mass sensitivity, which is now sufficient for the detection of individual molecular species in real time. Here, we report the first demonstration of mass spectrometry based on single biological molecule detection with a nanoelectromechanical system. In our nanoelectromechanical&#8211;mass spectrometry system, nanoparticles and protein species are introduced by electrospray injection from the fluid phase in ambient conditions into vacuum, and are subsequently delivered to the nanoelectromechanical system detector by hexapole ion optics. Precipitous frequency shifts, proportional to the mass, are recorded in real time as analytes adsorb, one by one, onto a phase-locked, ultrahigh-frequency nanoelectromechanical resonator. These first nanoelectromechanical system&#8211;mass spectrometry spectra, obtained with modest mass sensitivity from only several hundred mass adsorption events, presage the future capabilities of this approach. We also outline the substantial improvements that are feasible in the near term, some of which are unique to nanoelectromechanical system based-mass spectrometry.</p>",[],False,"[""A. K. Naik"", ""M.

article,Mechanisms for how inhaled multiwalled carbon nanotubes suppress systemic immune function in mice,"<p>The potential health effects of inhaling carbon nanotubes are important because of possible exposures in occupational settings. Previously, we have shown mice that have inhaled multiwalled carbon nanotubes have suppressed systemic immune function. Here, we show the mechanisms for this immune suppression. Mice were exposed to 0, 0.3 or 1&#160;mg&#160;m<sup>&#8722;3</sup> multiwalled carbon nanotubes for 6&#160;h per day for 14 consecutive days in whole-body inhalation chambers. Only those exposed to a dose of 1&#160;mg&#160;m<sup>&#8722;3</sup> presented suppressed immune function; this involved activation of cyclooxygenase enzymes in the spleen in response to a signal from the lungs. Spleen cells from exposed animals partially recovered their immune function when treated with ibuprofen, a drug that blocks the formation of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Knockout mice without cyclooxygenase enzymes were not affected when exposed to multiwalled carbon nanotubes, further confirming the importance of this enzyme in suppression. Proteins from the lungs of exposed mice suppressed the immune function of spleen cells from normal mice, but not those from knockout mice. Our findings suggest that signals from the lung can activate signals in the spleen to suppress the immune function of exposed mice.</p>",[],False,"[""L. A. Mitchell"", ""F. T. Lauer"", ""S. W.

Most peptides form &#945;-helices or &#946;-sheet-like structures that can insert into and subsequently disintegrate negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces. Here, we show that a novel class of core&#8211;shell nanoparticles formed by self-assembly of an amphiphilic peptide have strong antimicrobial properties against a range of bacteria, yeasts and fungi. The nanoparticles show a high therapeutic index against Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice and are more potent than their unassembled peptide counterparts.
