letter,Placement and orientation of individual DNA shapes on lithographically patterned surfaces,"<p>Artificial DNA nanostructures show promise for the organization of functional materials to create nanoelectronic or nano-optical devices. DNA origami, in which a long single strand of DNA is folded into a shape using shorter &#8216;staple strands&#8217;, can display 6-nm-resolution patterns of binding sites, in principle allowing complex arrangements of carbon nanotubes, silicon nanowires, or quantum dots. However, DNA origami are synthesized in solution and uncontrolled deposition results in random arrangements; this makes it difficult to measure the properties of attached nanodevices or to integrate them with conventionally fabricated microcircuitry. Here we describe the use of electron-beam lithography and dry oxidative etching to create DNA origami-shaped binding sites on technologically useful materials, such as SiO<sub>2</sub> and diamond-like carbon. In buffer with &#8764;100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, DNA origami bind with high selectivity and good orientation: 70&#8211;95% of sites have individual origami aligned with an angular dispersion (&#177;1 s.d.) as low as &#177;10&#176; (on diamond-like carbon) or &#177;20&#176; (on SiO<sub>2</sub>).</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, 95120, California, USA', 'authors': ['Ryan J.

letter,Controlled ripple texturing of suspended graphene and ultrathin graphite membranes,"<p>Graphene is nature's thinnest elastic material and displays exceptional mechanical and electronic properties. Ripples are an intrinsic feature of graphene sheets and are expected to strongly influence electronic properties by inducing effective magnetic fields and changing local potentials. The ability to control ripple structure in graphene could allow device design based on local strain and selective bandgap engineering. Here, we report the first direct observation and controlled creation of one- and two-dimensional periodic ripples in suspended graphene sheets, using both spontaneously and thermally generated strains. We are able to control ripple orientation, wavelength and amplitude by controlling boundary conditions and making use of graphene's negative thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), which we measure to be much larger than that of graphite. These results elucidate the ripple formation process, which can be understood in terms of classical thin-film elasticity theory. This should lead to an improved understanding of suspended graphene devices, a controlled engineering of thermal stress in large-scale graphene electronics, and a systematic investigation of the effect of ripples on the electronic properties of graphene.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Riverside, 92521, California, USA', 'authors': ['Wenzhong Bao', ',\xa0Feng Miao', ',\xa0Hang Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Chun Ning Lau']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, 92521, California, USA', 'authors': ['Zhen Chen', ',\xa0Wanyoung Jang', '\xa0&\xa0Chris Dames']}]",False,"['Wenzhong Bao', 'Feng Miao', 'Zhen Chen', 'Hang Zhang', 'Wanyoung Jang', 'Chris Dames', 'Chun Ning Lau']","Bao, W., Miao, F., Chen, Z. et al.

letter,Plasmonic fluorescent quantum dots,"<p>Combining multiple discrete components into a single multifunctional nanoparticle could be useful in a variety of applications. Retaining the unique optical and electrical properties of each component after nanoscale integration is, however, a long-standing problem. It is particularly difficult when trying to combine fluorophores such as semiconductor quantum dots with plasmonic materials such as gold, because gold and other metals can quench the fluorescence. So far, the combination of quantum dot fluorescence with plasmonically active gold has only been demonstrated on flat surfaces. Here, we combine fluorescent and plasmonic activities in a single nanoparticle by controlling the spacing between a quantum dot core and an ultrathin gold shell with nanometre precision through layer-by-layer assembly. Our wet-chemistry approach provides a general route for the deposition of ultrathin gold layers onto virtually any discrete nanostructure or continuous surface, and should prove useful for multimodal bioimaging, interfacing with biological systems, reducing nanotoxicity, modulating electromagnetic fields and contacting nanostructures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, William H.

letter,Single europium-doped nanoparticles measure temporal pattern of reactive oxygen species production inside cells,"<p>Low concentrations of reactive oxygen species, notably hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), mediate various signalling processes in the cell.

Friction measurements as a function of modulation frequency and amplitude indicate that a reduction of friction is responsible for the reduction in wear to below our detection limit.

Despite achieving high power conversion efficiencies, their performance is limited by electron trapping in the nanoparticle film. Electron diffusion lengths can be increased by transporting charge through highly ordered nanostructures such as titania nanotube arrays. Although titania nanotube array films have been shown to enhance the efficiencies of both charge collection and light harvesting, it has not been possible to grow them on transparent conducting oxide glass with the lengths needed for high-efficiency device applications (tens of micrometres). Here, we report the fabrication of transparent titania nanotube array films on transparent conducting oxide glass with lengths between 0.3 and 33.0&#160;&#181;m using a novel electrochemistry approach.

article,A novel magnetic crystal–lipid nanostructure for magnetically guided in vivo gene delivery,"<p>Cancer gene therapy requires a safe and effective gene delivery system. Polymer- and lipid-coated magnetic nanocrystals have been used to deliver silencing RNA, but synthesizing these magnetic vectors is difficult. Here, we show that a new nanoparticle formulation can be magnetically guided to deliver and silence genes in cells and tumours in mice. This formulation, termed LipoMag, consists of an oleic acid-coated magnetic nanocrystal core and a cationic lipid shell. When compared with the commercially available PolyMag formulation, LipoMag displayed more efficient gene silencing in 9 of 13 cell lines, and better anti-tumour effects when systemically administered to mice bearing gastric tumours. By delivering an optimized sequence of a silencing RNA that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor of tumour vessels, the intended therapeutic benefit was achieved with no evident adverse immune reaction or untoward side effects.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Clinical Medicine and Research, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 163-1 Kashiwa-shita, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8567, Japan', 'authors': ['Yoshihisa Namiki', ',\xa0Yukiko Ishii', ',\xa0Akihito Tsubota', ',\xa0Yasuo Mabashi', ',\xa0Yoko Yumoto', ',\xa0Sadayori Hoshina', ',\xa0Kiyotaka Fujise', '\xa0&\xa0Norio Tada']}, {'address': 'Department of Radiology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 163-1 Kashiwa-shita, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8567, Japan', 'authors': ['Tamami Namiki', '\xa0&\xa0Yukiko Ishii']}, {'address': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 163-1 Kashiwa-shita, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8567, Japan', 'authors': ['Hiroshi Yoshida']}, {'address': 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 163-1 Kashiwa-shita, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8567, Japan', 'authors': ['Shigeo Koido', ',\xa0Makoto Mitsunaga', '\xa0&\xa0Kiyotaka Fujise']}, {'address': 'Laboratory Animal Facilities, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 163-1 Kashiwa-shita, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8567, Japan', 'authors': ['Kouichi Nariai']}, {'address': 'Department of Surgery, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 163-1 Kashiwa-shita, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8567, Japan', 'authors': ['Satoru Yanagisawa', '\xa0&\xa0Hideyuki Kashiwagi']}, {'address': 'Division of General Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 163-1 Kashiwa-shita, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8567, Japan', 'authors': ['Norio Tada']}]",False,"['Yoshihisa Namiki', 'Tamami Namiki', 'Hiroshi Yoshida', 'Yukiko Ishii', 'Akihito Tsubota', 'Shigeo Koido', 'Kouichi Nariai', 'Makoto Mitsunaga', 'Satoru Yanagisawa', 'Hideyuki Kashiwagi', 'Yasuo Mabashi', 'Yoko Yumoto', 'Sadayori Hoshina', 'Kiyotaka Fujise', 'Norio Tada']","Namiki, Y., Namiki, T., Yoshida, H. et al.A novel magnetic crystal–lipid nanostructure for magnetically guidedin vivogene delivery.
