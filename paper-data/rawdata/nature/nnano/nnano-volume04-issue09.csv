progress article,Molecular electronics with single molecules in solid-state devices,"<p>The ultimate aim of molecular electronics is to understand and master single-molecule devices. Based on the latest results on electron transport in single molecules in solid-state devices, we focus here on new insights into the influence of metal electrodes on the energy spectrum of the molecule, and on how the electron transport properties of the molecule depend on the strength of the electronic coupling between it and the electrodes.

letter,Placement and orientation of individual DNA shapes on lithographically patterned surfaces,"<p>Artificial DNA nanostructures show promise for the organization of functional materials to create nanoelectronic or nano-optical devices. DNA origami, in which a long single strand of DNA is folded into a shape using shorter &#8216;staple strands&#8217;, can display 6-nm-resolution patterns of binding sites, in principle allowing complex arrangements of carbon nanotubes, silicon nanowires, or quantum dots. However, DNA origami are synthesized in solution and uncontrolled deposition results in random arrangements; this makes it difficult to measure the properties of attached nanodevices or to integrate them with conventionally fabricated microcircuitry. Here we describe the use of electron-beam lithography and dry oxidative etching to create DNA origami-shaped binding sites on technologically useful materials, such as SiO<sub>2</sub> and diamond-like carbon. In buffer with &#8764;100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, DNA origami bind with high selectivity and good orientation: 70&#8211;95% of sites have individual origami aligned with an angular dispersion (&#177;1 s.d.) as low as &#177;10&#176; (on diamond-like carbon) or &#177;20&#176; (on SiO<sub>2</sub>).</p>",[],False,"[""Ryan J.

letter,Controlled ripple texturing of suspended graphene and ultrathin graphite membranes,"<p>Graphene is nature's thinnest elastic material and displays exceptional mechanical and electronic properties. Ripples are an intrinsic feature of graphene sheets and are expected to strongly influence electronic properties by inducing effective magnetic fields and changing local potentials. The ability to control ripple structure in graphene could allow device design based on local strain and selective bandgap engineering. Here, we report the first direct observation and controlled creation of one- and two-dimensional periodic ripples in suspended graphene sheets, using both spontaneously and thermally generated strains. We are able to control ripple orientation, wavelength and amplitude by controlling boundary conditions and making use of graphene's negative thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), which we measure to be much larger than that of graphite. These results elucidate the ripple formation process, which can be understood in terms of classical thin-film elasticity theory. This should lead to an improved understanding of suspended graphene devices, a controlled engineering of thermal stress in large-scale graphene electronics, and a systematic investigation of the effect of ripples on the electronic properties of graphene.</p>",[],False,"[""Wenzhong Bao"", ""Feng Miao"", ""Zhen Chen"", ""Hang Zhang"", ""Wanyoung Jang"", ""Chris Dames"", ""Chun Ning Lau""]","Bao, W., Miao, F., Chen, Z. et al.

Here, we report that quantum dot arrays can be produced inside nanotubes simply by causing a misalignment between the nanotube and the &#12296;100&#12297; direction of a supporting silver substrate.

letter,Plasmonic fluorescent quantum dots,"<p>Combining multiple discrete components into a single multifunctional nanoparticle could be useful in a variety of applications. Retaining the unique optical and electrical properties of each component after nanoscale integration is, however, a long-standing problem. It is particularly difficult when trying to combine fluorophores such as semiconductor quantum dots with plasmonic materials such as gold, because gold and other metals can quench the fluorescence. So far, the combination of quantum dot fluorescence with plasmonically active gold has only been demonstrated on flat surfaces. Here, we combine fluorescent and plasmonic activities in a single nanoparticle by controlling the spacing between a quantum dot core and an ultrathin gold shell with nanometre precision through layer-by-layer assembly. Our wet-chemistry approach provides a general route for the deposition of ultrathin gold layers onto virtually any discrete nanostructure or continuous surface, and should prove useful for multimodal bioimaging, interfacing with biological systems, reducing nanotoxicity, modulating electromagnetic fields and contacting nanostructures.</p>",[],False,"[""Yongdong Jin"", ""Xiaohu Gao""]","Jin, Y., Gao, X.

letter,A quantitative fluorescence study of protein monolayer formation on colloidal nanoparticles,"<p>It is now known that nanoparticles, when exposed to biological fluid, become coated with proteins and other biomolecules to form a &#8216;protein corona&#8217;. Recent systematic studies have identified various proteins that can make up this corona, but these nanoparticle&#8211;protein interactions are still poorly understood, and quantitative studies to characterize them are few in number. Here, we have quantitatively analysed the adsorption of human serum albumin onto small (10&#8211;20 nm in diameter) polymer-coated FePt and CdSe/ZnS nanoparticles by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The protein corona forms a monolayer with a thickness of 3.3 nm. Proteins bind to the negatively charged nanoparticles with micromolar affinity, and time-resolved fluorescence quenching experiments show that they reside on the particle for &#8764;100 s.

letter,Single europium-doped nanoparticles measure temporal pattern of reactive oxygen species production inside cells,"<p>Low concentrations of reactive oxygen species, notably hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), mediate various signalling processes in the cell.

Here, we show that a probe based on a single nanoparticle can quantitatively measure transient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in living cells. The Y<sub>0.6</sub>Eu<sub>0.4</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles undergo photoreduction under laser irradiation but re-oxidize in the presence of oxidants, leading to a recovery in luminescence. Our probe can be regenerated and reliably detects intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with a 30-s temporal resolution and a dynamic range of 1&#8211;45&#160;&#181;M. The differences in the timing of intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production triggered by different signals were also measured using these nanoparticles. Although the probe is not selective towards H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in many signalling processes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is, however, the dominant oxidant.

article,Dynamic superlubricity and the elimination of wear on the nanoscale,"<p>One approach to ultrahigh-density data storage involves the use of arrays of atomic force microscope probes to read and write data on a thin polymer film, but damage to the ultrasharp silicon probe tips caused by mechanical wear has proved problematic. Here, we demonstrate the effective elimination of wear on a tip sliding on a polymer surface over a distance of 750&#160;m by modulating the force acting on the tip&#8211;sample contact. Friction measurements as a function of modulation frequency and amplitude indicate that a reduction of friction is responsible for the reduction in wear to below our detection limit.

article,Long vertically aligned titania nanotubes on transparent conducting oxide for highly efficient solar cells,"<p>Dye-sensitized solar cells consist of a random network of titania nanoparticles that serve both as a high-surface-area support for dye molecules and as an electron-transporting medium. Despite achieving high power conversion efficiencies, their performance is limited by electron trapping in the nanoparticle film. Electron diffusion lengths can be increased by transporting charge through highly ordered nanostructures such as titania nanotube arrays. Although titania nanotube array films have been shown to enhance the efficiencies of both charge collection and light harvesting, it has not been possible to grow them on transparent conducting oxide glass with the lengths needed for high-efficiency device applications (tens of micrometres). Here, we report the fabrication of transparent titania nanotube array films on transparent conducting oxide glass with lengths between 0.3 and 33.0&#160;&#181;m using a novel electrochemistry approach.
