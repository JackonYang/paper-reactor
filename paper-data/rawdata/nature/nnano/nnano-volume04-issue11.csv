letter,Self-assembly of soft nanoparticles with tunable patchiness,"<p>Details of the forces between nanoparticles determine the ways in which the nanoparticles can self-assemble into larger structures. The use of directed interactions has led to new concepts in self-assembly such as asymmetric dendrons, Janus particles, patchy colloids and colloidal molecules. Recent models that include attractive regions or &#8216;patches&#8217; on the surface of the nanoparticles predict a wealth of intricate modes of assembly. Interactions between such particles are also important in a range of phenomena including protein aggregation and crystallization, re-entrant phase transitions, assembly of nanoemulsions and the organization of nanoparticles into nanowires. Here, we report the synthesis of 6-nm nanoparticles with dynamic hydrophobic patches and show that they can form reversible self-assembled structures in aqueous solution that become topologically more connected upon dilution. The organization is based on guest&#8211;host supramolecular chemistry with the nanoparticles composed of a hydrophobic dendrimer host molecule and water-soluble hydrophilic guest molecules. The work demonstrates that subtle changes in hierarchal composition and/or concentration can dramatically change mesoscopic ordering.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Complex Molecular Systems, Eindhoven University of Technology, PO Box 513, Eindhoven, 5600, MB, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Thomas M.

letter,Strain engineering and one-dimensional organization of metal–insulator domains in single-crystal vanadium dioxide beams,"<p>Correlated electron materials can undergo a variety of phase transitions, including superconductivity, the metal&#8211;insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance. Moreover, multiple physical phases or domains with dimensions of nanometres to micrometres can coexist in these materials at temperatures where a pure phase is expected. Making use of the properties of correlated electron materials in device applications will require the ability to control domain structures and phase transitions in these materials. Lattice strain has been shown to cause the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases in the Mott insulator VO<sub>2</sub>. Here, we show that we can nucleate and manipulate ordered arrays of metallic and insulating domains along single-crystal beams of VO<sub>2</sub> by continuously tuning the strain over a wide range of values. The Mott transition between a low-temperature insulating phase and a high-temperature metallic phase usually occurs at 341&#160;K in VO<sub>2</sub>, but the active control of strain allows us to reduce this transition temperature to room temperature. In addition to device applications, the ability to control the phase structure of VO<sub>2</sub> with strain could lead to a deeper understanding of the correlated electron materials in general.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Selective and sensitive detection of metal ions by plasmonic resonance energy transfer-based nanospectroscopy,"<p>Highly selective and sensitive optical methods for the detection of metal ions have had a substantial impact on molecular biology, environmental monitoring and other areas of research. Here we demonstrate a new method for detecting metal ions that is based on selective plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) between conjugated metal&#8211;ligand complexes and a single gold nanoplasmonic probe. In addition to offering high spatial resolution due to the small size of the probe, our method is 100 to 1,000 times more sensitive than organic reporter-based methods.

letter,Inhaled carbon nanotubes reach the subpleural tissue in mice,"<p>Carbon nanotubes are shaped like fibres and can stimulate inflammation at the surface of the peritoneum when injected into the abdominal cavity of mice, raising concerns that inhaled nanotubes may cause pleural fibrosis and/or mesothelioma. Here, we show that multiwalled carbon nanotubes reach the subpleura in mice after a single inhalation exposure of 30&#160;mg&#160;m<sup>&#8722;3</sup> for 6&#160;h. Nanotubes were embedded in the subpleural wall and within subpleural macrophages. Mononuclear cell aggregates on the pleural surface increased in number and size after 1 day and nanotube-containing macrophages were observed within these foci. Subpleural fibrosis unique to this form of nanotubes increased after 2 and 6 weeks following inhalation. None of these effects was seen in mice that inhaled carbon black nanoparticles or a lower dose of nanotubes (1&#160;mg&#160;m<sup>&#8722;3</sup>).

article,Anticipating the perceived risk of nanotechnologies,"<p>Understanding emerging trends in public perceptions of nanomaterials is critically important for those who regulate risks. A number of surveys have explored public perceptions of their risks and benefits. In this paper we meta-analyse these surveys to assess the extent to which the following four hypotheses derived from previous studies of new technologies might be said to be valid for nanotechnologies: risk aversion will prevail over benefit appreciation; an increase in knowledge will not result in reduced aversion to risks; judgements will be malleable and subject to persuasion given risk-centric information; and contextual, psychometric and attitudinal predictors of perceived risk from prior studies can help anticipate future perceptions of nanotechnologies. We find that half the public has at least some familiarity with nanotechnology, and those who perceive greater benefits outnumber those who perceive greater risks by 3 to 1. However, a large minority of those surveyed (44%) is unsure, suggesting that risk judgements are highly malleable. Nanotechnology risk perceptions also appear to contradict some long-standing findings. In particular, unfamiliarity with nanotechnology is, contrary to expectations, not strongly associated with risk aversion and reduced &#8216;knowledge deficits&#8217; are correlated with positive perceptions in this early and controversy-free period. Psychometric variables, trust and affect continue to drive risk perceptions in this new context, although the influence of both trust and affect is mediated, even reversed, by demographic and cultural variables. Given the potential malleability of perceptions, novel methods for understanding future public responses to nanotechnologies will need to be developed.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6T 1Z4', 'authors': ['Terre Satterfield', '\xa0&\xa0Christian E.

article,All-electric quantum point contact spin-polarizer,"<p>The controlled creation, manipulation and detection of spin-polarized currents by purely electrical means remains a central challenge of spintronics. Efforts to meet this challenge by exploiting the coupling of the electron orbital motion to its spin, in particular Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling, have so far been unsuccessful. Recently, it has been shown theoretically that the confining potential of a small current-carrying wire with high intrinsic spin&#8211;orbit coupling leads to the accumulation of opposite spins at opposite edges of the wire, though not to a spin-polarized current. Here, we present experimental evidence that a quantum point contact&#8212;a short wire&#8212;made from a semiconductor with high intrinsic spin&#8211;orbit coupling can generate a completely spin-polarized current when its lateral confinement is made highly asymmetric. By avoiding the use of ferromagnetic contacts or external magnetic fields, such quantum point contacts may make feasible the development of a variety of semiconductor spintronic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, 45221, Ohio, USA', 'authors': ['P.

article,Translocation of double-stranded DNA through membrane-adapted phi29 motor protein nanopores,"<p>Biological pores have been used to study the transport of DNA and other molecules, but most pores have channels that allow only the movement of small molecules and single-stranded DNA and RNA. The bacteriophage phi29 DNA-packaging motor, which allows double-stranded DNA to enter the virus during maturation and exit during an infection, contains a connector protein with a channel that is between 3.6 and 6&#160;nm wide. Here we show that a modified version of this connector protein, when reconstituted into liposomes and inserted into planar lipid bilayers, allows the translocation of double-stranded DNA. The measured conductance of a single connector channel was 4.8&#160;nS in 1&#160;M KCl. This engineered and membrane-adapted phage connector is expected to have applications in microelectromechanical sensing, microreactors, gene delivery, drug loading and DNA sequencing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering and College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, 45267, Ohio, USA', 'authors': ['David Wendell', ',\xa0Peng Jing', ',\xa0Jia Geng', ',\xa0Varuni Subramaniam', ',\xa0Tae Jin Lee', ',\xa0Carlo Montemagno', '\xa0&\xa0Peixuan Guo']}, {'address': 'Vontz Center Rm 1301, 3125 Eden Avenue, Cincinnati, 45267-0508, Ohio, USA', 'authors': ['Peixuan Guo']}]",False,"['David Wendell', 'Peng Jing', 'Jia Geng', 'Varuni Subramaniam', 'Tae Jin Lee', 'Carlo Montemagno', 'Peixuan Guo']","Wendell, D., Jing, P., Geng, J. et al.

article,A route to brightly fluorescent carbon nanotubes for near-infrared imaging in mice,"<p>The near-infrared photoluminescence intrinsic to semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes is ideal for biological imaging owing to the low autofluorescence and deep tissue penetration in the near-infrared region beyond 1&#160;&#181;m. However, biocompatible single-walled carbon nanotubes with high quantum yield have been elusive. Here, we show that sonicating single-walled carbon nanotubes with sodium cholate, followed by surfactant exchange to form phospholipid&#8211;polyethylene glycol coated nanotubes, produces in vivo imaging agents that are both bright and biocompatible. The exchange procedure is better than directly sonicating the tubes with the phospholipid&#8211;polyethylene glycol, because it results in less damage to the nanotubes and improves the quantum yield. We show whole-animal in vivo imaging using an InGaAs camera in the 1&#8211;1.7&#160;&#181;m spectral range by detecting the intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence of the &#8216;exchange&#8217; single-walled carbon nanotubes at a low dose (17&#160;mg&#160;l<sup>&#8722;1</sup> injected dose).
