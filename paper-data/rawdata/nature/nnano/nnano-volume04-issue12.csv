review article,Nanotube electronics for radiofrequency applications,"<p>Electronic devices based on carbon nanotubes are among the candidates to eventually replace silicon-based devices for logic applications. Before then, however, nanotube-based radiofrequency transistors could become competitive for high-performance analogue components such as low-noise amplifiers and power amplifiers in wireless systems. Single-walled nanotubes are well suited for use in radiofrequency transistors because they demonstrate near-ballistic electron transport and are expected to have high cut-off frequencies. To achieve the best possible performance it is necessary to use dense arrays of semiconducting nanotubes with good alignment between the nanotubes, but techniques that can economically manufacture such arrays are needed to realize this potential. Here we review progress towards nanotube electronics for radiofrequency applications in terms of device physics, circuit design and the manufacturing challenges.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Departmental of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Integrated Nanosystems Research Facility, University of California, Irvine, 92697, California, USA', 'authors': ['Chris Rutherglen', ',\xa0Dheeraj Jain', '\xa0&\xa0Peter Burke']}]",False,"['Chris Rutherglen', 'Dheeraj Jain', 'Peter Burke']","Rutherglen, C., Jain, D. & Burke, P.

letter,Nanomechanical motion measured with an imprecision below that at the standard quantum limit,"<p>Nanomechanical oscillators are at the heart of ultrasensitive detectors of force, mass and motion. As these detectors progress to even better sensitivity, they will encounter measurement limits imposed by the laws of quantum mechanics. If the imprecision of a measurement of the displacement of an oscillator is pushed below a scale set by the standard quantum limit, the measurement must perturb the motion of the oscillator by an amount larger than that scale. Here we show a displacement measurement with an imprecision below the standard quantum limit scale. We achieve this imprecision by measuring the motion of a nanomechanical oscillator with a nearly shot-noise limited microwave interferometer. As the interferometer is naturally operated at cryogenic temperatures, the thermal motion of the oscillator is minimized, yielding an excellent force detector with a sensitivity of 0.51&#160;aN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>.

letter,Single-crystalline kinked semiconductor nanowire superstructures,"<p>The ability to control and modulate the composition, doping, crystal structure and morphology of semiconductor nanowires during the synthesis process has allowed researchers to explore various applications of nanowires. However, despite advances in nanowire synthesis, progress towards the ab initio design and growth of hierarchical nanostructures has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a &#8216;nanotectonic&#8217; approach that provides iterative control over the nucleation and growth of nanowires, and use it to grow kinked or zigzag nanowires in which the straight sections are separated by triangular joints. Moreover, the lengths of the straight sections can be controlled and the growth direction remains coherent along the nanowire. We also grow dopant-modulated structures in which specific device functions, including p&#8211;n diodes and field-effect transistors, can be precisely localized at the kinked junctions in the nanowires.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Bozhi Tian', ',\xa0Ping Xie', ',\xa0Thomas J.

letter,True solutions of single-walled carbon nanotubes for assembly into macroscopic materials,"<p>Translating the unique characteristics of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes into macroscopic materials such as fibres and sheets has been hindered by ineffective assembly. Fluid-phase assembly is particularly attractive, but the ability to dissolve nanotubes in solvents has eluded researchers for over a decade. Here, we show that single-walled nanotubes form true thermodynamic solutions in superacids, and report the full phase diagram, allowing the rational design of fluid-phase assembly processes. Single-walled nanotubes dissolve spontaneously in chlorosulphonic acid at weight concentrations of up to 0.5wt%, 1,000 times higher than previously reported in other acids. At higher concentrations, they form liquid-crystal phases that can be readily processed into fibres and sheets of controlled morphology.

letter,Atomic-scale mapping of quantum dots formed by droplet epitaxy,"<p>Quantum dots (QDs) have applications in optoelectronic devices, quantum information processing and energy harvesting. Although the droplet epitaxy fabrication method allows for a wide range of material combinations to be used, little is known about the growth mechanisms involved. Here we apply direct X-ray methods to derive sub-&#229;ngstr&#246;m resolution maps of QDs crystallized from indium droplets exposed to antimony, as well as their interface with a GaAs (100) substrate. We find that the QDs form coherently and extend a few unit cells below the substrate surface. This facilitates a droplet&#8211;substrate exchange of atoms, resulting in core&#8211;shell structures that contain a surprisingly small amount of In. The work provides the first atomic-scale mapping of the interface between epitaxial QDs and a substrate, and establishes the usefulness of X-ray phasing techniques for this and similar systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Applied Physics Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, Michigan, USA', 'authors': ['Divine P.

letter,Ultrafast graphene photodetector,"<p>Graphene research so far has focused on electronic rather than photonic applications, in spite of its impressive optical properties. These include its ability to absorb &#8764;2% of incident light over a broad wavelength range despite being just one atom thick. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast transistor-based photodetectors made from single- and few-layer graphene. The photoresponse does not degrade for optical intensity modulations up to 40&#160;GHz, and further analysis suggests that the intrinsic bandwidth may exceed 500&#160;GHz. The generation and transport of photocarriers in graphene differ fundamentally from those in photodetectors made from conventional semiconductors as a result of the unique photonic and electronic properties of the graphene. This leads to a remarkably high bandwidth, zero source&#8211;drain bias and dark current operation, and good internal quantum efficiency.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Thomas J.

letter,Programming the detection limits of biosensors through controlled nanostructuring,"<p>Advances in materials chemistry offer a range of nanostructured shapes and textures for building new biosensors. Previous reports have implied that controlling the properties of sensor substrates can improve detection sensitivities, but the evidence remains indirect. Here we show that by nanostructuring the sensing electrodes, it is possible to create nucleic acid sensors that have a broad range of sensitivities and that are capable of rapid analysis. Only highly branched electrodes with fine structuring attained attomolar sensitivity. Nucleic acid probes immobilized on finely nanostructured electrodes appear more accessible and therefore complex more rapidly with target molecules in solution. By forming arrays of microelectrodes with different degrees of nanostructuring, we expanded the dynamic range of a sensor system from two to six orders of magnitude.

letter,Self-assembled arrays of peptide nanotubes by vapour deposition,"<p>The use of bionanostructures in real-world applications will require precise control over biomolecular self-assembly and the ability to scale up production of these materials. A significant challenge is to control the formation of large, homogeneous arrays of bionanostructures on macroscopic surfaces. Previously, bionanostructure formation has been based on the spontaneous growth of heterogenic populations in bulk solution. Here, we demonstrate the self-assembly of large arrays of aromatic peptide nanotubes using vapour deposition methods. This approach allows the length and density of the nanotubes to be fine-tuned by carefully controlling the supply of the building blocks from the gas phase.

letter,In vivo magnetic enrichment and multiplex photoacoustic detection of circulating tumour cells,"<p>The spread of cancer cells between organs, a process known as metastasis, is the cause of most cancer deaths. Detecting circulating tumour cells&#8212;a common marker for the development of metastasis&#8212;is difficult because ex vivo methods are not sensitive enough owing to limited blood sample volume and in vivo diagnosis is time-consuming as large volumes of blood must be analysed. Here, we show a way to magnetically capture circulating tumour cells in the bloodstream of mice followed by rapid photoacoustic detection. Magnetic nanoparticles, which were functionalized to target a receptor commonly found in breast cancer cells, bound and captured circulating tumour cells under a magnet. To improve detection sensitivity and specificity, gold-plated carbon nanotubes conjugated with folic acid were used as a second contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging. By integrating in vivo multiplex targeting, magnetic enrichment, signal amplification and multicolour recognition, our approach allows circulating tumour cells to be concentrated from a large volume of blood in the vessels of tumour-bearing mice, and this could have potential for the early diagnosis of cancer and the prevention of metastasis in humans.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Phillips Classic Laser and Nanomedicine Laboratories, Winthrop P.

article,Performance of monolayer graphene nanomechanical resonators with electrical readout,"<p>The enormous stiffness and low density of graphene make it an ideal material for nanoelectromechanical applications. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and electrical readout of monolayer graphene resonators, and test their response to changes in mass and temperature. The devices show resonances in the megahertz range, and the strong dependence of resonant frequency on applied gate voltage can be fitted to a membrane model to yield the mass density and built-in strain of the graphene. Following the removal and addition of mass, changes in both density and strain are observed, indicating that adsorbates impart tension to the graphene. On cooling, the frequency increases, and the shift rate can be used to measure the unusual negative thermal expansion coefficient of graphene. The quality factor increases with decreasing temperature, reaching &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> at 5&#160;K. By establishing many of the basic attributes of monolayer graphene resonators, the groundwork for applications of these devices, including high-sensitivity mass detectors, is put in place.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA', 'authors': ['Changyao Chen', ',\xa0William Kalb', '\xa0&\xa0James Hone']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, USA', 'authors': ['Sami Rosenblatt', ',\xa0Ioannis Kymissis', '\xa0&\xa0Tony F.

article,Deterministic control of ferroelastic switching in multiferroic materials,"<p>Multiferroic materials showing coupled electric, magnetic and elastic orderings provide a platform to explore complexity and new paradigms for memory and logic devices. Until now, the deterministic control of non-ferroelectric order parameters in multiferroics has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate deterministic ferroelastic switching in rhombohedral BiFeO<sub>3</sub> by domain nucleation with a scanning probe. We are able to select among final states that have the same electrostatic energy, but differ dramatically in elastic or magnetic order, by applying voltage to the probe while it is in lateral motion. We also demonstrate the controlled creation of a ferrotoroidal order parameter. The ability to control local elastic, magnetic and torroidal order parameters with an electric field will make it possible to probe local strain and magnetic ordering, and engineer various magnetoelectric, domain-wall-based and strain-coupled devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'The Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, 37831, Tennessee, USA', 'authors': ['N.

article,Nanoparticles can cause DNA damage across a cellular barrier,"<p>The increasing use of nanoparticles in medicine has raised concerns over their ability to gain access to privileged sites in the body. Here, we show that cobalt&#8211;chromium nanoparticles (29.5&#160;&#177;&#160;6.3&#160;nm in diameter) can damage human fibroblast cells across an intact cellular barrier without having to cross the barrier. The damage is mediated by a novel mechanism involving transmission of purine nucleotides (such as ATP) and intercellular signalling within the barrier through connexin gap junctions or hemichannels and pannexin channels. The outcome, which includes DNA damage without significant cell death, is different from that observed in cells subjected to direct exposure to nanoparticles. Our results suggest the importance of indirect effects when evaluating the safety of nanoparticles. The potential damage to tissues located behind cellular barriers needs to be considered when using nanoparticles for targeting diseased states.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Bristol Implant Research Centre, Southmead Hospital, Bristol, BS10 5NB, UK', 'authors': ['Gevdeep Bhabra', ',\xa0Aman Sood', ',\xa0Brenton Fisher', '\xa0&\xa0Charles Patrick Case']}, {'address': 'Department of Medical Physics & Bioengineering, Biophysics Research Unit, Bristol Haematology & Oncology Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Horfield Road, Bristol, BS2 8ED, UK', 'authors': ['Laura Cartwright', '\xa0&\xa0Margaret Saunders']}, {'address': 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Immunology & Wales Heart Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, CF14 4XN', 'authors': ['William Howard Evans']}, {'address': 'Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Michael Smith Building, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK', 'authors': ['Annmarie Surprenant', '\xa0&\xa0Gloria Lopez-Castejon']}, {'address': 'School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1TS, UK', 'authors': ['Stephen Mann', ',\xa0Sean A.
