Self-assembly has emerged as a powerful technique for controlling the structure and properties of ensembles of inorganic nanoparticles.

letter,Efficient narrow-band light emission from a single carbon nanotube p–n diode,"<p>Electrically driven light emission from carbon nanotubes could be used in nanoscale lasers and single-photon sources, and has therefore been the focus of much research. However, high electric fields and currents have either been necessary for electroluminescence, or have been an undesired side effect, leading to high power requirements and low efficiencies. Furthermore, electroluminescent linewidths have been broad enough to obscure the contributions of individual optical transitions. Here, we report electrically induced light emission from individual carbon nanotube p&#8211;n diodes. A new level of control over electrical carrier injection is achieved, reducing power dissipation by a factor of up to 1,000, and resulting in zero threshold current, negligible self-heating and high carrier-to-photon conversion efficiencies. Moreover, the electroluminescent spectra are significantly narrower (&#8764;35 meV) than in previous studies, allowing the identification of emission from free and localized excitons.</p>",[],False,"[""Thomas Mueller"", ""Megumi Kinoshita"", ""Mathias Steiner"", ""Vasili Perebeinos"", ""Ageeth A.

They have been observed in a variety of systems. Here, we report a many-body Fano resonance in bilayer graphene that is continuously tunable by means of electrical gating. Discrete phonons and continuous exciton (electron&#8211;hole pair) transitions are coupled by electron&#8211;phonon interactions, yielding a new hybrid phonon&#8211;exciton excited state.

letter,Ferromagnetic domain nucleation and growth in colossal magnetoresistive manganite,"<p>Colossal magnetoresistance is a dramatic decrease in resistivity caused by applied magnetic fields, and has been the focus of much research because of its potential for magnetic data storage using materials such as manganites. Although extensive microscopy and theoretical studies have shown that colossal magnetoresistance involves competing insulating and ferromagnetic conductive phases, the mechanism underlying the effect remains unclear. Here, by directly observing magnetic domain walls and flux distributions using cryogenic Lorentz microscopy and electron holography, we demonstrate that an applied magnetic field assists nucleation and growth of an ordered ferromagnetic phase. These results provide new insights into the evolution dynamics of complex domain structures at the nanoscale, and help to explain anomalous phase separation phenomena that are relevant for applications. Our approach can also be used to determine magnetic parameters of nanoscale regions, such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy and exchange stiffness, without bulk magnetization results or neutron scattering data.</p>",[],False,"[""Y.

letter,Design considerations for tumour-targeted nanoparticles,"<p>Inorganic/organic hybrid nanoparticles are potentially useful in biomedicine, but to avoid non-specific background fluorescence and long-term toxicity, they need to be cleared from the body within a reasonable timescale. Previously, we have shown that rigid spherical nanoparticles such as quantum dots can be cleared by the kidneys if they have a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 5.5&#160;nm and a zwitterionic surface charge. Here, we show that quantum dots functionalized with high-affinity small-molecule ligands that target tumours can also be cleared by the kidneys if their hydrodynamic diameter is less than this value, which sets an upper limit of 5&#8211;10 ligands per quantum dot for renal clearance. Animal models of prostate cancer and melanoma show receptor-specific imaging and renal clearance within 4&#160;h post-injection. This study suggests a set of design rules for the clinical translation of targeted nanoparticles that can be eliminated through the kidneys.</p>",[],False,"[""Hak Soo Choi"", ""Wenhao Liu"", ""Fangbing Liu"", ""Khaled Nasr"", ""Preeti Misra"", ""Moungi G.

letter,A novel intracellular protein delivery platform based on single-protein nanocapsules,"<p>An average cell contains thousands of proteins that participate in normal cellular functions, and most diseases are somehow related to the malfunctioning of one or more of these proteins. Protein therapy, which delivers proteins into the cell to replace the dysfunctional protein, is considered the most direct and safe approach for treating disease. However, the effectiveness of this method has been limited by its low delivery efficiency and poor stability against proteases in the cell, which digest the protein. Here, we show a novel delivery platform based on nanocapsules consisting of a protein core and a thin permeable polymeric shell that can be engineered to either degrade or remain stable at different pHs. Non-degradable capsules show long-term stability, whereas the degradable ones break down their shells, enabling the core protein to be active once inside the cells. Multiple proteins can be delivered to cells with high efficiency while maintaining low toxicity, suggesting potential applications in imaging, therapy and cosmetics fields.</p>",[],False,"[""Ming Yan"", ""Juanjuan Du"", ""Zhen Gu"", ""Min Liang"", ""Yufang Hu"", ""Wenjun Zhang"", ""Saul Priceman"", ""Lily Wu"", ""Z.

article,Dispersed nanoelectrode devices,"<p>The enhanced performance and reduced scale that nanoparticles can bring to a device are frequently compromised by the poor electrical conductivity of nanoparticle structures or assemblies. Here, we demonstrate a unique nanoscale electrode assembly in which conduction is carried out by one set of nanoparticles, and other device functions by another set. Using a scalable process, nanoparticles with tailored conductivity are stochastically deposited above or below a functional nanoparticle film, and serve as extensions of the bulk electrodes, greatly reducing the total film resistance. We apply this approach to solid-state gas sensors and achieve controlled device resistance with an exceptionally high sensitivity to ethanol of 20 ppb. This approach can be extended to other classes of devices such as actuators, batteries, and fuel and solar cells.</p>",[],False,"[""Antonio Tricoli"", ""Sotiris E.

article,Self-assembly of carbon nanotubes into two-dimensional geometries using DNA origami templates,"<p>A central challenge in nanotechnology is the parallel fabrication of complex geometries for nanodevices. Here we report a general method for arranging single-walled carbon nanotubes in two dimensions using DNA origami&#8212;a technique in which a long single strand of DNA is folded into a predetermined shape. We synthesize rectangular origami templates (&#8764;75 nm &#215; 95 nm) that display two lines of single-stranded DNA &#8216;hooks&#8217; in a cross pattern with &#8764;6 nm resolution. The perpendicular lines of hooks serve as sequence-specific binding sites for two types of nanotubes, each functionalized non-covalently with a distinct DNA linker molecule. The hook-binding domain of each linker is protected to ensure efficient hybridization. When origami templates and DNA-functionalized nanotubes are mixed, strand displacement-mediated deprotection and binding aligns the nanotubes into cross-junctions. Of several cross-junctions synthesized by this method, one demonstrated stable field-effect transistor-like behaviour. In such organizations of electronic components, DNA origami serves as a programmable nanobreadboard; thus, DNA origami may allow the rapid prototyping of complex nanotube-based structures.</p>",[],False,"[""Hareem T.

By combining these techniques, a range of complementary information could be simultaneously obtained at a single molecule level. Here, we report the design, fabrication and application of a photonic&#8211;plasmonic device that is fully compatible with atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our approach relies on the generation and localization of surface plasmon polaritons by means of adiabatic compression through a metallic tapered waveguide to create strongly enhanced Raman excitation in a region just a few nanometres across. The tapered waveguide can also be used as an atomic force microscope tip.

article,Self-organized photosynthetic nanoparticle for cell-free hydrogen production,"<p>There is considerable interest in making use of solar energy through photosynthesis to create alternative forms of fuel.

The self-organized platinization of the photosystem I nanoparticles allows electron transport from sodium ascorbate to photosystem I via cytochrome-c<sub>6</sub> and finally to the platinum catalyst, where hydrogen gas is formed. Our system produces hydrogen at temperatures up to 55 &#176;C and is temporally stable for &gt;85 days with no decrease in hydrogen yield when tested intermittently.

article,Effective repair of traumatically injured spinal cord by nanoscale block copolymer micelles,"<p>Spinal cord injury results in immediate disruption of neuronal membranes, followed by extensive secondary neurodegenerative processes. A key approach for repairing injured spinal cord is to seal the damaged membranes at an early stage. Here, we show that axonal membranes injured by compression can be effectively repaired using self-assembled monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(d,l-lactic acid) di-block copolymer micelles. Injured spinal tissue incubated with micelles (60&#160;nm diameter) showed rapid restoration of compound action potential and reduced calcium influx into axons for micelle concentrations much lower than the concentrations of polyethylene glycol, a known sealing agent for early-stage spinal cord injury.
