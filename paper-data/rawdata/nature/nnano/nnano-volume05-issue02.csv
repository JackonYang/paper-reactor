letter,New modes for subsurface atomic force microscopy through nanomechanical coupling,"<p>Non-destructive, nanoscale characterization techniques are needed to understand both synthetic and biological materials. The atomic force microscope uses a force-sensing cantilever with a sharp tip to measure the topography and other properties of surfaces. As the tip is scanned over the surface it experiences attractive and repulsive forces that depend on the chemical and mechanical properties of the sample. Here we show that an atomic force microscope can obtain a range of surface and subsurface information by making use of the nonlinear nanomechanical coupling between the probe and the sample. This technique, which is called mode-synthesizing atomic force microscopy, relies on multi-harmonic forcing of the sample and the probe. A rich spectrum of first- and higher-order couplings is discovered, providing a multitude of new operational modes for force microscopy, and the capabilities of the technique are demonstrated by examining nanofabricated samples and plant cells.</p>",[],False,"[""L.

letter,Highly conductive self-assembled nanoribbons of coordination polymers,"<p>Organic molecules can self-assemble into well-ordered structures, but the conductance of these structures is limited, which is a disadvantage for applications in molecular electronics. Conductivity can be improved by using coordination polymers&#8212;in which metal centres are incorporated into a molecular backbone&#8212;and such structures have been used as molecular wires by self-assembling them into ordered films on metal surfaces. Here, we report electrically conductive nanoribbons of the coordination polymer [Pt<sub>2</sub>I(S<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sub>n</sub> self-assembled on an insulating substrate by direct sublimation of polymer crystals. Conductance atomic force microscopy is used to probe the electrical characteristics of a few polymer chains (&#8764;10) within the nanoribbons. The observed currents exceed those previously sustained in organic and metal&#8211;organic molecules assembled on surfaces by several orders of magnitude and over much longer distances.

letter,Switching binary states of nanoparticle superlattices and dimer clusters by DNA strands,"<p>Nanoscale components can be self-assembled into static three-dimensional structures, arrays and clusters using biomolecular motifs. The structural plasticity of biomolecules and the reversibility of their interactions can also be used to make nanostructures that are dynamic, reconfigurable and responsive. DNA has emerged as an ideal biomolecular motif for making such nanostructures, partly because its versatile morphology permits in situ conformational changes using molecular stimuli. This has allowed DNA nanostructures to exhibit reconfigurable topologies and mechanical movement. Recently, researchers have begun to translate this approach to nanoparticle interfaces, where, for example, the distances between nanoparticles can be modulated, resulting in a distance-dependent plasmonic response. Here, we report the assembly of nanoparticles into three-dimensional superlattices and dimer clusters, using a reconfigurable DNA device that acts as an interparticle linkage. The interparticle distances in the superlattices and clusters can be modified, while preserving structural integrity, by adding molecular stimuli (simple DNA strands) after the self-assembly processes has been completed. Both systems were found to switch between two distinct rigid states, but a transition to a flexible device configuration within a superlattice showed a significant hysteresis.</p>",[],False,"[""Mathew M.

letter,Large-area spatially ordered arrays of gold nanoparticles directed by lithographically confined DNA origami,"<p>The development of nanoscale electronic and photonic devices will require a combination of the high throughput of lithographic patterning and the high resolution and chemical precision afforded by self-assembly. However, the incorporation of nanomaterials with dimensions of less than 10&#160;nm into functional devices has been hindered by the disparity between their size and the 100&#160;nm feature sizes that can be routinely generated by lithography. Biomolecules offer a bridge between the two size regimes, with sub-10&#160;nm dimensions, synthetic flexibility and a capability for self-recognition. Here, we report the directed assembly of 5-nm gold particles into large-area, spatially ordered, two-dimensional arrays through the site-selective deposition of mesoscopic DNA origami onto lithographically patterned substrates and the precise binding of gold nanocrystals to each DNA structure. We show organization with registry both within an individual DNA template and between components on neighbouring DNA origami, expanding the generality of this method towards many types of patterns and sizes.</p>",[],False,"[""Albert M.

letter,Colloidal lenses allow high-temperature single-molecule imaging and improve fluorophore photostability,"<p>Although single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy was first demonstrated at near-absolute zero temperatures (1.8&#160;K), the field has since advanced to include room-temperature observations, largely owing to the use of objective lenses with high numerical aperture, brighter fluorophores and more sensitive detectors. This has opened the door for many chemical and biological systems to be studied at native temperatures at the single-molecule level both in vitro and in vivo. However, it is difficult to study systems and phenomena at temperatures above 37&#160;&#176;C, because the index-matching fluids used with high-numerical-aperture objective lenses can conduct heat from the sample to the lens, and sustained exposure to high temperatures can cause the lens to fail. Here, we report that TiO<sub>2</sub> colloids with diameters of 2&#160;&#181;m and a high refractive index can act as lenses that are capable of single-molecule imaging at 70&#160;&#176;C when placed in immediate proximity to an emitting molecule. The optical system is completed by a low-numerical-aperture optic that can have a long working distance and an air interface, which allows the sample to be independently heated. Colloidal lenses were used for parallel imaging of surface-immobilized single fluorophores and for real-time single-molecule measurements of mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes at 70&#160;&#176;C. Fluorophores in close proximity to TiO<sub>2</sub> also showed a 40% increase in photostability due to a reduction of the excited-state lifetime.</p>",[],False,"[""Jerrod J.

letter,Single-donor ionization energies in a nanoscale CMOS channel,"<p>One consequence of the continued downward scaling of transistors is the reliance on only a few discrete atoms to dope the channel, and random fluctuations in the number of these dopants are already a major issue in the microelectronics industry. Although single dopant signatures have been observed at low temperatures, the impact on transistor performance of a single dopant atom at room temperature is not well understood. Here, we show that a single arsenic dopant atom dramatically affects the off-state room-temperature behaviour of a short-channel field-effect transistor fabricated with standard microelectronics processes. The ionization energy of the dopant is measured to be much larger than it is in bulk, due to its proximity to the buried oxide, and this explains the large current below threshold and large variability in ultra-scaled transistors. The results also suggest a path to incorporating quantum functionalities into silicon CMOS devices through manipulation of single donor orbitals.</p>",[],False,"[""M. Pierre"", ""R. Wacquez"", ""X.

letter,Label-free biomarker detection from whole blood,"<p>Label-free nanosensors can detect disease markers to provide point-of-care diagnosis that is low-cost, rapid, specific and sensitive. However, detecting these biomarkers in physiological fluid samples is difficult because of problems such as biofouling and non-specific binding, and the resulting need to use purified buffers greatly reduces the clinical relevance of these sensors. Here, we overcome this limitation by using distinct components within the sensor to perform purification and detection. A microfluidic purification chip simultaneously captures multiple biomarkers from blood samples and releases them, after washing, into purified buffer for sensing by a silicon nanoribbon detector. This two-stage approach isolates the detector from the complex environment of whole blood, and reduces its minimum required sensitivity by effectively pre-concentrating the biomarkers. We show specific and quantitative detection of two model cancer antigens from a 10&#160;&#181;l sample of whole blood in less than 20&#160;min.

article,Above-bandgap voltages from ferroelectric photovoltaic devices,"<p>In conventional solid-state photovoltaics, electron&#8211;hole pairs are created by light absorption in a semiconductor and separated by the electric field spaning a micrometre-thick depletion region. The maximum voltage these devices can produce is equal to the semiconductor electronic bandgap. Here, we report the discovery of a fundamentally different mechanism for photovoltaic charge separation, which operates over a distance of 1&#8211;2&#160;nm and produces voltages that are significantly higher than the bandgap. The separation happens at previously unobserved nanoscale steps of the electrostatic potential that naturally occur at ferroelectric domain walls in the complex oxide BiFeO<sub>3</sub>. Electric-field control over domain structure allows the photovoltaic effect to be reversed in polarity or turned off.

article,Atomic structure of conducting nanofilaments in TiO2 resistive switching memory,"<p>Resistance switching in metal oxides could form the basis for next-generation non-volatile memory. It has been argued that the current in the high-conductivity state of several technologically relevant oxide materials flows through localized filaments, but these filaments have been characterized only indirectly, limiting our understanding of the switching mechanism. Here, we use high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to probe directly the nanofilaments in a Pt/TiO<sub>2</sub>/Pt system during resistive switching. In situ current&#8211;voltage and low-temperature (&#8764;130 K) conductivity measurements confirm that switching occurs by the formation and disruption of Ti<sub>n</sub>O<sub>2n&#8722;1</sub> (or so-called Magn&#233;li phase) filaments.

article,Electrically controlled DNA adhesion,"<p>The ability to control the interaction of polyelectrolytes, such as DNA or proteins, with charged surfaces is of pivotal importance for a multitude of biotechnological applications. Previously, we measured the desorption forces of single polymers on charged surfaces using an atomic force microscope. Here, we show that the adhesion of DNA on gold electrodes modified with self-assembled monolayers can be biased by the composition of the monolayer and externally controlled by means of the electrode potential. Positive potentials induced DNA adsorption onto OH-terminated electrodes with adhesion forces up to 25&#160;pN (at +0.5&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl), whereas negative potentials suppressed DNA adsorption. The measured contributions of the DNA backbone phosphate charges and the doubly charged terminal phosphate on adsorption agreed with a model based on the Gouy&#8211;Chapman theory.

article,Electrostatic focusing of unlabelled DNA into nanoscale pores using a salt gradient,"<p>Solid-state nanopores are sensors capable of analysing individual unlabelled DNA molecules in solution. Although the critical information obtained from nanopores (for example, DNA sequence) comes from the signal collected during DNA translocation, the throughput of the method is determined by the rate at which molecules arrive and thread into the pores. Here, we study the process of DNA capture into nanofabricated SiN pores of molecular dimensions. For fixed analyte concentrations we find an increase in capture rate as the DNA length increases from 800 to 8,000 base pairs, a length-independent capture rate for longer molecules, and increasing capture rates when ionic gradients are established across the pore. Furthermore, we show that application of a 20-fold salt gradient allows the detection of picomolar DNA concentrations at high throughput. The salt gradients enhance the electric field, focusing more molecules into the pore, thereby advancing the possibility of analysing unamplified DNA samples using nanopores.</p>",[],False,"[""Meni Wanunu"", ""Will Morrison"", ""Yitzhak Rabin"", ""Alexander Y.
