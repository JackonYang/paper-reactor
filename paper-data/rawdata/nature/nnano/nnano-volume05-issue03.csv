letter,Ultralow nanoscale wear through atom-by-atom attrition in silicon-containing diamond-like carbon,"<p>Understanding friction and wear at the nanoscale is important for many applications that involve nanoscale components sliding on a surface, such as nanolithography, nanometrology and nanomanufacturing. Defects, cracks and other phenomena that influence material strength and wear at macroscopic scales are less important at the nanoscale, which is why nanowires can, for example, show higher strengths than bulk samples. The contact area between the materials must also be described differently at the nanoscale. Diamond-like carbon is routinely used as a surface coating in applications that require low friction and wear because it is resistant to wear at the macroscale, but there has been considerable debate about the wear mechanisms of diamond-like carbon at the nanoscale because it is difficult to fabricate diamond-like carbon structures with nanoscale fidelity. Here, we demonstrate the batch fabrication of ultrasharp diamond-like carbon tips that contain significant amounts of silicon on silicon microcantilevers for use in atomic force microscopy. This material is known to possess low friction in humid conditions, and we find that, at the nanoscale, it is three orders of magnitude more wear-resistant than silicon under ambient conditions. A wear rate of one atom per micrometre of sliding on SiO<sub>2</sub> is demonstrated. We find that the classical wear law of Archard does not hold at the nanoscale; instead, atom-by-atom attrition dominates the wear mechanisms at these length scales. We estimate that the effective energy barrier for the removal of a single atom is &#8764;1 eV, with an effective activation volume of &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;28</sup>&#160;m.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Research - Zurich, Rüschlikon, 8803, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Harish Bhaskaran', ',\xa0Bernd Gotsmann', ',\xa0Abu Sebastian', ',\xa0Ute Drechsler', ',\xa0Mark A.

letter,Towards a quantum resistance standard based on epitaxial graphene,"<p>The quantum Hall effect allows the international standard for resistance to be defined in terms of the electron charge and Planck's constant alone. The effect comprises the quantization of the Hall resistance in two-dimensional electron systems in rational fractions of R<sub>K</sub>&#160;=&#160;h/e<sup>2</sup>&#160;=&#160;25&#160;812.807&#160;557(18) &#937;, the resistance quantum. Despite 30 years of research into the quantum Hall effect, the level of precision necessary for metrology&#8212;a few parts per billion&#8212;has been achieved only in silicon and iii&#8211;v heterostructure devices. Graphene should, in principle, be an ideal material for a quantum resistance standard, because it is inherently two-dimensional and its discrete electron energy levels in a magnetic field (the Landau levels) are widely spaced. However, the precisions demonstrated so far have been lower than one part per million. Here, we report a quantum Hall resistance quantization accuracy of three parts per billion in monolayer epitaxial graphene at 300&#160;mK, four orders of magnitude better than previously reported. Moreover, by demonstrating the structural integrity and uniformity of graphene over hundreds of micrometres, as well as reproducible mobility and carrier concentrations across a half-centimetre wafer, these results boost the prospects of using epitaxial graphene in applications beyond quantum metrology.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, TW11 0LW, UK', 'authors': ['Alexander Tzalenchuk', ',\xa0Olga Kazakova', '\xa0&\xa0T.

letter,Graphene nanomesh,"<p>Graphene has significant potential for application in electronics, but cannot be used for effective field-effect transistors operating at room temperature because it is a semimetal with a zero bandgap. Processing graphene sheets into nanoribbons with widths of less than 10&#160;nm can open up a bandgap that is large enough for room-temperature transistor operation, but nanoribbon devices often have low driving currents or transconductances. Moreover, practical devices and circuits will require the production of dense arrays of ordered nanoribbons, which remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the production of a new graphene nanostructure&#8212;which we call a graphene nanomesh&#8212;that can open up a bandgap in a large sheet of graphene to create a semiconducting thin film. The nanomeshes are prepared using block copolymer lithography and can have variable periodicities and neck widths as low as 5&#160;nm. Graphene nanomesh field-effect transistors can support currents nearly 100 times greater than individual graphene nanoribbon devices, and the on&#8211;off ratio, which is comparable with the values achieved in individual nanoribbon devices, can be tuned by varying the neck width. The block copolymer lithography approach used to make the nanomesh devices is intrinsically scalable and could allow for the rational design and fabrication of graphene-based devices and circuits with standard semiconductor processing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA', 'authors': ['Jingwei Bai', '\xa0&\xa0Yu Huang']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA', 'authors': ['Xing Zhong', ',\xa0Shan Jiang', '\xa0&\xa0Xiangfeng Duan']}, {'address': 'California Nanosystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA', 'authors': ['Yu Huang', '\xa0&\xa0Xiangfeng Duan']}]",False,"['Jingwei Bai', 'Xing Zhong', 'Shan Jiang', 'Yu Huang', 'Xiangfeng Duan']","Bai, J., Zhong, X., Jiang, S. et al.

letter,A diamond nanowire single-photon source,"<p>The development of a robust light source that emits one photon at a time will allow new technologies such as secure communication through quantum cryptography. Devices based on fluorescent dye molecules, quantum dots and carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated, but none has combined a high single-photon flux with stable, room-temperature operation. Luminescent centres in diamond have recently emerged as a stable alternative, and, in the case of nitrogen-vacancy centres, offer spin quantum bits with optical readout. However, these luminescent centres in bulk diamond crystals have the disadvantage of low photon out-coupling. Here, we demonstrate a single-photon source composed of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in a diamond nanowire, which produces ten times greater flux than bulk diamond devices, while using ten times less power. This result enables a new class of devices for photonic and quantum information processing based on nanostructured diamond, and could have a broader impact in nanoelectromechanical systems, sensing and scanning probe microscopy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Engineering and Applied Science, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Thomas M.

letter,Single-molecule chemical reactions on DNA origami,"<p>DNA nanotechnology and particularly DNA origami, in which long, single-stranded DNA molecules are folded into predetermined shapes, can be used to form complex self-assembled nanostructures.

Relatively large nanocomponents such as nanoparticles and biomolecules can also be integrated into DNA nanostructures and imaged. Here, we show that chemical reactions with single molecules can be performed and imaged at a local position on a DNA origami scaffold by atomic force microscopy.

letter,Nanostructured films from hierarchical self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins,"<p>In nature, sophisticated functional materials are created through hierarchical self-assembly of simple nanoscale motifs. In the laboratory, much progress has been made in the controlled assembly of molecules into one-, two- and three-dimensional artificial nanostructures, but bridging from the nanoscale to the macroscale to create useful macroscopic materials remains a challenge. Here we show a scalable self-assembly approach to making free-standing films from amyloid protein fibrils. The films were well ordered and highly rigid, with a Young's modulus of up to 5&#8211;7&#160;GPa, which is comparable to the highest values for proteinaceous materials found in nature. We show that the self-organizing protein scaffolds can align otherwise unstructured components (such as fluorophores) within the macroscopic films.

letter,High-speed atomic force microscopy shows dynamic molecular processes in photoactivated bacteriorhodopsin,"<p>Dynamic changes in protein conformation in response to external stimuli are important in biological processes, but it has proved difficult to directly visualize such structural changes under physiological conditions. Here, we show that high-speed atomic force microscopy can be used to visualize dynamic changes in stimulated proteins. High-resolution movies of a light-driven proton pump, bacteriorhodopsin, reveal that, upon illumination, a cytoplasmic portion of each bacteriorhodopsin monomer is brought into contact with adjacent trimers. The bacteriorhodopsin&#8211;bacteriorhodopsin interaction in the transiently formed assembly engenders both positive and negative cooperative effects in the decay kinetics as the initial bacteriorhodopsin recovers and, as a consequence, the turnover rate of the photocycle is maintained constant, on average, irrespective of the light intensity.

letter,Engineered biological nanofactories trigger quorum sensing response in targeted bacteria,"<p>Biological nanofactories, which are engineered to contain modules that can target, sense and synthesize molecules, can trigger communication between different bacterial populations. These communications influence biofilm formation, virulence, bioluminescence and many other bacterial functions in a process called quorum sensing. Here, we show the assembly of a nanofactory that can trigger a bacterial quorum sensing response in the absence of native quorum molecules. The nanofactory comprises an antibody (for targeting) and a fusion protein that produces quorum molecules when bound to the targeted bacterium. Our nanofactory selectively targets the appropriate bacteria and triggers a quorum sensing response when added to two populations of bacteria. The nanofactories also trigger communication between two bacterial populations that are otherwise non-communicating. We envision the use of these nanofactories in generating new antimicrobial treatments that target the communication networks of bacteria rather than their viability.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Fischell Department of Bioengineering, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742, Maryland, USA', 'authors': ['Rohan Fernandes', ',\xa0Hsuan-Chen Wu', '\xa0&\xa0William E.

article,Cold welding of ultrathin gold nanowires,"<p>The welding of metals at the nanoscale is likely to have an important role in the bottom-up fabrication of electrical and mechanical nanodevices. Existing welding techniques use local heating, requiring precise control of the heating mechanism and introducing the possibility of damage. The welding of metals without heating (or cold welding) has been demonstrated, but only at macroscopic length scales and under large applied pressures. Here, we demonstrate that single-crystalline gold nanowires with diameters between 3 and 10&#160;nm can be cold-welded together within seconds by mechanical contact alone, and under relatively low applied pressures. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and in situ measurements reveal that the welds are nearly perfect, with the same crystal orientation, strength and electrical conductivity as the rest of the nanowire. The high quality of the welds is attributed to the nanoscale sample dimensions, oriented-attachment mechanisms and mechanically assisted fast surface-atom diffusion. Welds are also demonstrated between gold and silver, and silver and silver, indicating that the technique may be generally applicable.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Rice University, Houston, 77005, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Yang Lu', '\xa0&\xa0Jun Lou']}, {'address': 'Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT), Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, 87185, New Mexico, USA', 'authors': ['Jian Yu Huang']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Division of Engineering, Brown University, Providence, 02912, Rhode Island, USA', 'authors': ['Chao Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Shouheng Sun']}]",False,"['Yang Lu', 'Jian Yu Huang', 'Chao Wang', 'Shouheng Sun', 'Jun Lou']","Lu, Y., Huang, J., Wang, C. et al.

article,Nanowire transistors without junctions,"<p>All existing transistors are based on the use of semiconductor junctions formed by introducing dopant atoms into the semiconductor material. As the distance between junctions in modern devices drops below 10&#160;nm, extraordinarily high doping concentration gradients become necessary. Because of the laws of diffusion and the statistical nature of the distribution of the doping atoms, such junctions represent an increasingly difficult fabrication challenge for the semiconductor industry. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new type of transistor in which there are no junctions and no doping concentration gradients. These devices have full CMOS functionality and are made using silicon nanowires. They have near-ideal subthreshold slope, extremely low leakage currents, and less degradation of mobility with gate voltage and temperature than classical transistors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Tyndall National Institute, University College Cork, Lee Maltings, Cork, Ireland', 'authors': ['Jean-Pierre Colinge', ',\xa0Chi-Woo Lee', ',\xa0Aryan Afzalian', ',\xa0Nima Dehdashti Akhavan', ',\xa0Ran Yan', ',\xa0Isabelle Ferain', ',\xa0Pedram Razavi', "",\xa0Brendan O'Neill"", ',\xa0Alan Blake', ',\xa0Mary White', ',\xa0Anne-Marie Kelleher', ',\xa0Brendan McCarthy', '\xa0&\xa0Richard Murphy']}]",False,"['Jean-Pierre Colinge', 'Chi-Woo Lee', 'Aryan Afzalian', 'Nima Dehdashti Akhavan', 'Ran Yan', 'Isabelle Ferain', 'Pedram Razavi', ""Brendan O'Neill"", 'Alan Blake', 'Mary White', 'Anne-Marie Kelleher', 'Brendan McCarthy', 'Richard Murphy']","Colinge, J., Lee, C., Afzalian, A. et al.

article,An inorganic–organic proton exchange membrane for fuel cells with a controlled nanoscale pore structure,"<p>Proton exchange membrane fuel cells have the potential for applications in energy conversion and energy storage, but their development has been impeded by problems with the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate that a silicon-based inorganic&#8211;organic membrane offers a number of advantages over Nafion&#8212;the membrane widely used as a proton exchange membrane in hydrogen fuel cells&#8212;including higher proton conductivity, a lack of volumetric size change, and membrane electrode assembly construction capabilities. Key to achieving these advantages is fabricating a silicon membrane with pores with diameters of &#8764;5&#8211;7 nm, adding a self-assembled molecular monolayer on the pore surface, and then capping the pores with a layer of porous silica. The silica layer reduces the diameter of the pores and ensures their hydration, resulting in a proton conductivity that is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of Nafion at low humidity. A membrane electrode assembly constructed with this proton exchange membrane delivered an order of magnitude higher power density than that achieved previously with a dry hydrogen feed and an air-breathing cathode.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Saeed Moghaddam', ',\xa0Richard I.
