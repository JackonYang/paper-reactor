letter,Polyethylene nanofibres with very high thermal conductivities,"<p>Bulk polymers are generally regarded as thermal insulators, and typically have thermal conductivities on the order of 0.1&#160;W&#160;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;K<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (ref.&#160;). However, recent work suggests that individual chains of polyethylene&#8212;the simplest and most widely used polymer&#8212;can have extremely high thermal conductivity. Practical applications of these polymers may also require that the individual chains form fibres or films. Here, we report the fabrication of high-quality ultra-drawn polyethylene nanofibres with diameters of 50&#8211;500 nm and lengths up to tens of millimetres. The thermal conductivity of the nanofibres was found to be as high as &#8764;104 W m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;K<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is larger than the conductivities of about half of the pure metals. The high thermal conductivity is attributed to the restructuring of the polymer chains by stretching, which improves the fibre quality toward an &#8216;ideal&#8217; single crystalline fibre. Such thermally conductive polymers are potentially useful as heat spreaders and could supplement conventional metallic heat-transfer materials, which are used in applications such as solar hot-water collectors, heat exchangers and electronic packaging.</p>",[],False,"[""Sheng Shen"", ""Asegun Henry"", ""Jonathan Tong"", ""Ruiting Zheng"", ""Gang Chen""]","Shen, S., Henry, A., Tong, J. et al.

letter,Complex self-assembled patterns using sparse commensurate templates with locally varying motifs,"<p>Templated self-assembly of block copolymer thin films can generate periodic arrays of microdomains within a sparse template, or complex patterns using 1:1 templates. However, arbitrary pattern generation directed by sparse templates remains elusive. Here, we show that an array of carefully spaced and shaped posts, prepared by electron-beam patterning of an inorganic resist, can be used to template complex patterns in a cylindrical-morphology block copolymer. We use two distinct methods: making the post spacing commensurate with the equilibrium periodicity of the polymer, which controls the orientation of the linear features, and making local changes to the shape or distribution of the posts, which direct the formation of bends, junctions and other aperiodic features in specific locations. The first of these methods permits linear patterns to be directed by a sparse template that occupies only a few percent of the area of the final self-assembled pattern, while the second method can be used to selectively and locally template complex linear patterns.</p>",[],False,"[""Joel K.

letter,Superconductivity in just four pairs of (BETS)2GaCl4 molecules,"<p>How small can a sample of superconducting material be and still display superconductivity? This question is relevant to our fundamental understanding of superconductivity, and also to applications in nanoscale electronics, because Joule heating of interconnecting wires is a major problem in nanoscale devices. It has been shown that ultrathin layers of metal can display superconductivity, but any limits on the size of superconducting systems remain a mystery. (BETS)<sub>2</sub>GaCl<sub>4</sub>, where BETS is bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene, is an organic superconductor, and in bulk it has a superconducting transition temperature T<sub>c</sub> of &#8764;8 K (ref.) and a two-dimensional layered structure that is reminiscent of the high-T<sub>c</sub> cuprate superconductors. Here, we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to show that a single layer of (BETS)<sub>2</sub>GaCl<sub>4</sub> molecules on an Ag(111) surface displays a superconducting gap that increases exponentially with the length of the molecular chain. Moreover, we show that a superconducting gap can still be detected for just four pairs of (BETS)<sub>2</sub>GaCl<sub>4</sub> molecules.

letter,Proposal for an all-spin logic device with built-in memory,"<p>The possible use of spin rather than charge as a state variable in devices for processing and storing information has been widely discussed, because it could allow low-power operation and might also have applications in quantum computing. However, spin-based experiments and proposals for logic applications typically use spin only as an internal variable, the terminal quantities for each individual logic gate still being charge-based. This requires repeated spin-to-charge conversion, using extra hardware that offsets any possible advantage. Here we propose a spintronic device that uses spin at every stage of its operation. Input and output information are represented by the magnetization of nanomagnets that communicate through spin-coherent channels. Based on simulations with an experimentally benchmarked model, we argue that the device is both feasible and shows the five essential characteristics for logic applications: concatenability, nonlinearity, feedback elimination, gain and a complete set of Boolean operations.</p>",[],False,"[""Behtash Behin-Aein"", ""Deepanjan Datta"", ""Sayeef Salahuddin"", ""Supriyo Datta""]","Behin-Aein, B., Datta, D., Salahuddin, S. et al.

Here we show a theoretical comparison of how the size of titanium dioxide nanoparticles and their concentration in sunscreens can affect efficacy, aesthetics and potential toxicity from free radical production. The simulation results reveal that, unless very small nanoparticles can be shown to be safe, there is no combination of particle size and concentration that will deliver optimal performance in terms of sun protection and aesthetics.

letter,Lipid multilayer gratings,"<p>The interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter can be controlled by structuring the matter on the scale of the wavelength of light, and various photonic components have been made by structuring materials using top-down or bottom-up approaches. Dip-pen nanolithography is a scanning-probe-based fabrication technique that can be used to deposit materials on surfaces with high resolution and, when carried out in parallel, with high throughput. Here, we show that lyotropic optical diffraction gratings&#8212;composed of biofunctional lipid multilayers with controllable heights between &#8764;5 and 100 nm&#8212;can be fabricated by lipid dip-pen nanolithography. Multiple materials can be simultaneously written into arbitrary patterns on pre-structured surfaces to generate complex structures and devices, allowing nanostructures to be interfaced by combinations of top-down and bottom-up fabrication methods. We also show that fluid and biocompatible lipid multilayer gratings allow label-free and specific detection of lipid&#8211;protein interactions in solution.

The ability to image whole, living cells with nanometre resolution on a timescale that is relevant to dynamic cellular processes has so far been elusive. Here, we investigate the kinetics of individual bacterial cell death using a novel high-speed atomic force microscope optimized for imaging live cells in real time. The increased time resolution (13&#160;s per image) allows the characterization of the initial stages of the action of the antimicrobial peptide CM15 on individual Escherichia coli cells with nanometre resolution.

letter,Three-dimensional tissue culture based on magnetic cell levitation,"<p>Cell culture is an essential tool in drug discovery, tissue engineering and stem cell research. Conventional tissue culture produces two-dimensional cell growth with gene expression, signalling and morphology that can be different from those found in vivo, and this compromises its clinical relevance. Here, we report a three-dimensional tissue culture based on magnetic levitation of cells in the presence of a hydrogel consisting of gold, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and filamentous bacteriophage. By spatially controlling the magnetic field, the geometry of the cell mass can be manipulated, and multicellular clustering of different cell types in co-culture can be achieved. Magnetically levitated human glioblastoma cells showed similar protein expression profiles to those observed in human tumour xenografts. Taken together, these results indicate that levitated three-dimensional culture with magnetized phage-based hydrogels more closely recapitulates in vivo protein expression and may be more feasible for long-term multicellular studies.</p>",[],False,"[""Glauco R.

article,Direct seawater desalination by ion concentration polarization,"<p>A shortage of fresh water is one of the acute challenges facing the world today. An energy-efficient approach to converting sea water into fresh water could be of substantial benefit, but current desalination methods require high power consumption and operating costs or large-scale infrastructures, which make them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings or in disaster scenarios. Here, we report a process for converting sea water (salinity &#8764;500 mM or &#8764;30,000 mg l<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) to fresh water (salinity &lt;10&#160;mM or &lt;600&#160;mg&#160;l<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) in which a continuous stream of sea water is divided into desalted and concentrated streams by ion concentration polarization, a phenomenon that occurs when an ion current is passed through ion-selective membranes. During operation, both salts and larger particles (cells, viruses and microorganisms) are pushed away from the membrane (a nanochannel or nanoporous membrane), which significantly reduces the possibility of membrane fouling and salt accumulation, thus avoiding two problems that plague other membrane filtration methods. To implement this approach, a simple microfluidic device was fabricated and shown to be capable of continuous desalination of sea water (&#8764;99% salt rejection at 50% recovery rate) at a power consumption of less than 3.5 Wh l<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is comparable to current state-of-the-art systems.

article,Detection of single-molecule H2O2 signalling from epidermal growth factor receptor using fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>An emerging concept in cell signalling is the natural role of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) as beneficial messengers in redox signalling pathways. The nature of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signalling is confounded, however, by difficulties in tracking it in living systems, both spatially and temporally, at low concentrations. Here, we develop an array of fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes that can selectively record, in real time, the discrete, stochastic quenching events that occur as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecules are emitted from individual human epidermal carcinoma cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor. We show mathematically that such arrays can distinguish between molecules originating locally on the cell membrane from other contributions. We find that epidermal growth factor induces 2&#160;nmol H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> locally over a period of 50&#160;min.
