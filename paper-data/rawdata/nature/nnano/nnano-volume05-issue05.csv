letter,Facile synthesis of high-quality graphene nanoribbons,"<p>Graphene nanoribbons have attracted attention because of their novel electronic and spin transport properties, and also because nanoribbons less than 10&#160;nm wide have a bandgap that can be used to make field-effect transistors. However, producing nanoribbons of very high quality, or in high volumes, remains a challenge. Here, we show that pristine few-layer nanoribbons can be produced by unzipping mildly gas-phase oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes using mechanical sonication in an organic solvent. The nanoribbons are of very high quality, with smooth edges (as seen by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy), low ratios of disorder to graphitic Raman bands, and the highest electrical conductance and mobility reported so far (up to 5e<sup>2</sup>/h and 1,500&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for ribbons 10&#8211;20 nm in width). Furthermore, at low temperatures, the nanoribbons show phase-coherent transport and Fabry&#8211;Perot interference, suggesting minimal defects and edge roughness. The yield of nanoribbons is &#8764;2% of the starting raw nanotube soot material, significantly higher than previous methods capable of producing high-quality narrow nanoribbons. The relatively high-yield synthesis of pristine graphene nanoribbons will make these materials easily accessible for a wide range of fundamental and practical applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Liying Jiao"", ""Xinran Wang"", ""Georgi Diankov"", ""Hailiang Wang"", ""Hongjie Dai""]","Jiao, L., Wang, X., Diankov, G. et al.

letter,An extended defect in graphene as a metallic wire,"<p>Many proposed applications of graphene require the ability to tune its electronic structure at the nanoscale. Although charge transfer and field-effect doping can be applied to manipulate charge carrier concentrations, using them to achieve nanoscale control remains a challenge. An alternative approach is &#8216;self-doping&#8217;, in which extended defects are introduced into the graphene lattice. The controlled engineering of these defects represents a viable approach to creation and nanoscale control of one-dimensional charge distributions with widths of several atoms. However, the only experimentally realized extended defects so far have been the edges of graphene nanoribbons, which show dangling bonds that make them chemically unstable. Here, we report the realization of a one-dimensional topological defect in graphene, containing octagonal and pentagonal sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon rings embedded in a perfect graphene sheet. By doping the surrounding graphene lattice, the defect acts as a quasi-one-dimensional metallic wire. Such wires may form building blocks for atomic-scale, all-carbon electronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Jayeeta Lahiri"", ""You Lin"", ""Pinar Bozkurt"", ""Ivan I.

letter,Optical heating and rapid transformation of functionalized fullerenes,"<p>Irradiating single-walled carbon nanotubes can lead to heat generation or ignition. These processes could be used in medical and industrial applications, but the poor solvent compatibility and high aspect ratios of nanotubes have led to concerns about safety. Here, we show that certain functionalized fullerenes, including polyhydroxy fullerenes (which are known to be environmentally safe and to have therapeutic properties) are heated or ignited by exposure to low-intensity (&lt;10<sup>2</sup>&#160;W&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) continuous-wave laser irradiation. We also show that polyhydroxy fullerenes and other functionalized fullerenes can be transformed into single-walled nanotubes, multiwalled nanotubes and carbon onions without the presence of a catalyst by exposure to low-intensity laser irradiation in an oxygen-free environment. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of these processes in applications, we disrupted animal cells dosed with polyhydroxy fullerenes by exposing them to a near-infrared laser for a few seconds, and also ignited an explosive charge in contact with a particle of carboxy fullerenes.</p>",[],False,"[""Vijay Krishna"", ""Nathanael Stevens"", ""Ben Koopman"", ""Brij Moudgil""]","Krishna, V., Stevens, N., Koopman, B. et al.

letter,Penetration of thin C60 films by metal nanoparticles,"<p>Metal nanoparticles supported by thin films are important in the fields of molecular electronics, biotechnology and catalysis, among others. Penetration of these nanoparticles through their supporting films can be undesirable in some circumstances but desirable in others, and is often considered to be a diffusive process. Here, we demonstrate a mechanism for the penetration of thin films and other nanoscopic barriers that is different from simple diffusion. Silver clusters that are soft-landed onto a monolayer of C<sub>60</sub> supported by gold sink through the monolayer in a matter of hours. However, the clusters are stable when landed onto two monolayers of C<sub>60</sub> supported on gold, or on one monolayer of C<sub>60</sub> supported on graphite.

letter,Biologically templated photocatalytic nanostructures for sustained light-driven water oxidation,"<p>Over several billion years, cyanobacteria and plants have evolved highly organized photosynthetic systems to shuttle both electronic and chemical species for the efficient oxidation of water. In a similar manner to reaction centres in natural photosystems, molecular and metal oxide catalysts have been used to photochemically oxidize water. However, the various approaches involving the molecular design of ligands, surface modification and immobilization still have limitations in terms of catalytic efficiency and sustainability. Here, we demonstrate a biologically templated nanostructure for visible light-driven water oxidation that uses a genetically engineered M13 virus scaffold to mediate the co-assembly of zinc porphyrins (photosensitizer) and iridium oxide hydrosol clusters (catalyst). Porous polymer microgels are used as an immobilization matrix to improve the structural durability of the assembled nanostructures and to allow the materials to be recycled.

letter,Observation and control of blinking nitrogen-vacancy centres in discrete nanodiamonds,"<p>Nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond can undergo strong, spin-sensitive optical transitions under ambient conditions, which makes them attractive for applications in quantum optics, nanoscale magnetometry and biolabelling. Although nitrogen-vacancy centres have been observed in aggregated detonation nanodiamonds and milled nanodiamonds, they have not been observed in very small isolated nanodiamonds. Here, we report the first direct observation of nitrogen-vacancy centres in discrete 5-nm nanodiamonds at room temperature, including evidence for intermittency in the luminescence (blinking) from the nanodiamonds.

letter,Imaging and manipulating the spin direction of individual atoms,"<p>Single magnetic atoms on surfaces are the smallest conceivable units for two-dimensional magnetic data storage. Previous experiments on such systems have investigated magnetization curves, the many-body Kondo effect and magnetic excitations in quantum spin systems, but a stable magnetization has not yet been detected for an atom on a non-magnetic surface in the absence of a magnetic field. The spin direction of a single magnetic atom can be fixed by coupling it to an underlying magnetic substrate via the exchange interaction, but it is then difficult to differentiate between the magnetism of the atom and the surface. Here, we take advantage of the orbital symmetry of the spin-polarized density of states of single cobalt atoms to unambiguously determine their spin direction in real space using a combination of spin-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments and ab initio calculations. By laterally moving atoms on our non-collinear magnetic template, the spin direction can also be controlled while maintaining magnetic sensitivity, thereby providing an approach for constructing and characterizing artificial atomic-scale magnetic structures.</p>",[],False,"[""David Serrate"", ""Paolo Ferriani"", ""Yasuo Yoshida"", ""Saw-Wai Hla"", ""Matthias Menzel"", ""Kirsten von Bergmann"", ""Stefan Heinze"", ""Andre Kubetzka"", ""Roland Wiesendanger""]","Serrate, D., Ferriani, P., Yoshida, Y. et al.

letter,Carbon nanotubes degraded by neutrophil myeloperoxidase induce less pulmonary inflammation,"<p>We have shown previously that single-walled carbon nanotubes can be catalytically biodegraded over several weeks by the plant-derived enzyme, horseradish peroxidase. However, whether peroxidase intermediates generated inside human cells or biofluids are involved in the biodegradation of carbon nanotubes has not been explored. Here, we show that hypochlorite and reactive radical intermediates of the human neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase catalyse the biodegradation of single-walled carbon nanotubes in vitro, in neutrophils and to a lesser degree in macrophages. Molecular modelling suggests that interactions of basic amino acids of the enzyme with the carboxyls on the carbon nanotubes position the nanotubes near the catalytic site. Importantly, the biodegraded nanotubes do not generate an inflammatory response when aspirated into the lungs of mice. Our findings suggest that the extent to which carbon nanotubes are biodegraded may be a major determinant of the scale and severity of the associated inflammatory responses in exposed individuals.</p>",[],False,"[""Valerian E.

article,Electron diffractive imaging of oxygen atoms in nanocrystals at sub-ångström resolution,"<p>High-resolution imaging of low-atomic-number chemical elements using electron microscopy is challenging and may require the use of high doses of electrons. Electron diffractive imaging, which creates real-space images using diffraction intensities and phase retrieval methods, could overcome such issues, although it is also subject to limitations. Here, we show that a combination of electron diffractive imaging and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy can image individual TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals with a resolution of 70&#160;pm while exposing the specimen to a low dose of electrons.

article,Self-powered nanowire devices,"<p>The harvesting of mechanical energy from ambient sources could power electrical devices without the need for batteries. However, although the efficiency and durability of harvesting materials such as piezoelectric nanowires have steadily improved, the voltage and power produced by a single nanowire are insufficient for real devices. The integration of large numbers of nanowire energy harvesters into a single power source is therefore necessary, requiring alignment of the nanowires as well as synchronization of their charging and discharging processes. Here, we demonstrate the vertical and lateral integration of ZnO nanowires into arrays that are capable of producing sufficient power to operate real devices. A lateral integration of 700 rows of ZnO nanowires produces a peak voltage of 1.26&#160;V at a low strain of 0.19%, which is potentially sufficient to recharge an AA battery.
