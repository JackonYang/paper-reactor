review article,Nanostructured materials for photon detection,"<p>The detection of photons underpins imaging, spectroscopy, fibre-optic communications and time-gated distance measurements. Nanostructured materials are attractive for detection applications because they can be integrated with conventional silicon electronics and flexible, large-area substrates, and can be processed from the solution phase using established techniques such as spin casting, spray coating and layer-by-layer deposition. In addition, their performance has improved rapidly in recent years. Here we review progress in light sensing using nanostructured materials, focusing on solution-processed materials such as colloidal quantum dots and metal nanoparticles. These devices exhibit phenomena such as absorption of ultraviolet light, plasmonic enhancement of absorption, size-based spectral tuning, multiexciton generation, and charge carrier storage in surface and interface traps.</p>",,"[{'address': ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 10 King's College Road, Toronto, M5S 3G4, Ontario, Canada"", 'authors': ['Gerasimos Konstantatos', '\xa0&\xa0Edward H.

letter,Direct mapping of the solid–liquid adhesion energy with subnanometre resolution,"<p>Solid&#8211;liquid interfaces play a fundamental role in surface electrochemistry, catalysis, wetting, self-assembly and biomolecular functions. The interfacial energy determines many of the properties of such interfaces, including the arrangement of the liquid molecules at the surface of the solid. Diffraction techniques are often used to investigate the structure of solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, but measurements of irregular or inhomogeneous interfaces remain challenging. Here, we report atomic- and molecular-resolution images of various organic and inorganic samples in liquids, obtained with a commercial atomic force microscope operated dynamically with small-amplitude modulation. This approach uses the structured liquid layers close to the solid to enhance lateral resolution. We propose a model to explain the mechanism dominating the image formation, and show that the energy dissipated during this process is related to the interfacial energy through a readily achievable calibration curve. Our topographic images and interfacial energy maps could provide insights into important interfaces.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Kislon Voïtchovsky', ',\xa0Jeffrey J.

letter,Spontaneous high-concentration dispersions and liquid crystals of graphene,"<p>Graphene combines unique electronic properties and surprising quantum effects with outstanding thermal and mechanical properties. Many potential applications, including electronics and nanocomposites, require that graphene be dispersed and processed in a fluid phase. Here, we show that graphite spontaneously exfoliates into single-layer graphene in chlorosulphonic acid, and dissolves at isotropic concentrations as high as &#8764;2 mg ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is an order of magnitude higher than previously reported values. This occurs without the need for covalent functionalization, surfactant stabilization, or sonication, which can compromise the properties of graphene or reduce flake size. We also report spontaneous formation of liquid-crystalline phases at high concentrations (&#8764;20&#8211;30 mg ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Transparent, conducting films are produced from these dispersions at 1,000&#937;&#160;&#9633;<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and &#8764;80% transparency.

letter,Liquid glass electrodes for nanofluidics,"<p>Nanofluidic devices make use of molecular-level forces and phenomena to increase their density, speed and accuracy. However, fabrication is challenging, because dissimilar materials need to be integrated in three dimensions with nanoscale precision. Here, we report a three-dimensional nanoscale liquid glass electrode made from monolithic substrates without conductive materials by femtosecond-laser nanomachining. The electrode consists of a nanochannel terminating at a nanoscale glass tip that becomes a conductor in the presence of high electric fields through dielectric breakdown, and returns to being an insulator when this field is removed. This reversibility relies on control of nanoampere breakdown currents and extremely fast heat dissipation at nanoscale volumes. We use the nanoscale liquid glass electrode to fabricate a nano-injector that includes an electrokinetic pump, 4&#160;&#181;m across with 0.6&#160;&#181;m channels, which is capable of producing well-controlled flow rates below 1&#160;fl&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

letter,DNA computing circuits using libraries of DNAzyme subunits,"<p>Biological systems that are capable of performing computational operations could be of use in bioengineering and nanomedicine, and DNA and other biomolecules have already been used as active components in biocomputational circuits. There have also been demonstrations of DNA/RNA-enzyme-based automatons, logic control of gene expression, and RNA systems for processing of intracellular information. However, for biocomputational circuits to be useful for applications it will be necessary to develop a library of computing elements, to demonstrate the modular coupling of these elements, and to demonstrate that this approach is scalable. Here, we report the construction of a DNA-based computational platform that uses a library of catalytic nucleic acids (DNAzymes), and their substrates, for the input-guided dynamic assembly of a universal set of logic gates and a half-adder/half-subtractor system. We demonstrate multilayered gate cascades, fan-out gates and parallel logic gate operations.

letter,Understanding amyloid aggregation by statistical analysis of atomic force microscopy images,"<p>The aggregation of proteins is central to many aspects of daily life, including food processing, blood coagulation, eye cataract formation disease and prion-related neurodegenerative infections. However, the physical mechanisms responsible for amyloidosis&#8212;the irreversible fibril formation of various proteins that is linked to disorders such as Alzheimer's, Creutzfeldt&#8211;Jakob and Huntington's diseases&#8212;have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we show that different stages of amyloid aggregation can be examined by performing a statistical polymer physics analysis of single-molecule atomic force microscopy images of heat-denatured &#946;-lactoglobulin fibrils. The atomic force microscopy analysis, supported by theoretical arguments, reveals that the fibrils have a multistranded helical shape with twisted ribbon-like structures.

article,Dispensing nano–pico droplets and liquid patterning by pyroelectrodynamic shooting,"<p>Manipulating and dispensing liquids on the micrometre- and nanoscale is important in biotechnology and combinatorial chemistry, and also for patterning inorganic, organic and biological inks. Several methods for dispensing liquids exist, but many require complicated electrodes and high-voltage circuits. Here, we show a simple way to draw attolitre liquid droplets from one or multiple sessile drops or liquid film reservoirs using a pyroelectrohydrodynamic dispenser. Local pyroelectric forces, which are activated by scanning a hot tip or an infrared laser beam over a lithium niobate substrate, draw liquid droplets from the reservoir below the substrate, and deposit them on the underside of the lithium niobate substrate. The shooting direction is altered by moving the hot tip or laser to form various patterns at different angles and locations. Our system does not require electrodes, nozzles or circuits, and is expected to have many applications in biochemical assays and various transport and mixing processes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'CNR Istituto Nazionale di Ottica–Sezione di Napoli Via Campi Flegrei, 34–80078 Pozzuoli (Napoli), Italy', 'authors': ['P.

article,A double-stranded DNA rotaxane,"<p>Mechanically interlocked molecules such as rotaxanes and catenanes have potential as components of molecular machinery. Rotaxanes consist of a dumb-bell-shaped molecule encircled by a macrocycle that can move unhindered along the axle, trapped by bulky stoppers. Previously, rotaxanes have been made from a variety of molecules, but not from DNA. Here, we report the design, assembly and characterization of rotaxanes in which both the dumb-bell-shaped molecule and the macrocycle are made of double-stranded DNA, and in which the axle of the dumb-bell is threaded through the macrocycle by base pairing. The assembly involves the formation of pseudorotaxanes, in which the macrocycle and the axle are locked together by hybridization. Ligation of stopper modules to the axle leads to the characteristic dumb-bell topology. When an oligonucleotide is added to release the macrocycle from the axle, the pseudorotaxanes are either converted to mechanically stable rotaxanes, or they disassemble by means of a slippage mechanism to yield a dumb-bell and a free macrocycle. Our DNA rotaxanes allow the fields of mechanically interlocked molecules and DNA nanotechnology to be combined, thus opening new possibilities for research into molecular machines and synthetic biology.</p>",,"[{'address': 'LIMES Institute, Program Unit Chemical Biology & Medicinal Chemistry, c/o Kekulé Institut für Organische Chemie und Biochemie, University of Bonn, Gerhard-Domagk-Straße 1, Bonn, 53121, Germany', 'authors': ['Damian Ackermann', ',\xa0Jeffrey S.

article,Advanced sorting of single-walled carbon nanotubes by nonlinear density-gradient ultracentrifugation,"<p>Existing methods for growing single-walled carbon nanotubes produce samples with a range of structures and electronic properties, but many potential applications require pure nanotube samples. Density-gradient ultracentrifugation has recently emerged as a technique for sorting as-grown mixtures of single-walled nanotubes into their distinct (n,m) structural forms, but to date this approach has been limited to samples containing only a small number of nanotube structures, and has often required repeated density-gradient ultracentrifugation processing. Here, we report that the use of tailored nonlinear density gradients can significantly improve density-gradient ultracentrifugation separations. We show that highly polydisperse samples of single-walled nanotubes grown by the HiPco method are readily sorted in a single step to give fractions enriched in any of ten different (n,m) species. Furthermore, minor variants of the method allow separation of the mirror-image isomers (enantiomers) of seven (n,m) species. Optimization of this approach was aided by the development of instrumentation that spectroscopically maps nanotube contents inside undisturbed centrifuge tubes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and R.E.

Here, we report a nanoscale Set&#8211;Reset machine operating at room temperature that is based on a 5-nm silicon nanoparticle attached to the inner pore of a stable circular protein. The nanoparticle&#8211;protein hybrid can also function as a balanced ternary multiplier. Conductive atomic force microscopy is used to implement the logic input and output operations, and the processing of the logic Set and Reset operations relies on the finite capacitance of the nanoparticle provided by the good electrical isolation given by the protein, thus enabling stability of the logic device states. We show that the machine can be cycled, such that in every successive cycle, the previous state in the memory is retained as the present state. The energy cost of one cycle of computation is minimized to the cost of charging this state.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physical Chemistry and Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, 91904, Israel', 'authors': ['Izhar Medalsy', '\xa0&\xa0Danny Porath']}, {'address': 'The Fritz Haber Research Center for Molecular Dynamics, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, 91904, Israel', 'authors': ['Michael Klein', '\xa0&\xa0R.

article,Hybrid superconductor–semiconductor devices made from self-assembled SiGe nanocrystals on silicon,"<p>The epitaxial growth of germanium on silicon leads to the self-assembly of SiGe nanocrystals by a process that allows the size, composition and position of the nanocrystals to be controlled. This level of control, combined with an inherent compatibility with silicon technology, could prove useful in nanoelectronic applications. Here, we report the confinement of holes in quantum-dot devices made by directly contacting individual SiGe nanocrystals with aluminium electrodes, and the production of hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor devices, such as resonant supercurrent transistors, when the quantum dot is strongly coupled to the electrodes. Charge transport measurements on weakly coupled quantum dots reveal discrete energy spectra, with the confined hole states displaying anisotropic gyromagnetic factors and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling with pronounced dependences on gate voltage and magnetic field.</p>",,"[{'address': 'CEA, INAC/SPSMS/LaTEQS, 17 Rue des Martyrs, Grenoble, 38054, France', 'authors': ['G.

article,Tuning payload delivery in tumour cylindroids using gold nanoparticles,"<p>Nanoparticles have great potential as controllable drug delivery vehicles because of their size and modular functionality. Timing and location are important parameters when optimizing nanoparticles for delivery of chemotherapeutics. Here, we show that gold nanoparticles carrying either fluorescein or doxorubicin molecules move and localize differently in an in vitro three-dimensional model of tumour tissue, depending on whether the nanoparticles are positively or negatively charged. Fluorescence microscopy and mathematical modelling show that uptake, not diffusion, is the dominant mechanism in particle delivery. Our results indicate that positive particles may be more effective for drug delivery because they are taken up to a greater extent by proliferating cells. Negative particles, which diffuse more quickly, may perform better when delivering drugs deep into tissues. An understanding of how surface charge can control tissue penetration and drug release may overcome some of the current limitations in drug delivery.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 01003-9303, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Byoungjin Kim', ',\xa0Bhushan J.
