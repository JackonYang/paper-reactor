review article,Graphene transistors,"<p>Graphene has changed from being the exclusive domain of condensed-matter physicists to being explored by those in the electron-device community. In particular, graphene-based transistors have developed rapidly and are now considered an option for post-silicon electronics. However, many details about the potential performance of graphene transistors in real applications remain unclear. Here I review the properties of graphene that are relevant to electron devices, discuss the trade-offs among these properties and examine their effects on the performance of graphene transistors in both logic and radiofrequency applications. I conclude that the excellent mobility of graphene may not, as is often assumed, be its most compelling feature from a device perspective. Rather, it may be the possibility of making devices with channels that are extremely thin that will allow graphene field-effect transistors to be scaled to shorter channel lengths and higher speeds without encountering the adverse short-channel effects that restrict the performance of existing devices. Outstanding challenges for graphene transistors include opening a sizeable and well-defined bandgap in graphene, making large-area graphene transistors that operate in the current-saturation regime and fabricating graphene nanoribbons with well-defined widths and clean edges.</p>",[],False,"[""Frank Schwierz""]","Schwierz, F.

letter,Thermal infrared emission from biased graphene,"<p>The high carrier mobility and thermal conductivity of graphene make it a candidate material for future high-speed electronic devices. Although the thermal behaviour of high-speed devices can limit their performance, the thermal properties of graphene devices remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that spatially resolved thermal radiation from biased graphene transistors can be used to extract the temperature distribution, carrier densities and spatial location of the Dirac point in the graphene channel. The graphene exhibits a temperature maximum with a location that can be controlled by the gate voltage. Stationary hot spots are also observed.

letter,Spectroscopy of few-electron single-crystal silicon quantum dots,"<p>A defining feature of modern CMOS devices and almost all quantum semiconductor devices is the use of many different materials. For example, although electrical conduction often occurs in single-crystal semiconductors, gates are frequently made of metals and dielectrics are commonly amorphous. Such devices have demonstrated remarkable improvements in performance over recent decades, but the heterogeneous nature of these devices can lead to defects at the interfaces between the different materials, which is a disadvantage for applications in spintronics and quantum information processing. Here we report the fabrication of a few-electron quantum dot in single-crystal silicon that does not contain any heterogeneous interfaces. The quantum dot is defined by atomically abrupt changes in the density of phosphorus dopant atoms, and the resulting confinement produces novel effects associated with energy splitting between the conduction band valleys. These single-crystal devices offer the opportunity to study how very sharp, atomic-scale confinement&#8212;which will become increasingly important for both classical and quantum devices&#8212;influences the operation and performance of devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Martin Fuechsle"", ""S.

letter,Direct imaging of single metal atoms and clusters in the pores of dealuminated HY zeolite,"<p>Zeolites are aluminosilicate materials that contain regular three-dimensional arrays of molecular-scale pores, and they can act as hosts for catalytically active metal clusters. The catalytic properties of such zeolites depend on the sizes and shapes of the clusters, and also on the location of the clusters within the pores. Transmission electron microscopy has been used to image single atoms and nanoclusters on surfaces, but the damage caused by the electron beam has made it difficult to image zeolites. Here, we show that aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy can be used to determine the locations of individual metal atoms and nanoclusters within the pores of a zeolite. We imaged the active sites of iridium catalysts anchored in dealuminated HY zeolite crystals, determined their locations and approximate distance from the crystal surface, and deduced a possible cluster formation mechanism.</p>",[],False,"[""Volkan Ortalan"", ""Alper Uzun"", ""Bruce C.

letter,Mimicking the colourful wing scale structure of the Papilio blumei butterfly,"<p>The brightest and most vivid colours in nature arise from the interaction of light with surfaces that exhibit periodic structure on the micro- and nanoscale. In the wings of butterflies, for example, a combination of multilayer interference, optical gratings, photonic crystals and other optical structures gives rise to complex colour mixing. Although the physics of structural colours is well understood, it remains a challenge to create artificial replicas of natural photonic structures. Here we use a combination of layer deposition techniques, including colloidal self-assembly, sputtering and atomic layer deposition, to fabricate photonic structures that mimic the colour mixing effect found on the wings of the Indonesian butterfly Papilio blumei. We also show that a conceptual variation to the natural structure leads to enhanced optical properties.

letter,Large oscillations of the magnetoresistance in nanopatterned high-temperature superconducting films,"<p>Measurements on nanoscale structures constructed from high-temperature superconductors are expected to shed light on the origin of superconductivity in these materials. To date, loops made from these compounds have had sizes of the order of hundreds of nanometres<sup>8&#8211;11</sup>. Here, we report the results of measurements on loops of La<sub>1.84</sub>Sr<sub>0.16</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, a high-temperature superconductor that loses its resistance to electric currents when cooled below &#8764;38 K, with dimensions down to tens of nanometres. We observe oscillations in the resistance of the loops as a function of the magnetic flux through the loops. The oscillations have a period of h/2e, and their amplitude is much larger than the amplitude of the resistance oscillations expected from the Little&#8211;Parks effect. Moreover, unlike Little&#8211;Parks oscillations, which are caused by periodic changes in the superconducting transition temperature, the oscillations we observe are caused by periodic changes in the interaction between thermally excited moving vortices and the oscillating persistent current induced in the loops. However, despite the enhanced amplitude of these oscillations, we have not detected oscillations with a period of h/e, as recently predicted for nanoscale loops of superconductors with d-wave symmetry, or with a period of h/4e, as predicted for superconductors that exhibit stripes.</p>",[],False,"[""Ilya Sochnikov"", ""Avner Shaulov"", ""Yosef Yeshurun"", ""Gennady Logvenov"", ""Ivan Bo\u017eovi\u0107""]","Sochnikov, I., Shaulov, A., Yeshurun, Y. et al.

letter,Self-assembly of three-dimensional prestressed tensegrity structures from DNA,"<p>Tensegrity, or tensional integrity, is a property of a structure indicating a reliance on a balance between components that are either in pure compression or pure tension for stability. Tensegrity structures exhibit extremely high strength-to-weight ratios and great resilience, and are therefore widely used in engineering, robotics and architecture. Here, we report nanoscale, prestressed, three-dimensional tensegrity structures in which rigid bundles of DNA double helices resist compressive forces exerted by segments of single-stranded DNA that act as tension-bearing cables. Our DNA tensegrity structures can self-assemble against forces up to 14&#160;pN, which is twice the stall force of powerful molecular motors such as kinesin or myosin. The forces generated by this molecular prestressing mechanism can be used to bend the DNA bundles or to actuate the entire structure through enzymatic cleavage at specific sites. In addition to being building blocks for nanostructures, tensile structural elements made of single-stranded DNA could be used to study molecular forces, cellular mechanotransduction and other fundamental biological processes.</p>",[],False,"[""Tim Liedl"", ""Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6gberg"", ""Jessica Tytell"", ""Donald E.

Here, we extend dielectrophoretic nanowire assembly to achieve a 98.5% yield of single nanowires assembled over 16,000 patterned electrode sites with submicrometre alignment precision. The balancing of surface, hydrodynamic and dielectrophoretic forces makes the self-assembly process controllable, and a hydrodynamic force component makes it self-limiting.

Layer-by-layer techniques are used to assemble an electrode that consists of additive-free, densely packed and functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes.
