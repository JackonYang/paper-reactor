letter,Light-driven nanoscale plasmonic motors,"<p>When Sir William Crookes developed a four-vaned radiometer, also known as the light-mill, in 1873, it was believed that this device confirmed the existence of linear momentum carried by photons, as predicted by Maxwell's equations. Although Reynolds later proved that the torque on the radiometer was caused by thermal transpiration, researchers continued to search for ways to take advantage of the momentum of photons and to use it for generating rotational forces. The ability to provide rotational force at the nanoscale could open up a range of applications in physics, biology and chemistry, including DNA unfolding and sequencing and nanoelectromechanical systems. Here, we demonstrate a nanoscale plasmonic structure that can, when illuminated with linearly polarized light, generate a rotational force that is capable of rotating a silica microdisk that is 4,000 times larger in volume. Furthermore, we can control the rotation velocity and direction by varying the wavelength of the incident light to excite different plasmonic modes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'NSF Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC), 3112 Etcheverry Hall, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Ming Liu', ',\xa0Thomas Zentgraf', ',\xa0Yongmin Liu', ',\xa0Guy Bartal', '\xa0&\xa0Xiang Zhang']}, {'address': 'Material Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Xiang Zhang']}]",False,"['Ming Liu', 'Thomas Zentgraf', 'Yongmin Liu', 'Guy Bartal', 'Xiang Zhang']","Liu, M., Zentgraf, T., Liu, Y. et al.

letter,Roll-to-roll production of 30-inch graphene films for transparent electrodes,"<p>The outstanding electrical, mechanical and chemical properties of graphene make it attractive for applications in flexible electronics. However, efforts to make transparent conducting films from graphene have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for the synthesis, transfer and doping of graphene at the scale and quality required for applications. Here, we report the roll-to-roll production and wet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene films grown by chemical vapour deposition onto flexible copper substrates. The films have sheet resistances as low as &#8764;125 &#937; &#9633;<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with 97.4% optical transmittance, and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, indicating their high quality. We further use layer-by-layer stacking to fabricate a doped four-layer film and measure its sheet resistance at values as low as &#8764;30 &#937; &#9633;<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at &#8764;90% transparency, which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxides.

letter,Computer simulation of the translocation of nanoparticles with different shapes across a lipid bilayer,"<p>Understanding how nanoparticles with different shapes interact with cell membranes is important in drug and gene delivery, but this interaction remains poorly studied. Using computer simulations, we investigate the physical translocation processes of nanoparticles with different shapes (for example, spheres, ellipsoids, rods, discs and pushpin-like particles) and volumes across a lipid bilayer. We find that the shape anisotropy and initial orientation of the particle are crucial to the nature of the interaction between the particle and lipid bilayer. The penetrating capability of a nanoparticle across a lipid bilayer is determined by the contact area between the particle and lipid bilayer, and the local curvature of the particle at the contact point. Particle volume affects translocation indirectly, and particle rotation can complicate the penetration process.

letter,Making flexible magnetic aerogels and stiff magnetic nanopaper using cellulose nanofibrils as templates,"<p>Nanostructured biological materials inspire the creation of materials with tunable mechanical properties. Strong cellulose nanofibrils derived from bacteria or wood can form ductile or tough networks that are suitable as functional materials. Here, we show that freeze-dried bacterial cellulose nanofibril aerogels can be used as templates for making lightweight porous magnetic aerogels, which can be compacted into a stiff magnetic nanopaper. The 20&#8211;70-nm-thick cellulose nanofibrils act as templates for the non-agglomerated growth of ferromagnetic cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (diameter, 40&#8211;120&#160;nm). Unlike solvent-swollen gels and ferrogels, our magnetic aerogel is dry, lightweight, porous (98%), flexible, and can be actuated by a small household magnet. Moreover, it can absorb water and release it upon compression. Owing to their flexibility, high porosity and surface area, these aerogels are expected to be useful in microfluidics devices and as electronic actuators.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Fibre and Polymer Technology, Royal Institute of Technology, SE-100 44 Stockholm, Sweden', 'authors': ['R.

letter,Hysteresis-free operation of suspended carbon nanotube transistors,"<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes offer high sensitivity and very low power consumption when used as field-effect transistors in nanosensors. Suspending nanotubes between pairs of contacts, rather than attaching them to a surface, has many advantages in chemical, optical or displacement sensing applications, as well as for resonant electromechanical systems. Suspended nanotubes can be integrated into devices after nanotube growth, but contamination caused by the accompanying additional process steps can change device properties. Ultraclean suspended nanotubes can also be grown between existing device contacts, but high growth temperatures limit the choice of metals that can be used as contacts. Moreover, when operated in ambient conditions, devices fabricated by either the post- or pre-growth approach typically exhibit gate hysteresis, which makes device behaviour less reproducible. Here, we report the operation of nanotube transistors in a humid atmosphere without hysteresis. Suspended, individual and ultraclean nanotubes are grown directly between unmetallized device contacts, onto which palladium is then evaporated through self-aligned on-chip shadow masks. This yields pairs of needle-shaped source/drain contacts that have been theoretically shown to allow high nanotube&#8211;gate coupling and low gate voltages. This process paves the way for creating ultrasensitive nanosensors based on pristine suspended nanotubes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, Micro and Nanosystems, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['M.

letter,Long spin-relaxation time in a single metal nanoparticle,"<p>Spin-relaxation time is key to the performance of spin-based devices. Although the spin-relaxation times of semiconductor materials are typically &#8764;100 ns (ref.), they are on the order of picoseconds in bulk metals due to the high density of scattering centres. In metallic nanoparticles, the spin-relaxation times can be strongly enhanced due to the quantum size effect, reaching 150&#160;ns in cobalt nanoparticles. Here, we show that for extra electrons confined in a single ferromagnetic-metal MnAs nanoparticle embedded in a GaAs semiconductor matrix, the spin-relaxation time can reach 10&#160;&#181;s at 2&#160;K, which is seven orders of magnitude longer than those of conventional metallic thin film or bulk systems, and the longest value ever reported for metallic nanoparticles. This long relaxation time is made possible by using epitaxially grown single-crystal devices with abrupt interfaces, and by avoiding surface contamination of the MnAs nanoparticle. Such a long spin-relaxation time can be very useful in nanoscale spintronic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan', 'authors': ['Pham Nam Hai', ',\xa0Shinobu Ohya', '\xa0&\xa0Masaaki Tanaka']}]",False,"['Pham Nam Hai', 'Shinobu Ohya', 'Masaaki Tanaka']","Hai, P., Ohya, S. & Tanaka, M.

letter,Remote control of ion channels and neurons through magnetic-field heating of nanoparticles,"<p>Recently, optical stimulation has begun to unravel the neuronal processing that controls certain animal behaviours. However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Here, we show an approach based on radio-frequency magnetic-field heating of nanoparticles to remotely activate temperature-sensitive cation channels in cells. Superparamagnetic ferrite nanoparticles were targeted to specific proteins on the plasma membrane of cells expressing TRPV1, and heated by a radio-frequency magnetic field. Using fluorophores as molecular thermometers, we show that the induced temperature increase is highly localized. Thermal activation of the channels triggers action potentials in cultured neurons without observable toxic effects. This approach can be adapted to stimulate other cell types and, moreover, may be used to remotely manipulate other cellular machinery for novel therapeutics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University at Buffalo, the State University of New York, Buffalo, 14260, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Heng Huang', ',\xa0Savas Delikanli', ',\xa0Hao Zeng', '\xa0&\xa0Arnd Pralle']}, {'address': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University at Buffalo, the State University of New York, Buffalo, 14260, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Denise M.

article,"'Soft' Au, Pt and Cu contacts for molecular junctions through surface-diffusion-mediated deposition","<p>Virtually all types of molecular electronic devices depend on electronically addressing a molecule or molecular layer through the formation of a metallic contact. The introduction of molecular devices into integrated circuits will probably depend on the formation of contacts using a vapour deposition technique, but this approach frequently results in the metal atoms penetrating or damaging the molecular layer. Here, we report a method of forming &#8216;soft&#8217; metallic contacts on molecular layers through surface-diffusion-mediated deposition, in which the metal atoms are deposited remotely and then diffuse onto the molecular layer, thus eliminating the problems of penetration and damage. Molecular junctions fabricated by this method exhibit excellent yield (typically &gt;90%) and reproducibility, and allow examination of the effects of molecular-layer structure, thickness and contact work function.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials, Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University, 2041 College Road, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, USA', 'authors': ['Andrew P.

article,Efficient electronic coupling and improved stability with dithiocarbamate-based molecular junctions,"<p>Molecular electronic devices require stable and highly conductive contacts between the metal electrodes and molecules. Thiols and amines are widely used to attach molecules to metals, but they form poor electrical contacts and lack the robustness required for device applications. Here, we demonstrate that dithiocarbamates provide superior electrical contact and thermal stability when compared to thiols on metals. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory show the presence of electronic states at 0.6&#160;eV below the Fermi level of Au, which effectively reduce the charge injection barrier across the metal&#8722;molecule interface. Charge transport measurements across oligophenylene monolayers reveal that the conductance of terphenyl&#8211;dithiocarbamate junctions is two orders of magnitude higher than that of terphenyl&#8211;thiolate junctions. The stability and low contact resistance of dithiocarbamate-based molecular junctions represent a significant step towards the development of robust, organic-based electronic circuits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Sony Deutschland GmbH, Materials Science Laboratory, Hedelfinger Strasse 61, Stuttgart, 70327, Germany', 'authors': ['Florian von Wrochem', ',\xa0Deqing Gao', ',\xa0Frank Scholz', ',\xa0Heinz-Georg Nothofer', ',\xa0Gabriele Nelles', '\xa0&\xa0Jurina M.
