letter,Beam pen lithography,"<p>Lithography techniques are currently being developed to fabricate nanoscale components for integrated circuits, medical diagnostics and optoelectronics. In conventional far-field optical lithography, lateral feature resolution is diffraction-limited. Approaches that overcome the diffraction limit have been developed, but these are difficult to implement or they preclude arbitrary pattern formation. Techniques based on near-field scanning optical microscopy can overcome the diffraction limit, but they suffer from inherently low throughput and restricted scan areas. Highly parallel two-dimensional, silicon-based, near-field scanning optical microscopy aperture arrays have been fabricated, but aligning a non-deformable aperture array to a large-area substrate with near-field proximity remains challenging. However, recent advances in lithographies based on scanning probe microscopy have made use of transparent two-dimensional arrays of pyramid-shaped elastomeric tips (or &#8216;pens&#8217;) for large-area, high-throughput patterning of ink molecules. Here, we report a massively parallel scanning probe microscopy-based approach that can generate arbitrary patterns by passing 400-nm light through nanoscopic apertures at each tip in the array. The technique, termed beam pen lithography, can toggle between near- and far-field distances, allowing both sub-diffraction limit (100&#160;nm) and larger features to be generated.</p>",[],False,"[""Fengwei Huo"", ""Gengfeng Zheng"", ""Xing Liao"", ""Louise R.

letter,Nanomechanical mass sensing and stiffness spectrometry based on two-dimensional vibrations of resonant nanowires,"<p>One-dimensional nanomechanical resonators based on nanowires and nanotubes have emerged as promising candidates for mass sensors. When the resonator is clamped at one end and the atoms or molecules being measured land on the other end (which is free to vibrate), the resonance frequency of the device decreases by an amount that is proportional to the mass of the atoms or molecules. However, atoms and molecules can land at any position along the resonator, and many biomolecules have sizes that are comparable to the size of the resonator, so the relationship between the added mass and the frequency shift breaks down. Moreover, whereas resonators fabricated by top-down methods tend to vibrate in just one dimension because they are usually shaped like diving boards, perfectly axisymmetric one-dimensional nanoresonators can support flexural vibrations with the same amplitude and frequency in two dimensions. Here, we propose a new approach to mass sensing and stiffness spectroscopy based on the fact that the nanoresonator will enter a superposition state of two orthogonal vibrations with different frequencies when this symmetry is broken. Measuring these frequencies allows the mass, stiffness and azimuthal arrival direction of the adsorbate to be determined.</p>",[],False,"[""Eduardo Gil-Santos"", ""Daniel Ramos"", ""Javier Mart\u00ednez"", ""Marta Fern\u00e1ndez-Reg\u00falez"", ""Ricardo Garc\u00eda"", ""\u00c1lvaro San Paulo"", ""Montserrat Calleja"", ""Javier Tamayo""]","Gil-Santos, E., Ramos, D., Martínez, J. et al.

letter,Ultrasensitive detection of force and displacement using trapped ions,"<p>The ability to detect extremely small forces and nanoscale displacements is vital for disciplines such as precision spin-resonance imaging, microscopy, and tests of fundamental physical phenomena. Current force-detection sensitivity limits have surpassed 1&#160;aN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> (refs&#160;) through coupling of nanomechanical resonators to a variety of physical readout systems. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of trapped atomic ions behave as nanoscale mechanical oscillators and may form the core of exquisitely sensitive force and displacement detectors. We report the detection of forces with a sensitivity of 390&#160;&#177;&#160;150&#160;yN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>, which is more than three orders of magnitude better than existing reports using nanofabricated devices<sup>7</sup>, and discriminate ion displacements of &#8764;18 nm. Our technique is based on the excitation of tunable normal motional modes in an ion trap and detection through phase-coherent Doppler velocimetry, and should ultimately allow force detection with a sensitivity better than 1&#160;yN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> (ref.&#160;).

letter,Ultrahigh-power micrometre-sized supercapacitors based on onion-like carbon,"<p>Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors, store energy in two closely spaced layers with opposing charges, and are used to power hybrid electric vehicles, portable electronic equipment and other devices. By offering fast charging and discharging rates, and the ability to sustain millions of cycles, electrochemical capacitors bridge the gap between batteries, which offer high energy densities but are slow, and conventional electrolytic capacitors, which are fast but have low energy densities. Here, we demonstrate microsupercapacitors with powers per volume that are comparable to electrolytic capacitors, capacitances that are four orders of magnitude higher, and energies per volume that are an order of magnitude higher. We also measured discharge rates of up to 200&#160;V&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is three orders of magnitude higher than conventional supercapacitors. The microsupercapacitors are produced by the electrophoretic deposition of a several-micrometre-thick layer of nanostructured carbon onions with diameters of 6&#8211;7&#160;nm. Integration of these nanoparticles in a microdevice with a high surface-to-volume ratio, without the use of organic binders and polymer separators, improves performance because of the ease with which ions can access the active material. Increasing the energy density and discharge rates of supercapacitors will enable them to compete with batteries and conventional electrolytic capacitors in a number of applications.</p>",[],False,"[""David Pech"", ""Magali Brunet"", ""Hugo Durou"", ""Peihua Huang"", ""Vadym Mochalin"", ""Yury Gogotsi"", ""Pierre-Louis Taberna"", ""Patrice Simon""]","Pech, D., Brunet, M., Durou, H. et al.

letter,Very large magnetoresistance in graphene nanoribbons,"<p>Graphene has unique electronic properties, and graphene nanoribbons are of particular interest because they exhibit a conduction bandgap that arises due to size confinement and edge effects. Theoretical studies have suggested that graphene nanoribbons could have interesting magneto-electronic properties, with a very large predicted magnetoresistance. Here, we report the experimental observation of a significant enhancement in the conductance of a graphene nanoribbon field-effect transistor by a perpendicular magnetic field. A negative magnetoresistance of nearly 100% was observed at low temperatures, with over 50% magnetoresistance remaining at room temperature. This magnetoresistance can be tuned by varying the gate or source&#8211;drain bias. We also find that the charge transport in the nanoribbons is not significantly modified by an in-plane magnetic field. The large observed values of magnetoresistance may be attributed to the reduction of quantum confinement through the formation of cyclotron orbits and the delocalization effect under the perpendicular magnetic field.</p>",[],False,"[""Jingwei Bai"", ""Rui Cheng"", ""Faxian Xiu"", ""Lei Liao"", ""Minsheng Wang"", ""Alexandros Shailos"", ""Kang L.

letter,Bioorthogonal chemistry amplifies nanoparticle binding and enhances the sensitivity of cell detection,"<p>Nanoparticles have emerged as key materials for biomedical applications because of their unique and tunable physical properties, multivalent targeting capability, and high cargo capacity. Motivated by these properties and by current clinical needs, numerous diagnostic and therapeutic nanomaterials have recently emerged. Here we describe a novel nanoparticle targeting platform that uses a rapid, catalyst-free cycloaddition as the coupling mechanism. Antibodies against biomarkers of interest were modified with trans-cyclooctene and used as scaffolds to couple tetrazine-modified nanoparticles onto live cells. We show that the technique is fast, chemoselective, adaptable to metal nanomaterials, and scalable for biomedical use. This method also supports amplification of biomarker signals, making it superior to alternative targeting techniques including avidin/biotin.</p>",[],False,"[""Jered B. Haun"", ""Neal K.

letter,Rationally designed logic integration of regulatory signals in mammalian cells,"<p>Molecular-level information processing is essential for &#8216;smart&#8217; in vivo nanosystems. Natural molecular computing, such as the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis by special proteins called transcription factors, has inspired engineered systems that can control the levels of mRNA with certain combinations of transcription factors. Here, we show an alternative approach to achieving general-purpose control of mRNA and protein levels by logic integration of transcription factor input signals in mammalian cells. The transcription factors regulate synthetic genes coding for small regulatory RNAs (called microRNAs), which, in turn, control the mRNA of interest (the output) via an RNA interference pathway. The simplicity of these modular interactions makes it possible, in theory, to implement any arbitrary logic relation between the transcription factors and the output. We construct, test and optimize increasingly complex circuits with up to three transcription factor inputs, establishing a platform for in vivo molecular computing.</p>",[],False,"[""Madeleine Leisner"", ""Leonidas Bleris"", ""Jason Lohmueller"", ""Zhen Xie"", ""Yaakov Benenson""]","Leisner, M., Bleris, L., Lohmueller, J. et al.

letter,An index for characterization of nanomaterials in biological systems,"<p>In a physiological environment, nanoparticles selectively absorb proteins to form &#8216;nanoparticle&#8211;protein coronas&#8217;, a process governed by molecular interactions between chemical groups on the nanoparticle surfaces and the amino-acid residues of the proteins. Here, we propose a biological surface adsorption index to characterize these interactions by quantifying the competitive adsorption of a set of small molecule probes onto the nanoparticles. The adsorption properties of nanomaterials are assumed to be governed by Coulomb forces, London dispersion, hydrogen-bond acidity and basicity, polarizability and lone-pair electrons. Adsorption coefficients of the probe compounds were measured and used to create a set of nanodescriptors representing the contributions and relative strengths of each molecular interaction. The method successfully predicted the adsorption of various small molecules onto carbon nanotubes, and the nanodescriptors were also measured for 12 other nanomaterials.

These cubic nanoscaffolds are only &#8764;13 nm in diameter and are composed of short oligonucleotides, making them amenable to chemical synthesis, point modifications and further functionalization. Nanocube assembly is verified by gel assays, dynamic light scattering and cryogenic electron microscopy. Formation of functional RNA nanocubes is also demonstrated by incorporation of a light-up fluorescent RNA aptamer that is optimally active only upon full RNA assembly. Moreover, we show that the RNA nanoscaffolds can self-assemble in isothermal conditions (37 &#176;C) during in vitro transcription, which opens a route towards the construction of sensors, programmable packaging and cargo delivery systems for biomedical applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Kirill A.

Several reports have described the in vivo toxicity of carbon nanotubes, but their effects on male reproduction have not been examined. Here, we show that repeated intravenous injections of water-soluble multiwalled carbon nanotubes into male mice can cause reversible testis damage without affecting fertility. Nanotubes accumulated in the testes, generated oxidative stress and decreased the thickness of the seminiferous epithelium in the testis at day 15, but the damage was repaired at 60 and 90 days. The quantity, quality and integrity of the sperm and the levels of three major sex hormones were not significantly affected throughout the 90-day period.
