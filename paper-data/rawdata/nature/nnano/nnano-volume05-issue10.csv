review article,Hybrid superconductor–quantum dot devices,"<p>Advances in nanofabrication techniques have made it possible to make devices in which superconducting electrodes are connected to non-superconducting nanostructures such as quantum dots. The properties of these hybrid devices result from a combination of a macroscopic quantum phenomenon involving large numbers of electrons (superconductivity) and the ability to control single electrons, offered by quantum dots. Here we review research into electron transport and other fundamental processes that have been studied in these devices. We also describe potential applications, such as a transistor in which the direction of a supercurrent can be reversed by adding just one electron to a quantum dot.</p>",,"[{'address': 'SPSMS/LaTEQS, CEA-INAC/UJF-Grenoble 1, 17 Rue des Martyrs, Grenoble, 38054, Cedex 9, France', 'authors': ['Silvano De Franceschi']}, {'address': 'Kavli Institute of NanoScience, Delft University of Technology, PO Box 5046, Delft, 2600 GA, the Netherlands', 'authors': ['Leo Kouwenhoven']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Basel, Klingelbergstr. 82, Basel, CH-4056, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Christian Schönenberger']}, {'address': ""Institut Néel, associé à l'UJF, CNRS, BP 166, Grenoble, 38042, Cedex 9, France"", 'authors': ['Wolfgang Wernsdorfer']}]",False,"['Silvano De Franceschi', 'Leo Kouwenhoven', 'Christian Schönenberger', 'Wolfgang Wernsdorfer']","De Franceschi, S., Kouwenhoven, L., Schönenberger, C. et al.

letter,Folding and cutting DNA into reconfigurable topological nanostructures,"<p>Topology is the mathematical study of the spatial properties that are preserved through the deformation, twisting and stretching of objects. Topological architectures are common in nature and can be seen, for example, in DNA molecules that condense and relax during cellular events. Synthetic topological nanostructures, such as catenanes and rotaxanes, have been engineered using supramolecular chemistry, but the fabrication of complex and reconfigurable structures remains challenging. Here, we show that DNA origami can be used to assemble a M&#246;bius strip, a topological ribbon-like structure that has only one side. In addition, we show that the DNA M&#246;bius strip can be reconfigured through strand displacement to create topological objects such as supercoiled ring and catenane structures. This DNA fold-and-cut strategy, analogous to Japanese kirigami, may be used to create and reconfigure programmable topological structures that are unprecedented in molecular engineering.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Single Molecule Biophysics, The Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, 85287, Arizona, USA', 'authors': ['Dongran Han', ',\xa0Suchetan Pal', ',\xa0Yan Liu', '\xa0&\xa0Hao Yan']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Arizona State University, Tempe, 85287, Arizona, USA', 'authors': ['Dongran Han', ',\xa0Suchetan Pal', ',\xa0Yan Liu', '\xa0&\xa0Hao Yan']}]",False,"['Dongran Han', 'Suchetan Pal', 'Yan Liu', 'Hao Yan']","Han, D., Pal, S., Liu, Y. et al.

letter,Reduction of thermal conductivity in phononic nanomesh structures,"<p>Controlling the thermal conductivity of a material independently of its electrical conductivity continues to be a goal for researchers working on thermoelectric materials for use in energy applications and in the cooling of integrated circuits. In principle, the thermal conductivity &#954; and the electrical conductivity &#963; may be independently optimized in semiconducting nanostructures because different length scales are associated with phonons (which carry heat) and electric charges (which carry current). Phonons are scattered at surfaces and interfaces, so &#954; generally decreases as the surface-to-volume ratio increases. In contrast, &#963; is less sensitive to a decrease in nanostructure size, although at sufficiently small sizes it will degrade through the scattering of charge carriers at interfaces. Here, we demonstrate an approach to independently controlling &#954; based on altering the phonon band structure of a semiconductor thin film through the formation of a phononic nanomesh film. These films are patterned with periodic spacings that are comparable to, or shorter than, the phonon mean free path. The nanomesh structure exhibits a substantially lower thermal conductivity than an equivalently prepared array of silicon nanowires, even though this array has a significantly higher surface-to-volume ratio. Bulk-like electrical conductivity is preserved. We suggest that this development is a step towards a coherent mechanism for lowering thermal conductivity.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, MC 127-72 1200 East California Boulevard, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, 91125, California, USA', 'authors': ['Jen-Kan Yu', ',\xa0Slobodan Mitrovic', ',\xa0Douglas Tham', ',\xa0Joseph Varghese', '\xa0&\xa0James R.

letter,Boron nitride substrates for high-quality graphene electronics,"<p>Graphene devices on standard SiO<sub>2</sub> substrates are highly disordered, exhibiting characteristics that are far inferior to the expected intrinsic properties of graphene. Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality, this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO<sub>2</sub>. These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, New York, USA', 'authors': ['C.

letter,Scalable templated growth of graphene nanoribbons on SiC,"<p>In spite of its excellent electronic properties, the use of graphene in field-effect transistors is not practical at room temperature without modification of its intrinsically semimetallic nature to introduce a bandgap. Quantum confinement effects can create a bandgap in graphene nanoribbons, but existing nanoribbon fabrication methods are slow and often produce disordered edges that compromise electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate the self-organized growth of graphene nanoribbons on a templated silicon carbide substrate prepared using scalable photolithography and microelectronics processing. Direct nanoribbon growth avoids the need for damaging post-processing. Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electrostatic force microscopy confirm that nanoribbons as narrow as 40&#160;nm can be grown at specified positions on the substrate. Our prototype graphene devices exhibit quantum confinement at low temperatures (4&#160;K), and an on&#8211;off ratio of 10 and carrier mobilities up to 2,700&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at room temperature.

letter,Optical rectification and field enhancement in a plasmonic nanogap,"<p>Metal nanostructures act as powerful optical antennas because collective modes of the electron fluid in the metal are excited when light strikes the surface of the nanostructure. These excitations, known as plasmons, can have evanescent electromagnetic fields that are orders of magnitude larger than the incident electromagnetic field. The largest field enhancements often occur in nanogaps between plasmonically active nanostructures, but it is extremely challenging to measure the fields in such gaps directly. These enhanced fields have applications in surface-enhanced spectroscopies, nonlinear optics and nanophotonics. Here we show that nonlinear tunnelling conduction between gold electrodes separated by a subnanometre gap leads to optical rectification, producing a d.c. photocurrent when the gap is illuminated. Comparing this photocurrent with low-frequency conduction measurements, we determine the optical frequency voltage across the tunnelling region of the nanogap, and also the enhancement of the electric field in the tunnelling region, as a function of gap size. The measured field enhancements exceed 1,000, consistent with estimates from surface-enhanced Raman measurements. Our results highlight the need for more realistic theoretical approaches that are able to model the electromagnetic response of metal nanostructures on scales ranging from the free-space wavelength, &#955;, down to &#8764;&#955;/1,000, and for experiments with new materials, different wavelengths and different incident polarizations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, 77005, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Daniel R.

letter,Direct observation of single-charge-detection capability of nanowire field-effect transistors,"<p>A single localized charge can quench the luminescence of a semiconductor nanowire, but relatively little is known about the effect of single charges on the conductance of the nanowire. In one-dimensional nanostructures embedded in a material with a low dielectric permittivity, the Coulomb interaction and excitonic binding energy are much larger than the corresponding values when embedded in a material with the same dielectric permittivity. The stronger Coulomb interaction is also predicted to limit the carrier mobility in nanowires. Here, we experimentally isolate and study the effect of individual localized electrons on carrier transport in InAs nanowire field-effect transistors, and extract the equivalent charge sensitivity. In the low carrier density regime, the electrostatic potential produced by one electron can create an insulating weak link in an otherwise conducting nanowire field-effect transistor, modulating its conductance by as much as 4,200% at 31&#160;K. The equivalent charge sensitivity, 4&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>&#160;e&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> at 25&#160;K and 6&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>&#160;e&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> at 198&#160;K, is orders of magnitude better than conventional field-effect transistors and nanoelectromechanical systems, and is just a factor of 20&#8211;30 away from the record sensitivity for state-of-the-art single-electron transistors operating below 4&#160;K (ref.&#160;). This work demonstrates the feasibility of nanowire-based single-electron memories and illustrates a physical process of potential relevance for high performance chemical sensors. The charge-state-detection capability we demonstrate also makes the nanowire field-effect transistor a promising host system for impurities (which may be introduced intentionally or unintentionally) with potentially long spin lifetimes, because such transistors offer more sensitive spin-to-charge conversion readout than schemes based on conventional field-effect transistors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Centre for Advanced Nanotechnology, University of Toronto, 170 College Street, Toronto, M5S 3E3, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['J.
