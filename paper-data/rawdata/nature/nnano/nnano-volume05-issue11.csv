letter,Exciton-like trap states limit electron mobility in TiO2 nanotubes,"<p>Nanoparticle films have become a promising low-cost, high-surface-area electrode material for solar cells and solar fuel production. Compared to sintered nanoparticle films, oriented polycrystalline titania nanotubes offer the advantage of directed electron transport, and are expected to have higher electron mobility. However, macroscopic measurements have revealed their electron mobility to be as low as that of nanoparticle films. Here, we show, through time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy, that low mobility in polycrystalline TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes is not due to scattering from grain boundaries or disorder-induced localization as in other nanomaterials, but instead results from a single sharp resonance arising from exciton-like trap states. If the number of these states can be lowered, this could lead to improved electron transport in titania nanotubes and significantly better solar cell performance.</p>",[],False,"[""Christiaan Richter"", ""Charles A.

letter,Training a molecular automaton to play a game,"<p>Research at the interface between chemistry and cybernetics has led to reports of &#8216;programmable molecules&#8217;, but what does it mean to say &#8216;we programmed a set of solution-phase molecules to do X&#8217;? A survey of recently implemented solution-phase circuitry indicates that this statement could be replaced with &#8216;we pre-mixed a set of molecules to do X and functional subsets of X&#8217;. These hard-wired mixtures are then exposed to a set of molecular inputs, which can be interpreted as being keyed to human moves in a game, or as assertions of logical propositions. In nucleic acids-based systems, stemming from DNA computation, these inputs can be seen as generic oligonucleotides. Here, we report using reconfigurable nucleic acid catalyst-based units to build a multipurpose reprogrammable molecular automaton that goes beyond single-purpose &#8216;hard-wired&#8217; molecular automata. The automaton covers all possible responses to two consecutive sets of four inputs (such as four first and four second moves for a generic set of trivial two-player two-move games). This is a model system for more general molecular field programmable gate array (FPGA)-like devices that can be programmed by example, which means that the operator need not have any knowledge of molecular computing methods.</p>",[],False,"[""Renjun Pei"", ""Elizabeth Matamoros"", ""Manhong Liu"", ""Darko Stefanovic"", ""Milan N.

letter,Autonomous multistep organic synthesis in a single isothermal solution mediated by a DNA walker,"<p>Multistep synthesis in the laboratory typically requires numerous reaction vessels, each containing a different set of reactants. In contrast, cells are capable of performing highly efficient and selective multistep biosynthesis under mild conditions with all reactants simultaneously present in solution. If the latter approach could be applied in the laboratory, it could improve the ease, speed and efficiency of multistep reaction sequences. Here, we show that a DNA mechanical device&#8212;a DNA walker moving along a DNA track&#8212;can be used to perform a series of amine acylation reactions in a single solution without any external intervention. The products of these reactions are programmed by the sequence of the DNA track, but they are not related to the structure of DNA. Moreover, they are formed with speeds and overall yields that are significantly greater than those previously achieved by multistep DNA-templated small-molecule synthesis.</p>",[],False,"[""Yu He"", ""David R.

letter,Ultrasensitive detection and characterization of biomolecules using superchiral fields,"<p>The spectroscopic analysis of large biomolecules is important in applications such as biomedical diagnostics and pathogen detection, and spectroscopic techniques can detect such molecules at the nanogram level or lower. However, spectroscopic techniques have not been able to probe the structure of large biomolecules with similar levels of sensitivity. Here, we show that superchiral electromagnetic fields, generated by the optical excitation of plasmonic planar chiral metamaterials, are highly sensitive probes of chiral supramolecular structure. The differences in the effective refractive indices of chiral samples exposed to left- and right-handed superchiral fields are found to be up to 10<sup>6</sup> times greater than those observed in optical polarimetry measurements, thus allowing picogram quantities of adsorbed molecules to be characterized. The largest differences are observed for biomolecules that have chiral planar sheets, such as proteins with high &#946;-sheet content, which suggests that this approach could form the basis for assaying technologies capable of detecting amyloid diseases and certain types of viruses.</p>",[],False,"[""E.

letter,Nanomechanical recognition measurements of individual DNA molecules reveal epigenetic methylation patterns,"<p>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool for analysing the shapes of individual molecules and the forces acting on them. AFM-based force spectroscopy provides insights into the structural and energetic dynamics of biomolecules by probing the interactions within individual molecules, or between a surface-bound molecule and a cantilever that carries a complementary binding partner. Here, we show that an AFM cantilever with an antibody tether can measure the distances between 5-methylcytidine bases in individual DNA strands with a resolution of 4&#160;&#197;, thereby revealing the DNA methylation pattern, which has an important role in the epigenetic control of gene expression. The antibody is able to bind two 5-methylcytidine bases of a surface-immobilized DNA strand, and retracting the cantilever results in a unique rupture signature reflecting the spacing between two tagged bases. This nanomechanical approach might also allow related chemical patterns to be retrieved from biopolymers at the single-molecule level.</p>",[],False,"[""Rong Zhu"", ""Stefan Howorka"", ""Johannes Pr\u00f6ll"", ""Ferry Kienberger"", ""Johannes Preiner"", ""Jan Hesse"", ""Andreas Ebner"", ""Vassili Ph.

To date, this phenomenon has mainly been observed in insulating materials such as complex multiferroic oxides. Bulk metallic systems do not exhibit magnetoelectric coupling, because applied electric fields are screened by conduction electrons. We demonstrate strong magnetoelectric coupling at the surface of thin iron films using the electric field from a scanning tunnelling microscope, and are able to write, store and read information to areas with sides of a few nanometres.

article,Replication of individual DNA molecules under electronic control using a protein nanopore,"<p>Nanopores can be used to analyse DNA by monitoring ion currents as individual strands are captured and driven through the pore in single file by an applied voltage. Here, we show that serial replication of individual DNA templates can be achieved by DNA polymerases held at the &#945;-haemolysin nanopore orifice. Replication is blocked in the bulk phase, and is initiated only after the DNA is captured by the nanopore. We used this method, in concert with active voltage control, to observe DNA replication catalysed by bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (T7DNAP) and by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (KF). T7DNAP advanced on a DNA template against an 80-mV load applied across the nanopore, and single nucleotide additions were measured on the millisecond timescale for hundreds of individual DNA molecules in series. Replication by KF was not observed when this enzyme was held on top of the nanopore orifice at an applied potential of 80&#160;mV.

article,Rapid electronic detection of probe-specific microRNAs using thin nanopore sensors,"<p>Small RNA molecules have an important role in gene regulation and RNA silencing therapy, but it is challenging to detect these molecules without the use of time-consuming radioactive labelling assays or error-prone amplification methods. Here, we present a platform for the rapid electronic detection of probe-hybridized microRNAs from cellular RNA. In this platform, a target microRNA is first hybridized to a probe. This probe:microRNA duplex is then enriched through binding to the viral protein p19. Finally, the abundance of the duplex is quantified using a nanopore. Reducing the thickness of the membrane containing the nanopore to 6&#160;nm leads to increased signal amplitudes from biomolecules, and reducing the diameter of the nanopore to 3&#160;nm allows the detection and discrimination of small nucleic acids based on differences in their physical dimensions.
