review article,The emerging field of RNA nanotechnology,"<p>Like DNA, RNA can be designed and manipulated to produce a variety of different nanostructures. Moreover, RNA has a flexible structure and possesses catalytic functions that are similar to proteins. Although RNA nanotechnology resembles DNA nanotechnology in many ways, the base-pairing rules for constructing nanoparticles are different. The large variety of loops and motifs found in RNA allows it to fold into numerous complicated structures, and this diversity provides a platform for identifying viable building blocks for various applications. The thermal stability of RNA also allows the production of multivalent nanostructures with defined stoichiometry. Here we review techniques for constructing RNA nanoparticles from different building blocks, we describe the distinct attributes of RNA inside the body, and discuss potential applications of RNA nanostructures in medicine. We also offer some perspectives on the yield and cost of RNA production.</p>",[],False,"[""Peixuan Guo""]","Guo, P. The emerging field of RNA nanotechnology.

letter,Towards full-structure determination of bimetallic nanoparticles with an aberration-corrected electron microscope,"<p>To fully understand the properties of functional nanostructures such as catalytic nanoclusters, it is necessary to know the positions of all the atoms in the nanostructure. The catalytic properties of metal nanoclusters can often be improved by the addition of a second metal, but little is known about the role of the different metals in these bimetallic catalysts, or about their interactions with each other and the support material. Here we show that aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy of supported rhodium&#8211;iridium clusters, combined with dynamic multislice image simulations, can identify individual atoms, map the full structure, and determine changes in the positions of metal atoms in sequential images. This approach could help in the development of new and improved catalysts and other functional nanostructures.</p>",[],False,"[""Volkan Ortalan"", ""Alper Uzun"", ""Bruce C. Gates"", ""Nigel D.

letter,Anomalous ion transport in 2-nm hydrophilic nanochannels,"<p>Transmembrane proteins often contain nanoscale channels through which ions and molecules can pass either passively (by diffusion) or actively (by means of forced transport). These proteins play important roles in selective mass transport and electrical signalling in many biological processes. Fluidic nanochannels that are 1&#8211;2&#160;nm in diameter act as functional mimics of protein channels, and have been used to explore the transport of ions and molecules in confined liquids. Here we report ion transport in 2-nm-deep nanochannels fabricated by standard semiconductor manufacturing processes. Ion transport in these nanochannels is dominated by surface charge until the ion concentration exceeds 100&#160;mM. At low concentrations, proton mobility increases by a factor of four over the bulk value, possibly due to overlapping of the hydrogen-bonding network of the two hydration layers adjacent to the hydrophilic surfaces. The mobility of K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ions also increases as the bulk concentration decreases, although the reasons for this are not completely understood.</p>",[],False,"[""Chuanhua Duan"", ""Arun Majumdar""]","Duan, C., Majumdar, A.

letter,"Highly conductive, printable and stretchable composite films of carbon nanotubes and silver","<p>Conductive films that are both stretchable and flexible could have applications in electronic devices, sensors, actuators and speakers. A substantial amount of research has been carried out on conductive polymer composites, metal electrode-integrated rubber substrates and materials based on carbon nanotubes and graphene. Here we present highly conductive, printable and stretchable hybrid composites composed of micrometre-sized silver flakes and multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with self-assembled silver nanoparticles. The nanotubes were used as one-dimensional, flexible and conductive scaffolds to construct effective electrical networks among the silver flakes. The nanocomposites, which included polyvinylidenefluoride copolymer, were created with a hot-rolling technique, and the maximum conductivities of the hybrid silver&#8211;nanotube composites were 5,710&#160;S&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 0% strain and 20&#160;S&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 140% strain, at which point the film ruptured.

letter,Length scaling of carbon nanotube transistors,"<p>Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors are strong candidates in replacing or supplementing silicon technology. Although theoretical studies have projected that nanotube transistors will perform well at nanoscale device dimensions, most experimental studies have been carried out on devices that are about ten times larger than current silicon transistors. Here, we show that nanotube transistors maintain their performance as their channel length is scaled from 3&#160;&#181;m to 15&#160;nm, with an absence of so-called short-channel effects. The 15-nm device has the shortest channel length and highest room-temperature conductance (0.7G<sub>0</sub>) and transconductance (40&#160;&#181;S) of any nanotube transistor reported to date. We also show the first experimental evidence that nanotube device performance depends significantly on contact length, in contrast to some previous reports. Data for both channel and contact length scaling were gathered by constructing multiple devices on a single carbon nanotube. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of a nanotube transistor with channel and contact lengths of 20&#160;nm, an on-current of 10&#160;&#181;A, an on/off current ratio of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup>, and peak transconductance of 20&#160;&#181;S. These results provide an experimental forecast for carbon nanotube device performance at dimensions suitable for future transistor technology nodes.</p>",[],False,"[""Aaron D.

letter,Electroluminescence from a single nanotube–molecule–nanotube junction,"<p>The positioning of single molecules between nanoscale electrodes has allowed their use as functional units in electronic devices. Although the electrical transport in such devices has been widely explored, optical measurements have been restricted to the observation of electroluminescence from nanocrystals and nanoclusters and from molecules in a scanning tunnelling microscope setup. In this Letter, we report the observation of electroluminescence from the core of a rod-like molecule between two metallic single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes forming a rigid solid-state device. We also develop a simple model to explain the onset voltage for electroluminescence.

letter,Identifying single bases in a DNA oligomer with electron tunnelling,"<p>It has been proposed that single molecules of DNA could be sequenced by measuring the physical properties of the bases as they pass through a nanopore. Theoretical calculations suggest that electron tunnelling can identify bases in single-stranded DNA without enzymatic processing, and it was recently experimentally shown that tunnelling can sense individual nucleotides and nucleosides. Here, we report that tunnelling electrodes functionalized with recognition reagents can identify a single base flanked by other bases in short DNA oligomers. The residence time of a single base in a recognition junction is on the order of a second, but pulling the DNA through the junction with a force of tens of piconewtons would yield reading speeds of tens of bases per second.</p>",[],False,"[""Shuo Huang"", ""Jin He"", ""Shuai Chang"", ""Peiming Zhang"", ""Feng Liang"", ""Shengqin Li"", ""Michael Tuchband"", ""Alexander Fuhrmann"", ""Robert Ros"", ""Stuart Lindsay""]","Huang, S., He, J., Chang, S. et al.

letter,Hybrid pore formation by directed insertion of α-haemolysin into solid-state nanopores,"<p>Most experiments on nanopores have concentrated on the pore-forming protein &#945;-haemolysin (&#945;HL) and on artificial pores in solid-state membranes. While biological pores offer an atomically precise structure and the potential for genetic engineering, solid-state nanopores offer durability, size and shape control, and are also better suited for integration into wafer-scale devices. However, each system has significant limitations: &#945;HL is difficult to integrate because it relies on delicate lipid bilayers for mechanical support, and the fabrication of solid-state nanopores with precise dimensions remains challenging. Here we show that these limitations may be overcome by inserting a single &#945;HL pore into a solid-state nanopore. A double-stranded DNA attached to the protein pore is threaded into a solid-state nanopore by electrophoretic translocation. Protein insertion is observed in 30&#8211;40% of our attempts, and translocation of single-stranded DNA demonstrates that the hybrid nanopore remains functional.

article,Red spectral shift and enhanced quantum efficiency in phonon-free photoluminescence from silicon nanocrystals,"<p>Crystalline silicon is the most important semiconductor material in the electronics industry. However, silicon has poor optical properties because of its indirect bandgap, which prevents the efficient emission and absorption of light. The energy structure of silicon can be manipulated through quantum confinement effects, and the excitonic emission from silicon nanocrystals increases in intensity and shifts to shorter wavelengths (a blueshift) as the size of the nanocrystals is reduced. Here we report experimental evidence for a short-lived visible band in the photoluminescence spectrum of silicon nanocrystals that increases in intensity and shifts to longer wavelengths (a redshift) with smaller nanocrystal sizes. This higher intensity indicates an increased quantum efficiency, which for 2.5-nm-diameter nanocrystals is enhanced by three orders of magnitude compared to bulk silicon. We assign this band to the radiative recombination of non-equilibrium electron&#8211;hole pairs in a process that does not involve phonons.</p>",[],False,"[""W. D. A. M. de Boer"", ""D.
