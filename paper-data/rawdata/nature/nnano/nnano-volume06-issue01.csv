review article,Nanotechnological strategies for engineering complex tissues,"<p>Tissue engineering aims at developing functional substitutes for damaged tissues and organs. Before transplantation, cells are generally seeded on biomaterial scaffolds that recapitulate the extracellular matrix and provide cells with information that is important for tissue development. Here we review the nanocomposite nature of the extracellular matrix, describe the design considerations for different tissues and discuss the impact of nanostructures on the properties of scaffolds and their uses in monitoring the behaviour of engineered tissues.

letter,Atomic-scale engineering of electrodes for single-molecule contacts,"<p>The transport of charge through a conducting material depends on the intrinsic ability of the material to conduct current and on the charge injection efficiency at the contacts between the conductor and the electrodes carrying current to and from the material. According to theoretical considerations, this concept remains valid down to the limit of single-molecule junctions. Exploring this limit in experiments requires atomic-scale control of the junction geometry. Here we present a method for probing the current through a single C<sub>60</sub> molecule while changing, one by one, the number of atoms in the electrode that are in contact with the molecule. We show quantitatively that the contact geometry has a strong influence on the conductance. We also find a crossover from a regime in which the conductance is limited by charge injection at the contact to a regime in which the conductance is limited by scattering at the molecule. Thus, the concepts of &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217; contacts, commonly used in macro- and mesoscopic physics, can also be applied at the molecular scale.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut de Physique et Chimie des Matériaux de Strasbourg, UMR 7504 (CNRS – Université de Strasbourg), Strasbourg, 67034, France', 'authors': ['Guillaume Schull']}, {'address': 'Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC), San Sebastián, 20018, Spain', 'authors': ['Thomas Frederiksen', ',\xa0Andrés Arnau', '\xa0&\xa0Daniel Sánchez-Portal']}, {'address': 'Centro de Fisica de Materiales CSIC-UPV/EHU, Materials Physics Center MPC, San Sebastián, 20080, Spain', 'authors': ['Andrés Arnau', '\xa0&\xa0Daniel Sánchez-Portal']}, {'address': 'Depto.

letter,Freestanding palladium nanosheets with plasmonic and catalytic properties,"<p>Ultrathin metal films can exhibit quantum size and surface effects that give rise to unique physical and chemical properties. Metal films containing just a few layers of atoms can be fabricated on substrates using deposition techniques, but the production of freestanding ultrathin structures remains a significant challenge. Here we report the facile synthesis of freestanding hexagonal palladium nanosheets that are less than 10 atomic layers thick, using carbon monoxide as a surface confining agent. The as-prepared nanosheets are blue in colour and exhibit a well-defined but tunable surface plasmon resonance peak in the near-infrared region. The combination of photothermal stability and biocompatibility makes palladium nanosheets promising candidates for photothermal therapy. The nanosheets also exhibit electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid that is 2.5 times greater than that of commercial palladium black catalyst.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China', 'authors': ['Xiaoqing Huang', ',\xa0Shaoheng Tang', ',\xa0Xiaoliang Mu', ',\xa0Yan Dai', ',\xa0Guangxu Chen', ',\xa0Zhiyou Zhou', '\xa0&\xa0Nanfeng Zheng']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China', 'authors': ['Fangxiong Ruan', '\xa0&\xa0Zhilin Yang']}]",False,"['Xiaoqing Huang', 'Shaoheng Tang', 'Xiaoliang Mu', 'Yan Dai', 'Guangxu Chen', 'Zhiyou Zhou', 'Fangxiong Ruan', 'Zhilin Yang', 'Nanfeng Zheng']","Huang, X., Tang, S., Mu, X. et al.

letter,Vibrational and electronic heating in nanoscale junctions,"<p>Understanding and controlling the flow of heat is a major challenge in nanoelectronics. When a junction is driven out of equilibrium by light or the flow of electric charge, the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom are, in general, no longer described by a single temperature. Moreover, characterizing the steady-state vibrational and electronic distributions in situ is extremely challenging. Here, we show that surface-enhanced Raman emission may be used to determine the effective temperatures for both the vibrational modes and the electrons in the current in a biased metallic nanoscale junction decorated with molecules. Molecular vibrations show mode-specific pumping by both optical excitation and d.c. current, with effective temperatures exceeding several hundred kelvin. Anti-Stokes electronic Raman emission indicates that the effective electronic temperature at bias voltages of a few hundred millivolts can reach values up to three times the values measured when there is no current. The precise effective temperatures are model-dependent, but the trends as a function of bias conditions are robust, and allow direct comparisons with theories of nanoscale heating.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, 77005, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Daniel R.

letter,Nanoparticle-induced unfolding of fibrinogen promotes Mac-1 receptor activation and inflammation,"<p>The chemical composition, size, shape and surface characteristics of nanoparticles affect the way proteins bind to these particles, and this in turn influences the way in which nanoparticles interact with cells and tissues. Nanomaterials bound with proteins can result in physiological and pathological changes, including macrophage uptake, blood coagulation, protein aggregation and complement activation, but the mechanisms that lead to these changes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)-conjugated gold nanoparticles bind to and induce unfolding of fibrinogen, which promotes interaction with the integrin receptor, Mac-1. Activation of this receptor increases the NF-&#954;B signalling pathway, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, not all nanoparticles that bind to fibrinogen demonstrated this effect. Our results show that the binding of certain nanoparticles to fibrinogen in plasma offers an alternative mechanism to the more commonly described role of oxidative stress in the inflammatory response to nanomaterials.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, 4072, Australia', 'authors': ['Zhou J.

article,Large intrinsic energy bandgaps in annealed nanotube-derived graphene nanoribbons,"<p>The usefulness of graphene for electronics has been limited because it does not have an energy bandgap. Although graphene nanoribbons have non-zero bandgaps, lithographic fabrication methods introduce defects that decouple the bandgap from electronic properties, compromising performance. Here we report direct measurements of a large intrinsic energy bandgap of &#8764;50 meV in nanoribbons (width, &#8764;100 nm) fabricated by high-temperature hydrogen-annealing of unzipped carbon nanotubes. The thermal energy required to promote a charge to the conduction band (the activation energy) is measured to be seven times greater than in lithographically defined nanoribbons, and is close to the width of the voltage range over which differential conductance is zero (the transport gap). This similarity suggests that the activation energy is in fact the intrinsic energy bandgap. High-resolution transmission electron and Raman microscopy, in combination with an absence of hopping conductance and stochastic charging effects, suggest a low defect density.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Faculty of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University, 5-10-1 Fuchinobe, Sagamihara, 252-5258, Kanagawa, Japan', 'authors': ['T.

article,Single-walled carbon nanotubes as excitonic optical wires,"<p>Although metallic nanostructures are useful for nanoscale optics, all of their key optical properties are determined by their geometry. This makes it difficult to adjust these properties independently, and can restrict applications. Here we use the absolute intensity of Rayleigh scattering to show that single-walled carbon nanotubes can form ideal optical wires. The spatial distribution of the radiation scattered by the nanotubes is determined by their shape, but the intensity and spectrum of the scattered radiation are determined by exciton dynamics, quantum-dot-like optical resonances and other intrinsic properties. Moreover, the nanotubes display a uniform peak optical conductivity of &#8764;8 e<sup>2</sup>/h, which we derive using an exciton model, suggesting universal behaviour similar to that observed in nanotube conductance. We further demonstrate a radiative coupling between two distant nanotubes, with potential applications in metamaterials and optical antennas.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Daniel Y.

article,Biomagnification of cadmium selenide quantum dots in a simple experimental microbial food chain,"<p>Previous studies have shown that engineered nanomaterials can be transferred from prey to predator, but the ecological impacts of this are mostly unknown. In particular, it is not known if these materials can be biomagnified&#8212;a process in which higher concentrations of materials accumulate in organisms higher up in the food chain. Here, we show that bare CdSe quantum dots that have accumulated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria can be transferred to and biomagnified in the Tetrahymena thermophila protozoa that prey on the bacteria. Cadmium concentrations in the protozoa predator were approximately five times higher than their bacterial prey. Quantum-dot-treated bacteria were differentially toxic to the protozoa, in that they inhibited their own digestion in the protozoan food vacuoles. Because the protozoa did not lyse, largely intact quantum dots remain available to higher trophic levels. The observed biomagnification from bacterial prey is significant because bacteria are at the base of environmental food webs. Our findings illustrate the potential for biomagnification as an ecological impact of nanomaterials.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, 93106-9625, California, USA', 'authors': ['R.
