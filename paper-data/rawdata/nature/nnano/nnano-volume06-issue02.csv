letter,Visualization of the self-assembly of silica nanochannels reveals growth mechanism,"<p>Self-assembled mesoporous structures with well-ordered nanoscale channels could be used in applications such as molecular separation, nano-optics, molecular electronics, nanomedicine and catalysis. However, the domain sizes that can be created in such systems are limited by our lack of a detailed understanding of the relevant growth processes. Here we report the real-time observation of domain growth in the self-assembly of silica nanochannels using fluorescence polarization imaging and atomic force microscopy. We show that transient lamellar structures precede the formation of hexagonal layers, and that the layer growth follows two distinct pathways. In addition, the domains are grown on a mesoporous film substrate, which acts as a sieve and allows control of the delivery of the reactive species. We use these insights and capabilities to grow layers of well-ordered silica nanochannels with domain sizes of up to &#8764;0.3 mm.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Center for Nanoscience (CeNS), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Butenandtstrasse 11, München, 81377, Germany', 'authors': ['Christophe Jung', ',\xa0Peter Schwaderer', ',\xa0Mark Dethlefsen', ',\xa0Ralf Köhn', ',\xa0Jens Michaelis', '\xa0&\xa0Christoph Bräuchle']}]",False,"['Christophe Jung', 'Peter Schwaderer', 'Mark Dethlefsen', 'Ralf Köhn', 'Jens Michaelis', 'Christoph Bräuchle']","Jung, C., Schwaderer, P., Dethlefsen, M. et al.

letter,"Time-dependent, protein-directed growth of gold nanoparticles within a single crystal of lysozyme","<p>Gold nanoparticles are useful in biomedical applications due to their distinct optical properties and high chemical stability. Reports of the biogenic formation of gold colloids from gold complexes has also led to an increased level of interest in the biomineralization of gold. However, the mechanism responsible for biomolecule-directed gold nanoparticle formation remains unclear due to the lack of structural information about biological systems and the fast kinetics of biomimetic chemical systems in solution. Here we show that intact single crystals of lysozyme can be used to study the time-dependent, protein-directed growth of gold nanoparticles. The protein crystals slow down the growth of the gold nanoparticles, allowing detailed kinetic studies to be carried out, and permit a three-dimensional structural characterization that would be difficult to achieve in solution. Furthermore, we show that additional chemical species can be used to fine-tune the growth rate of the gold nanoparticles.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Hui Wei', ',\xa0Limin Yang', ',\xa0Li Huey Tan', ',\xa0Hang Xing', '\xa0&\xa0Yi Lu']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Zidong Wang', ',\xa0Jiong Zhang', ',\xa0Stephen House', ',\xa0Ian M.

letter,Large field-induced strains in a lead-free piezoelectric material,"<p>Piezoelectric materials exhibit a mechanical response to electrical inputs, as well as an electrical response to mechanical inputs, which makes them useful in sensors and actuators. Lead-based piezoelectrics demonstrate a large mechanical response, but they also pose a health risk. The ferroelectric BiFeO<sub>3</sub> is an attractive alternative because it is lead-free, and because strain can stabilize BiFeO<sub>3</sub> phases with a structure that resembles a morphotropic phase boundary. Here we report a reversible electric-field-induced strain of over 5% in BiFeO<sub>3</sub> films, together with a characterization of the origins of this effect. In situ transmission electron microscopy coupled with nanoscale electrical and mechanical probing shows that large strains result from moving the boundaries between tetragonal- and rhombohedral-like phases, which changes the phase stability of the mixture. These results demonstrate the potential of BiFeO<sub>3</sub> as a substitute for lead-based materials in future piezoelectric applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Green light stimulates terahertz emission from mesocrystal microspheres,"<p>The discovery of efficient sources of terahertz radiation has been exploited in imaging applications, and developing a nanoscale terahertz source could lead to additional applications. High-frequency mechanical vibrations of charged nanostructures can lead to radiative emission, and vibrations at frequencies of hundreds of kilohertz have been observed from a ZnO nanobelt under the influence of an alternating electric field. Here, we observe mechanical resonance and radiative emission at &#8764;0.36 THz from core&#8211;shell ZnO mesocrystal microspheres excited by a continuous green-wavelength laser. We find that &#8764;0.016% of the incident power is converted into terahertz radiation, which corresponds to a quantum efficiency of &#8764;33%, making the ZnO microspheres competitive with existing terahertz-emitting materials. The mechanical resonance and radiation stem from the coherent photo-induced vibration of the hexagonal ZnO nanoplates that make up the microsphere shells. The ZnO microspheres are formed by means of a nonclassical, self-organized crystallization process, and represent a straightforward route to terahertz radiation at the nanoscale.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures and Department of Physics, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China', 'authors': ['X.

letter,Designed ultrafast optical nonlinearity in a plasmonic nanorod metamaterial enhanced by nonlocality,"<p>All-optical signal processing enables modulation and transmission speeds not achievable using electronics alone. However, its practical applications are limited by the inherently weak nonlinear effects that govern photon&#8211;photon interactions in conventional materials, particularly at high switching rates. Here, we show that the recently discovered nonlocal optical behaviour of plasmonic nanorod metamaterials enables an enhanced, ultrafast, nonlinear optical response. We observe a large (80%) change of transmission through a subwavelength thick slab of metamaterial subjected to a low control light fluence of 7&#160;mJ&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, with switching frequencies in the terahertz range. We show that both the response time and the nonlinearity can be engineered by appropriate design of the metamaterial nanostructure. The use of nonlocality to enhance the nonlinear optical response of metamaterials, demonstrated here in plasmonic nanorod composites, could lead to ultrafast, low-power all-optical information processing in subwavelength-scale devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of North Florida, Jacksonville, 32224, Florida, USA', 'authors': ['G.

letter,Quantum oscillations in magnetically doped colloidal nanocrystals,"<p>Progress in the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots has recently provided access to entirely new forms of diluted magnetic semiconductors, some of which may find use in quantum computation. The usefulness of a spin qubit is defined by its Rabi frequency, which determines the operation time, and its coherence time, which sets the error correction window. However, the spin dynamics of magnetic impurity ions in colloidal doped quantum dots remain entirely unexplored. Here, we use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to demonstrate long spin coherence times of &#8764;0.9 &#181;s in colloidal ZnO quantum dots containing the paramagnetic dopant Mn<sup>2+</sup>, as well as Rabi oscillations with frequencies ranging between 2 and 20&#160;MHz depending on microwave power.

Here, we show that pretreating rats with amine-modified single-walled carbon nanotubes can protect neurons and enhance the recovery of behavioural functions in rats with induced stroke. Treated rats showed less tissue damage than controls and took longer to fall from a rotating rod, suggesting better motor functions after injury.

article,Label-free single-molecule detection of DNA-hybridization kinetics with a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor,"<p>Single-molecule measurements of biomolecules can provide information about the molecular interactions and kinetics that are hidden in ensemble measurements. However, there is a requirement for techniques with improved sensitivity and time resolution for use in exploring biomolecular systems with fast dynamics. Here, we report the detection of DNA hybridization at the single-molecule level using a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor. By covalently attaching a single-stranded probe DNA sequence to a point defect in a carbon nanotube, we are able to measure two-level fluctuations in the conductance of the nanotube in the presence of a complementary DNA target. The kinetics of the system are studied as a function of temperature, allowing the measurement of rate constants, melting curves and activation energies for different sequences and target concentrations. The kinetics demonstrate non-Arrhenius behaviour, in agreement with DNA hybridization experiments using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.
