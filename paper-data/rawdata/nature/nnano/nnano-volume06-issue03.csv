letter,A recyclable supramolecular membrane for size-selective separation of nanoparticles,"<p>Most practical materials are held together by covalent bonds, which are irreversible. Materials based on noncovalent interactions can undergo reversible self-assembly, which offers advantages in terms of fabrication, processing and recyclability, but the majority of noncovalent systems are too fragile to be competitive with covalent materials for practical applications, despite significant attempts to develop robust noncovalent arrays. Here, we report nanostructured supramolecular membranes prepared from fibrous assemblies in water. The membranes are robust due to strong hydrophobic interactions, allowing their application in the size-selective separation of both metal and semiconductor nanoparticles. A thin (12 &#181;m) membrane is used for filtration (&#8764;5 nm cutoff), and a thicker (45 &#181;m) membrane allows for size-selective chromatography in the sub-5 nm domain. Unlike conventional membranes, our supramolecular membranes can be disassembled using organic solvent, cleaned, reassembled and reused multiple times.</p>",[],False,"[""Elisha Krieg"", ""Haim Weissman"", ""Elijah Shirman"", ""Eyal Shimoni"", ""Boris Rybtchinski""]","Krieg, E., Weissman, H., Shirman, E. et al.A recyclable supramolecular membrane for size-selective separation of nanoparticles.

letter,Single-layer MoS2 transistors,"<p>Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene, both because of its rich physics and its high mobility. However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors. Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films or requires high voltages. Although single layers of MoS<sub>2</sub> have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV (ref.&#160;), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5&#8211;3&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> range are too low for practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> mobility of at least 200&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>8</sup> and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> has a direct bandgap, it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs, which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors. Monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> could also complement graphene in applications that require thin transparent semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

letter,Plasmonic Luneburg and Eaton lenses,"<p>Plasmonics takes advantage of the properties of surface plasmon polaritons, which are localized or propagating quasiparticles in which photons are coupled to the quasi-free electrons in metals. In particular, plasmonic devices can confine light in regions with dimensions that are smaller than the wavelength of the photons in free space, and this makes it possible to match the different length scales associated with photonics and electronics in a single nanoscale device. Broad applications of plasmonics that have been demonstrated to date include biological sensing, sub-diffraction-limit imaging, focusing and lithography and nano-optical circuitry. Plasmonics-based optical elements such as waveguides, lenses, beamsplitters and reflectors have been implemented by structuring metal surfaces or placing dielectric structures on metals to manipulate the two-dimensional surface plasmon waves. However, the abrupt discontinuities in the material properties or geometries of these elements lead to increased scattering of surface plasmon polaritons, which significantly reduces the efficiency of these components. Transformation optics provides an alternative approach to controlling the propagation of light by spatially varying the optical properties of a material. Here, motivated by this approach, we use grey-scale lithography to adiabatically tailor the topology of a dielectric layer adjacent to a metal surface to demonstrate a plasmonic Luneburg lens that can focus surface plasmon polaritons. We also make a plasmonic Eaton lens that can bend surface plasmon polaritons. Because the optical properties are changed gradually rather than abruptly in these lenses, losses due to scattering can be significantly reduced in comparison with previously reported plasmonic elements.</p>",[],False,"[""Thomas Zentgraf"", ""Yongmin Liu"", ""Maiken H.

letter,Flexible high-performance carbon nanotube integrated circuits,"<p>Carbon nanotube thin-film transistors are expected to enable the fabrication of high-performance, flexible and transparent devices using relatively simple techniques. However, as-grown nanotube networks usually contain both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, which leads to a trade-off between charge-carrier mobility (which increases with greater metallic tube content) and on/off ratio (which decreases). Many approaches to separating metallic nanotubes from semiconducting nanotubes have been investigated, but most lead to contamination and shortening of the nanotubes, thus reducing performance. Here, we report the fabrication of high-performance thin-film transistors and integrated circuits on flexible and transparent substrates using floating-catalyst chemical vapour deposition followed by a simple gas-phase filtration and transfer process. The resulting nanotube network has a well-controlled density and a unique morphology, consisting of long (~10&#160;&#181;m) nanotubes connected by low-resistance Y-shaped junctions. The transistors simultaneously demonstrate a mobility of 35&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8211;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup> and an on/off ratio of 6&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup>.

letter,Fast DNA sequencing with a graphene-based nanochannel device,"<p>Devices in which a single strand of DNA is threaded through a nanopore could be used to efficiently sequence DNA. However, various issues will have to be resolved to make this approach practical, including controlling the DNA translocation rate, suppressing stochastic nucleobase motions, and resolving the signal overlap between different nucleobases. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the feasibility of DNA sequencing using a fluidic nanochannel functionalized with a graphene nanoribbon. This approach involves deciphering the changes that occur in the conductance of the nanoribbon as a result of its interactions with the nucleobases via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. We show that as a DNA strand passes through the nanochannel, the distinct conductance characteristics of the nanoribbon (calculated using a method based on density functional theory coupled to non-equilibrium Green function theory<sup>18&#8211;20</sup>) allow the different nucleobases to be distinguished using a data-mining technique and a two-dimensional transient autocorrelation analysis.

letter,Direct observation of stepwise movement of a synthetic molecular transporter,"<p>Controlled motion at the nanoscale can be achieved by using Watson&#8211;Crick base-pairing to direct the assembly and operation of a molecular transport system consisting of a track, a motor and fuel, all made from DNA. Here, we assemble a 100-nm-long DNA track on a two-dimensional scaffold, and show that a DNA motor loaded at one end of the track moves autonomously and at a constant average speed along the full length of the track, a journey comprising 16 consecutive steps for the motor. Real-time atomic force microscopy allows direct observation of individual steps of a single motor, revealing mechanistic details of its operation. This precisely controlled, long-range transport could lead to the development of systems that could be programmed and routed by instructions encoded in the nucleotide sequences of the track and motor. Such systems might be used to create molecular assembly lines modelled on the ribosome.</p>",[],False,"[""Shelley F. J.

letter,Statistical analysis of nanoparticle dosing in a dynamic cellular system,"<p>The delivery of nanoparticles into cells is important in therapeutic applications and in nanotoxicology. Nanoparticles are generally targeted to receptors on the surfaces of cells and internalized into endosomes by endocytosis, but the kinetics of the process and the way in which cell division redistributes the particles remain unclear. Here we show that the chance of success or failure of nanoparticle uptake and inheritance is random. Statistical analysis of nanoparticle-loaded endosomes indicates that particle capture is described by an over-dispersed Poisson probability distribution that is consistent with heterogeneous adsorption and internalization. Partitioning of nanoparticles in cell division is random and asymmetric, following a binomial distribution with mean probability of 0.52&#8211;0.72. These results show that cellular targeting of nanoparticles is inherently imprecise due to the randomness of nature at the molecular scale, and the statistical framework offers a way to predict nanoparticle dosage for therapy and for the study of nanotoxins.</p>",[],False,"[""Huw D.

letter,Using nano-QSAR to predict the cytotoxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles,"<p>It is expected that the number and variety of engineered nanoparticles will increase rapidly over the next few years, and there is a need for new methods to quickly test the potential toxicity of these materials. Because experimental evaluation of the safety of chemicals is expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have been found to be efficient alternatives for predicting the potential toxicity and environmental impact of new nanomaterials before mass production. Here, we show that the quantitative structure&#8211;activity relationship (QSAR) method commonly used to predict the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds can be applied to predict the toxicity of various metal oxides. Based on experimental testing, we have developed a model to describe the cytotoxicity of 17 different types of metal oxide nanoparticles to bacteria Escherichia coli.

article,The origins and limits of metal–graphene junction resistance,"<p>A high-quality junction between graphene and metallic contacts is crucial in the creation of high-performance graphene transistors. In an ideal metal&#8211;graphene junction, the contact resistance is determined solely by the number of conduction modes in graphene. However, as yet, measurements of contact resistance have been inconsistent, and the factors that determine the contact resistance remain unclear. Here, we report that the contact resistance in a palladium&#8211;graphene junction exhibits an anomalous temperature dependence, dropping significantly as temperature decreases to a value of just 110&#160;&#177;&#160;20&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m at 6&#160;K, which is two to three times the minimum achievable resistance. Using a combination of experiment and theory we show that this behaviour results from carrier transport in graphene under the palladium contact. At low temperature, the carrier mean free path exceeds the palladium&#8211;graphene coupling length, leading to nearly ballistic transport with a transfer efficiency of ~75%. As the temperature increases, this carrier transport becomes less ballistic, resulting in a considerable reduction in efficiency.</p>",[],False,"[""Fengnian Xia"", ""Vasili Perebeinos"", ""Yu-ming Lin"", ""Yanqing Wu"", ""Phaedon Avouris""]","Xia, F., Perebeinos, V., Lin, Ym. et al.

article,Giant magnetoresistance through a single molecule,"<p>Magnetoresistance is a change in the resistance of a material system caused by an applied magnetic field. Giant magnetoresistance occurs in structures containing ferromagnetic contacts separated by a metallic non-magnetic spacer, and is now the basis of read heads for hard drives and for new forms of random access memory. Using an insulator (for example, a molecular thin film) rather than a metal as the spacer gives rise to tunnelling magnetoresistance, which typically produces a larger change in resistance for a given magnetic field strength, but also yields higher resistances, which are a disadvantage for real device operation. Here, we demonstrate giant magnetoresistance across a single, non-magnetic hydrogen phthalocyanine molecule contacted by the ferromagnetic tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. We measure the magnetoresistance to be 60% and the conductance to be 0.26G<sub>0</sub>, where G<sub>0</sub> is the quantum of conductance.
