review article,Comparative advantages of mechanical biosensors,"<p>Mechanical interactions are fundamental to biology. Mechanical forces of chemical origin determine motility and adhesion on the cellular scale, and govern transport and affinity on the molecular scale. Biological sensing in the mechanical domain provides unique opportunities to measure forces, displacements and mass changes from cellular and subcellular processes. Nanomechanical systems are particularly well matched in size with molecular interactions, and provide a basis for biological probes with single-molecule sensitivity. Here we review micro- and nanoscale biosensors, with a particular focus on fast mechanical biosensing in fluid by mass- and force-based methods, and the challenges presented by non-specific interactions. We explain the general issues that will be critical to the success of any type of next-generation mechanical biosensor, such as the need to improve intrinsic device performance, fabrication reproducibility and system integration. We also discuss the need for a greater understanding of analyte&#8211;sensor interactions on the nanoscale and of stochastic processes in the sensing environment.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Nanoscience Institute and Departments of Physics, Applied Physics, and Bioengineering, California Institute of Technology, MC 149-33 Pasadena, 91125, California, USA', 'authors': ['J.L.

letter,Manipulating surface states in topological insulator nanoribbons,"<p>Topological insulators display unique properties, such as the quantum spin Hall effect, because time-reversal symmetry allows charges and spins to propagate along the edge or surface of the topological insulator without scattering. However, the direct manipulation of these edge/surface states is difficult because they are significantly outnumbered by bulk carriers. Here, we report experimental evidence for the modulation of these surface states by using a gate voltage to control quantum oscillations in Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> nanoribbons. Surface conduction can be significantly enhanced by the gate voltage, with the mobility and Fermi velocity reaching values as high as ~5,800&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and ~3.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup>&#160;m&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, respectively, with up to ~51% of the total conductance being due to the surface states. We also report the first observation of h/2e periodic oscillations, suggesting the presence of time-reversed paths with the same relative zero phase at the interference point. The high surface conduction and ability to manipulate the surface states demonstrated here could lead to new applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA', 'authors': ['Faxian Xiu', ',\xa0Liang He', ',\xa0Yong Wang', ',\xa0Li-Te Chang', ',\xa0Murong Lang', ',\xa0Guan Huang', ',\xa0Xufeng Kou', ',\xa0Yi Zhou', ',\xa0Xiaowei Jiang', '\xa0&\xa0Kang L.

letter,Gate-controlled guiding of electrons in graphene,"<p>Ballistic semiconductor structures have allowed the realization of optics-like phenomena in electronic systems, including the magnetic focusing and electrostatic lensing of electrons. An extension that appears unique to graphene is to use both n and p carrier types to create electronic analogues of optical devices with both positive and negative indices of refraction. Here, we use the gate-controlled density of both p and n carrier types in graphene to demonstrate the electronic analogue of fibre-optic guiding. Two basic effects are investigated: bipolar p&#8211;n junction guiding, based on the principle of angle-selective transmission through the interface between the graphene and the p&#8211;n junction; and unipolar fibre-optic guiding, using total internal reflection controlled by carrier density. We also demonstrate modulation of the guiding efficiency through gating, and comparison of these data with numerical simulations indicates that guiding performance is limited by the roughness of the interface. The development of p&#8211;n and fibre-optic guiding in graphene may lead to electrically reconfigurable wiring in high-mobility devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Controlling single-molecule conductance through lateral coupling of π orbitals,"<p>In recent years, various single-molecule electronic components have been demonstrated. However, it remains difficult to predict accurately the conductance of a single molecule and to control the lateral coupling between the &#960; orbitals of the molecule and the orbitals of the electrodes attached to it. This lateral coupling is well known to cause broadening and shifting of the energy levels of the molecule; this, in turn, is expected to greatly modify the conductance of an electrode&#8211;molecule&#8211;electrode junction. Here, we demonstrate a new method, based on lateral coupling, to mechanically and reversibly control the conductance of a single-molecule junction by mechanically modulating the angle between a single pentaphenylene molecule bridged between two metal electrodes. Changing the angle of the molecule from a highly tilted state to an orientation nearly perpendicular to the electrodes changes the conductance by an order of magnitude, which is in qualitative agreement with theoretical models of molecular &#960;-orbital coupling to a metal electrode. The lateral coupling is also directly measured by applying a fast mechanical perturbation in the horizontal plane, thus ruling out changes in the contact geometry or molecular conformation as the source for the conductance change.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, 85287, Arizona, USA', 'authors': ['Ismael Diez-Perez', ',\xa0Joshua Hihath', ',\xa0Thomas Hines', '\xa0&\xa0Nongjian Tao']}, {'address': 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, 08028, Spain', 'authors': ['Ismael Diez-Perez']}, {'address': 'Laboratory of Advanced Materials, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China', 'authors': ['Zhong-Sheng Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Gang Zhou']}, {'address': 'Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research, Ackermannweg 10, Mainz, D-55128, Germany', 'authors': ['Klaus Müllen']}]",False,"['Ismael Diez-Perez', 'Joshua Hihath', 'Thomas Hines', 'Zhong-Sheng Wang', 'Gang Zhou', 'Klaus Müllen', 'Nongjian Tao']","Diez-Perez, I., Hihath, J., Hines, T. et al.

letter,Nanoporous metal/oxide hybrid electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors,"<p>Electrochemical supercapacitors can deliver high levels of electrical power and offer long operating lifetimes, but their energy storage density is too low for many important applications. Pseudocapacitive transition-metal oxides such as MnO<sub>2</sub> could be used to make electrodes in such supercapacitors, because they are predicted to have a high capacitance for storing electrical charge while also being inexpensive and not harmful to the environment. However, the poor conductivity of MnO<sub>2</sub> (10<sup>&#8211;5</sup>&#8211;10<sup>&#8211;6</sup>&#160;S&#160;cm<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) limits the charge/discharge rate for high-power applications. Here, we show that hybrid structures made of nanoporous gold and nanocrystalline MnO<sub>2</sub> have enhanced conductivity, resulting in a specific capacitance of the constituent MnO<sub>2</sub> (&#8764;1,145 F g<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) that is close to the theoretical value. The nanoporous gold allows electron transport through the MnO<sub>2</sub>, and facilitates fast ion diffusion between the MnO<sub>2</sub> and the electrolytes while also acting as a double-layer capacitor. The high specific capacitances and charge/discharge rates offered by such hybrid structures make them promising candidates as electrodes in supercapacitors, combining high-energy storage densities with high levels of power delivery.</p>",,"[{'address': 'WPI Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan', 'authors': ['Xingyou Lang', ',\xa0Akihiko Hirata', ',\xa0Takeshi Fujita', '\xa0&\xa0Mingwei Chen']}]",False,"['Xingyou Lang', 'Akihiko Hirata', 'Takeshi Fujita', 'Mingwei Chen']","Lang, X., Hirata, A., Fujita, T. et al.

letter,A size-dependent nanoscale metal–insulator transition in random materials,"<p>Insulators and conductors with periodic structures can be readily distinguished, because they have different band structures, but the differences between insulators and conductors with random structures are more subtle. In 1958, Anderson provided a straightforward criterion for distinguishing between random insulators and conductors, based on the &#8216;diffusion&#8217; distance &#950; for electrons at 0&#160;K (ref.&#160;). Insulators have a finite &#950;, but conductors have an infinite &#950;. Aided by a scaling argument, this concept can explain many phenomena in disordered electronic systems, such as the fact that the electrical resistivity of &#8216;dirty&#8217; metals always increases as the temperature approaches 0&#160;K (refs&#160;&#8211;). Further verification for this model has come from experiments that measure how the properties of macroscopic samples vary with changes in temperature, pressure, impurity concentration and applied magnetic field, but, surprisingly, there have been no attempts to engineer a metal&#8211;insulator transition by making the sample size less than or more than &#950;. Here, we report such an engineered transition using six different thin-film systems: two are glasses that contain dispersed platinum atoms, and four are single crystals of perovskite that contain minor conducting components. With a sample size comparable to &#950;, transitions can be triggered by using an electric field or ultraviolet radiation to tune &#950; through the injection and extraction of electrons. It would seem possible to take advantage of this nanometallicity in applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science & Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 19104, Pennsylvania, USA', 'authors': ['Albert B.

letter,Atomic-scale magnetometry of distant nuclear spin clusters via nitrogen-vacancy spin in diamond,"<p>The detection of single nuclear spins is an important goal in magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Optically detected magnetic resonance can detect single nuclear spins that are strongly coupled to an electron spin, but the detection of distant nuclear spins that are only weakly coupled to the electron spin has not been considered feasible. Here, using the nitrogen&#8211;vacancy centre in diamond as a model system, we numerically demonstrate that it is possible to detect two or more distant nuclear spins that are weakly coupled to a centre electron spin if these nuclear spins are strongly bonded to each other in a cluster. This cluster will stand out from other nuclear spins by virtue of characteristic oscillations imprinted onto the electron spin decoherence profile, which become pronounced under dynamical decoupling control. Under many-pulse dynamical decoupling, the centre electron spin coherence can be used to measure nuclear magnetic resonances of single molecules. This atomic-scale magnetometry should improve the performance of magnetic resonance spectroscopy for applications in chemical, biological, medical and materials research, and could also have applications in solid-state quantum computing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Center for Quantum Coherence, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China', 'authors': ['Nan Zhao', ',\xa0Jian-Liang Hu', ',\xa0Sai-Wah Ho', ',\xa0Jones T.

article,Transforming C60 molecules into graphene quantum dots,"<p>The fragmentation of fullerenes using ions, surface collisions or thermal effects is a complex process that typically leads to the formation of small carbon clusters of variable size. Here, we show that geometrically well-defined graphene quantum dots can be synthesized on a ruthenium surface using C<sub>60</sub> molecules as a precursor. Scanning tunnelling microscopy imaging, supported by density functional theory calculations, suggests that the structures are formed through the ruthenium-catalysed cage-opening of C<sub>60</sub>. In this process, the strong C<sub>60</sub>&#8211;Ru interaction induces the formation of surface vacancies in the Ru single crystal and a subsequent embedding of C<sub>60</sub> molecules in the surface. The fragmentation of the embedded molecules at elevated temperatures then produces carbon clusters that undergo diffusion and aggregation to form graphene quantum dots. The equilibrium shape of the graphene can be tailored by optimizing the annealing temperature and the density of the carbon clusters.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 3, 117543, Singapore', 'authors': ['Jiong Lu', ',\xa0Pei Shan Emmeline Yeo', '\xa0&\xa0Kian Ping Loh']}, {'address': 'Institute of High Performance Computing, 1 Fusionopolis Way, #16-16 Connexis, 138632, Singapore', 'authors': ['Pei Shan Emmeline Yeo', ',\xa0Chee Kwan Gan', '\xa0&\xa0Ping Wu']}]",False,"['Jiong Lu', 'Pei Shan Emmeline Yeo', 'Chee Kwan Gan', 'Ping Wu', 'Kian Ping Loh']","Lu, J., Yeo, P., Gan, C. et al.

article,Controlling protein translocation through nanopores with bio-inspired fluid walls,"<p>Synthetic nanopores have been used to study individual biomolecules in high throughput, but their performance as sensors does not match that of biological ion channels. Challenges include control of nanopore diameters and surface chemistry, modification of the translocation times of single-molecule analytes through nanopores, and prevention of non-specific interactions with pore walls. Here, inspired by the olfactory sensilla of insect antennae, we show that coating nanopores with a fluid lipid bilayer tailors their surface chemistry and allows fine-tuning and dynamic variation of pore diameters in subnanometre increments. Incorporation of mobile ligands in the lipid bilayer conferred specificity and slowed the translocation of targeted proteins sufficiently to time-resolve translocation events of individual proteins. Lipid coatings also prevented pores from clogging, eliminated non-specific binding and enabled the translocation of amyloid-beta (A&#946;) oligomers and fibrils. Through combined analysis of their translocation time, volume, charge, shape and ligand affinity, different proteins were identified.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, Michigan, USA', 'authors': ['Erik C.
