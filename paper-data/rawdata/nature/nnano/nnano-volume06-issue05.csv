review article,Building plasmonic nanostructures with DNA,"<p>Plasmonic structures can be constructed from precise numbers of well-defined metal nanoparticles that are held together with molecular linkers, templates or spacers. Such structures could be used to concentrate, guide and switch light on the nanoscale in sensors and various other devices. DNA was first used to rationally design plasmonic structures in 1996, and more sophisticated motifs have since emerged as effective and versatile species for guiding the assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles into structures with useful properties. Here we review the design principles for plasmonic nanostructures, and discuss how DNA has been applied to build finite-number assemblies (plasmonic molecules), regularly spaced nanoparticle chains (plasmonic polymers) and extended two- and three-dimensional ordered arrays (plasmonic crystals).</p>",[],False,"[""Shawn J.

letter,Three-dimensional bicontinuous ultrafast-charge and -discharge bulk battery electrodes,"<p>Rapid charge and discharge rates have become an important feature of electrical energy storage devices, but cause dramatic reductions in the energy that can be stored or delivered by most rechargeable batteries (their energy capacity). Supercapacitors do not suffer from this problem, but are restricted to much lower stored energy per mass (energy density) than batteries. A storage technology that combines the rate performance of supercapacitors with the energy density of batteries would significantly advance portable and distributed power technology. Here, we demonstrate very large battery charge and discharge rates with minimal capacity loss by using cathodes made from a self-assembled three-dimensional bicontinuous nanoarchitecture consisting of an electrolytically active material sandwiched between rapid ion and electron transport pathways. Rates of up to 400C and 1,000C for lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride chemistries, respectively, are achieved (where a 1C rate represents a one-hour complete charge or discharge), enabling fabrication of a lithium-ion battery that can be 90% charged in 2 minutes.</p>",[],False,"[""Huigang Zhang"", ""Xindi Yu"", ""Paul V.

letter,Scalable nanostructured membranes for solid-oxide fuel cells,"<p>The use of oxide fuel cells and other solid-state ionic devices in energy applications is limited by their requirement for elevated operating temperatures, typically above 800&#160;&#176;C (ref.&#160;). Thin-film membranes allow low-temperature operation by reducing the ohmic resistance of the electrolytes. However, although proof-of-concept thin-film devices have been demonstrated, scaling up remains a significant challenge because large-area membranes less than &#8764;100 nm thick are susceptible to mechanical failure. Here, we report that nanoscale yttria-stabilized zirconia membranes with lateral dimensions on the scale of millimetres or centimetres can be made thermomechanically stable by depositing metallic grids on them to function as mechanical supports. We combine such a membrane with a nanostructured dense oxide cathode to make a thin-film solid-oxide fuel cell that can achieve a power density of 155 mW cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup> at 510&#160;&#176;C. We also report a total power output of more than 20&#160;mW from a single fuel-cell chip.

letter,"Nanoscale Joule heating, Peltier cooling and current crowding at graphene–metal contacts","<p>The performance and scaling of graphene-based electronics is limited by the quality of contacts between the graphene and metal electrodes. However, the nature of graphene&#8211;metal contacts remains incompletely understood. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to measure the temperature distributions at the contacts of working graphene transistors with a spatial resolution of &#8764;10 nm (refs), allowing us to identify the presence of Joule heating, current crowding and thermoelectric heating and cooling. Comparison with simulation enables extraction of the contact resistivity (150&#8211;200&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m<sup>2</sup>) and transfer length (0.2&#8211;0.5&#160;&#181;m) in our devices; these generally limit performance and must be minimized. Our data indicate that thermoelectric effects account for up to one-third of the contact temperature changes, and that current crowding accounts for most of the remainder. Modelling predicts that the role of current crowding will diminish and the role of thermoelectric effects will increase as contacts improve.</p>",[],False,"[""Kyle L.

letter,Nanoparticles reduce nickel allergy by capturing metal ions,"<p>Approximately 10% of the population in the USA suffer from nickel allergy, and many are unable to wear jewellery or handle coins and other objects that contain nickel. Many agents have been developed to reduce the penetration of nickel through skin, but few formulations are safe and effective. Here, we show that applying a thin layer of glycerine emollient containing nanoparticles of either calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate on an isolated piece of pig skin (in vitro) and on the skin of mice (in vivo) prevents the penetration of nickel ions into the skin. The nanoparticles capture nickel ions by cation exchange, and remain on the surface of the skin, allowing them to be removed by simple washing with water. Approximately 11-fold fewer nanoparticles by mass are required to achieve the same efficacy as the chelating agent ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. Using nanoparticles with diameters smaller than 500&#160;nm in topical creams may be an effective way to limit the exposure to metal ions that can cause skin irritation.</p>",[],False,"[""Praveen Kumar Vemula"", ""R.

article,A stretchable carbon nanotube strain sensor for human-motion detection,"<p>Devices made from stretchable electronic materials could be incorporated into clothing or attached directly to the body. Such materials have typically been prepared by engineering conventional rigid materials such as silicon, rather than by developing new materials. Here, we report a class of wearable and stretchable devices fabricated from thin films of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes. When stretched, the nanotube films fracture into gaps and islands, and bundles bridging the gaps. This mechanism allows the films to act as strain sensors capable of measuring strains up to 280% (50 times more than conventional metal strain gauges), with high durability, fast response and low creep. We assembled the carbon-nanotube sensors on stockings, bandages and gloves to fabricate devices that can detect different types of human motion, including movement, typing, breathing and speech.</p>",[],False,"[""Takeo Yamada"", ""Yuhei Hayamizu"", ""Yuki Yamamoto"", ""Yoshiki Yomogida"", ""Ali Izadi-Najafabadi"", ""Don N.

article,Hydrogen production from formic acid decomposition at room temperature using a Ag–Pd core–shell nanocatalyst,"<p>Formic acid (HCOOH) has great potential as an in situ source of hydrogen for fuel cells, because it offers high energy density, is non-toxic and can be safely handled in aqueous solution. So far, there has been a lack of solid catalysts that are sufficiently active and/or selective for hydrogen production from formic acid at room temperature. Here, we report that Ag nanoparticles coated with a thin layer of Pd atoms can significantly enhance the production of H<sub>2</sub> from formic acid at ambient temperature. Atom probe tomography confirmed that the nanoparticles have a core&#8211;shell configuration, with the shell containing between 1 and 10 layers of Pd atoms. The Pd shell contains terrace sites and is electronically promoted by the Ag core, leading to significantly enhanced catalytic properties. Our nanocatalysts could be used in the development of micro polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells for portable devices and could also be applied in the promotion of other catalytic reactions under mild conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Karaked Tedsree"", ""Tong Li"", ""Simon Jones"", ""Chun Wong Aaron Chan"", ""Kai Man Kerry Yu"", ""Paul A.

Label-free kinetic assays based on surface plasmon resonance are the current gold standard, but they have poor detection limits, suffer from non-specific binding, and are not amenable to high-throughput analyses. Here, we show that magnetically responsive nanosensors that have been scaled to over 100,000&#160;sensors per cm<sup>2</sup> can be used to measure the binding kinetics of various proteins with high spatial and temporal resolution. We present an analytical model that describes the binding of magnetically labelled antibodies to proteins that are immobilized on the sensor surface.

article,Silica and titanium dioxide nanoparticles cause pregnancy complications in mice,"<p>The increasing use of nanomaterials has raised concerns about their potential risks to human health. Recent studies have shown that nanoparticles can cross the placenta barrier in pregnant mice and cause neurotoxicity in their offspring, but a more detailed understanding of the effects of nanoparticles on pregnant animals remains elusive. Here, we show that silica and titanium dioxide nanoparticles with diameters of 70&#160;nm and 35&#160;nm, respectively, can cause pregnancy complications when injected intravenously into pregnant mice. The silica and titanium dioxide nanoparticles were found in the placenta, fetal liver and fetal brain. Mice treated with these nanoparticles had smaller uteri and smaller fetuses than untreated controls. Fullerene molecules and larger (300 and 1,000&#160;nm) silica particles did not induce these complications. These detrimental effects are linked to structural and functional abnormalities in the placenta on the maternal side, and are abolished when the surfaces of the silica nanoparticles are modified with carboxyl and amine groups.</p>",[],False,"[""Kohei Yamashita"", ""Yasuo Yoshioka"", ""Kazuma Higashisaka"", ""Kazuya Mimura"", ""Yuki Morishita"", ""Masatoshi Nozaki"", ""Tokuyuki Yoshida"", ""Toshinobu Ogura"", ""Hiromi Nabeshi"", ""Kazuya Nagano"", ""Yasuhiro Abe"", ""Haruhiko Kamada"", ""Youko Monobe"", ""Takayoshi Imazawa"", ""Hisae Aoshima"", ""Kiyoshi Shishido"", ""Yuichi Kawai"", ""Tadanori Mayumi"", ""Shin-ichi Tsunoda"", ""Norio Itoh"", ""Tomoaki Yoshikawa"", ""Itaru Yanagihara"", ""Shigeru Saito"", ""Yasuo Tsutsumi""]","Yamashita, K., Yoshioka, Y., Higashisaka, K. et al.
