letter,Nonlinear damping in mechanical resonators made from carbon nanotubes and graphene,"<p>The theory of damping is discussed in Newton's Principia and has been tested in objects as diverse as the Foucault pendulum, the mirrors in gravitational-wave detectors and submicrometre mechanical resonators. In general, the damping observed in these systems can be described by a linear damping force. Advances in nanofabrication mean that it is now possible to explore damping in systems with one or more atomic-scale dimensions. Here we study the damping of mechanical resonators based on carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets. The damping is found to strongly depend on the amplitude of motion, and can be described by a nonlinear rather than a linear damping force. We exploit the nonlinear nature of damping in these systems to improve the figures of merit for both nanotube and graphene resonators. For instance, we achieve a quality factor of 100,000 for a graphene resonator.</p>",,"[{'address': 'CIN2 (ICN-CSIC), Catalan Institute of Nanotechnology, Campus de la UAB 08193 Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['A.

Such devices have been realized in a variety of materials and exhibit remarkable electronic, optical and spintronic properties. Here, we use an atomic force microscope tip to reversibly &#8216;sketch&#8217; single-electron transistors by controlling a metal&#8211;insulator transition at the interface of two oxides. In these devices, single electrons tunnel resonantly between source and drain electrodes through a conducting oxide island with a diameter of &#8764;1.5 nm. We demonstrate control over the number of electrons on the island using bottom- and side-gate electrodes, and observe hysteresis in electron occupation that is attributed to ferroelectricity within the oxide heterostructure.

letter,"Band-like transport, high electron mobility and high photoconductivity in all-inorganic nanocrystal arrays","<p>Flexible, thin-film electronic and optoelectronic devices typically involve a trade-off between performance and fabrication cost. For example, solution-based deposition allows semiconductors to be patterned onto large-area substrates to make solar cells and displays, but the electron mobility in solution-deposited semiconductor layers is much lower than in semiconductors grown at high temperatures from the gas phase. Here, we report band-like electron transport in arrays of colloidal cadmium selenide nanocrystals capped with the molecular metal chalcogenide complex In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#8722;</sup>, and measure electron mobilities as high as 16&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is about an order of magnitude higher than in the best solution-processed organic and nanocrystal devices so far.

letter,In situ formation of highly conducting covalent Au–C contacts for single-molecule junctions,"<p>Charge transport across metal&#8211;molecule interfaces has an important role in organic electronics. Typically, chemical link groups such as thiols or amines are used to bind organic molecules to metal electrodes in single-molecule circuits, with these groups controlling both the physical structure and the electronic coupling at the interface. Direct metal&#8211;carbon coupling has been shown through C60, benzene and &#960;-stacked benzene, but ideally the carbon backbone of the molecule should be covalently bonded to the electrode without intervening link groups. Here, we demonstrate a method to create junctions with such contacts. Trimethyl tin (SnMe<sub>3</sub>)-terminated polymethylene chains are used to form single-molecule junctions with a break-junction technique. Gold atoms at the electrode displace the SnMe<sub>3</sub> linkers, leading to the formation of direct Au&#8211;C bonded single-molecule junctions with a conductance that is &#8764;100 times larger than analogous alkanes with most other terminations. The conductance of these Au&#8211;C bonded alkanes decreases exponentially with molecular length, with a decay constant of 0.97 per methylene, consistent with a non-resonant transport mechanism. Control experiments and ab initio calculations show that high conductances are achieved because a covalent Au&#8211;C sigma (&#963;) bond is formed. This offers a new method for making reproducible and highly conducting metal&#8211;organic contacts.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, 3000 Broadway, New York, New York 10027, USA', 'authors': ['Z.-L.

letter,Quantum measurement and orientation tracking of fluorescent nanodiamonds inside living cells,"<p>Fluorescent particles are routinely used to probe biological processes. The quantum properties of single spins within fluorescent particles have been explored in the field of nanoscale magnetometry, but not yet in biological environments. Here, we demonstrate optically detected magnetic resonance of individual fluorescent nanodiamond nitrogen-vacancy centres inside living human HeLa cells, and measure their location, orientation, spin levels and spin coherence times with nanoscale precision. Quantum coherence was measured through Rabi and spin-echo sequences over long (&gt;10&#160;h) periods, and orientation was tracked with effective 1&#176; angular precision over acquisition times of 89&#160;ms. The quantum spin levels served as fingerprints, allowing individual centres with identical fluorescence to be identified and tracked simultaneously. Furthermore, monitoring decoherence rates in response to changes in the local environment may provide new information about intracellular processes.

article,Controlling electrical percolation in multicomponent carbon nanotube dispersions,"<p>Carbon nanotube reinforced polymeric composites can have favourable electrical properties, which make them useful for applications such as flat-panel displays and photovoltaic devices. However, using aqueous dispersions to fabricate composites with specific physical properties requires that the processing of the nanotube dispersion be understood and controlled while in the liquid phase. Here, using a combination of experiment and theory, we study the electrical percolation of carbon nanotubes introduced into a polymer matrix, and show that the percolation threshold can be substantially lowered by adding small quantities of a conductive polymer latex. Mixing colloidal particles of different sizes and shapes (in this case, spherical latex particles and rod-like nanotubes) introduces competing length scales that can strongly influence the formation of the system-spanning networks that are needed to produce electrically conductive composites. Interplay between the different species in the dispersions leads to synergetic or antagonistic percolation, depending on the ease of charge transport between the various conductive components.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Group Theory of Polymers and Soft Matter, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, PO Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Andriy V.

article,The effect of sedimentation and diffusion on cellular uptake of gold nanoparticles,"<p>In vitro experiments typically measure the uptake of nanoparticles by exposing cells at the bottom of a culture plate to a suspension of nanoparticles, and it is generally assumed that this suspension is well-dispersed. However, nanoparticles can sediment, which means that the concentration of nanoparticles on the cell surface may be higher than the initial bulk concentration, and this could lead to increased uptake by cells. Here, we use upright and inverted cell culture configurations to show that cellular uptake of gold nanoparticles depends on the sedimentation and diffusion velocities of the nanoparticles and is independent of size, shape, density, surface coating and initial concentration of the nanoparticles. Generally, more nanoparticles are taken up in the upright configuration than in the inverted one, and nanoparticles with faster sedimentation rates showed greater differences in uptake between the two configurations. Our results suggest that sedimentation needs to be considered when performing in vitro studies for large and/or heavy nanoparticles.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, 63130, Missouri, USA', 'authors': ['Eun Chul Cho', ',\xa0Qiang Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Younan Xia']}]",False,"['Eun Chul Cho', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Younan Xia']","Cho, E., Zhang, Q. & Xia, Y.
