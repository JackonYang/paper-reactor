letter,Large-area flexible 3D optical negative index metamaterial formed by nanotransfer printing,"<p>Negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) are engineered structures with optical properties that cannot be obtained in naturally occurring materials. Recent work has demonstrated that focused ion beam and layer-by-layer electron-beam lithography can be used to pattern the necessary nanoscale features over small areas (hundreds of &#181;m<sup>2</sup>) for metamaterials with three-dimensional layouts and interesting characteristics, including negative-index behaviour in the optical regime. A key challenge is in the fabrication of such three-dimensional NIMs with sizes and at throughputs necessary for many realistic applications (including lenses, resonators and other photonic components). We report a simple printing approach capable of forming large-area, high-quality NIMs with three-dimensional, multilayer formats. Here, a silicon wafer with deep, nanoscale patterns of surface relief serves as a reusable stamp. Blanket deposition of alternating layers of silver and magnesium fluoride onto such a stamp represents a process for &#8216;inking&#8217; it with thick, multilayer assemblies. Transfer printing this ink material onto rigid or flexible substrates completes the fabrication in a high-throughput manner. Experimental measurements and simulation results show that macroscale, three-dimensional NIMs (&gt;75&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>) nano-manufactured in this way exhibit a strong, negative index of refraction in the near-infrared spectral range, with excellent figures of merit.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Departments of Materials Science and Engineering, Beckman Institute, and Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Debashis Chanda', ',\xa0Kazuki Shigeta', ',\xa0Sidhartha Gupta', ',\xa0Tyler Cain', ',\xa0Andrew Carlson', ',\xa0Agustin Mihi', ',\xa0Paul Braun', '\xa0&\xa0John A.

letter,Discovery of superconductivity in KTaO3 by electrostatic carrier doping,"<p>Superconductivity at interfaces has been investigated since the first demonstration of electric-field-tunable superconductivity in ultrathin films in 1960<sup>1</sup>. So far, research on interface superconductivity has focused on materials that are known to be superconductors in bulk. Here, we show that electrostatic carrier doping can induce superconductivity in KTaO<sub>3</sub>, a material in which superconductivity has not been observed before. Taking advantage of the large capacitance of the self-organized electric double layer that forms at the interface between an ionic liquid and KTaO<sub>3</sub> (ref.&#160;), we achieve a charge carrier density that is an order of magnitude larger than the density that can be achieved with conventional chemical doping. Superconductivity emerges in KTaO<sub>3</sub> at 50&#160;mK for two-dimensional carrier densities in the range 2.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>14</sup> to 3.7&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>14</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>.

letter,Spin–orbit-driven ferromagnetic resonance,"<p>Ferromagnetic resonance is the most widely used technique for characterizing ferromagnetic materials. However, its use is generally restricted to wafer-scale samples or specific micro-magnetic devices, such as spin valves, which have a spatially varying magnetization profile and where ferromagnetic resonance can be induced by an alternating current owing to angular momentum transfer. Here we introduce a form of ferromagnetic resonance in which an electric current oscillating at microwave frequencies is used to create an effective magnetic field in the magnetic material being probed, which makes it possible to characterize individual nanoscale samples with uniform magnetization profiles. The technique takes advantage of the microscopic non-collinearity of individual electron spins arising from spin&#8211;orbit coupling and bulk or structural inversion asymmetry in the band structure of the sample. We characterize lithographically patterned (Ga,Mn)As and (Ga,Mn)(As,P) nanoscale bars, including broadband measurements of resonant damping as a function of frequency, and measurements of anisotropy as a function of bar width and strain. In addition, vector magnetometry on the driving fields reveals contributions with the symmetry of both the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin&#8211;orbit interactions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Microelectronics Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, JJ Thomson Avenue, Cambridge, CB3 0HE, UK', 'authors': ['D.

letter,Exchange-coupled magnetic nanoparticles for efficient heat induction,"<p>The conversion of electromagnetic energy into heat by nanoparticles has the potential to be a powerful, non-invasive technique for biotechnology applications such as drug release, disease treatment and remote control of single cell functions, but poor conversion efficiencies have hindered practical applications so far. In this Letter, we demonstrate a significant increase in the efficiency of magnetic thermal induction by nanoparticles. We take advantage of the exchange coupling between a magnetically hard core and magnetically soft shell to tune the magnetic properties of the nanoparticle and maximize the specific loss power, which is a gauge of the conversion efficiency. The optimized core&#8211;shell magnetic nanoparticles have specific loss power values that are an order of magnitude larger than conventional iron-oxide nanoparticles. We also perform an antitumour study in mice, and find that the therapeutic efficacy of these nanoparticles is superior to that of a common anticancer drug.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Korea', 'authors': ['Jae-Hyun Lee', ',\xa0Jung-tak Jang', ',\xa0Jin-sil Choi', ',\xa0Seung Ho Moon', ',\xa0Seung-hyun Noh', ',\xa0Ji-wook Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Jinwoo Cheon']}, {'address': 'Division of Electron Microscopic Research, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon, 305-333, Korea', 'authors': ['Jin-Gyu Kim']}, {'address': 'Department of Pediatrics and BK 21, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 120-752, Korea', 'authors': ['Il-Sun Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Kook In Park']}]",False,"['Jae-Hyun Lee', 'Jung-tak Jang', 'Jin-sil Choi', 'Seung Ho Moon', 'Seung-hyun Noh', 'Ji-wook Kim', 'Jin-Gyu Kim', 'Il-Sun Kim', 'Kook In Park', 'Jinwoo Cheon']","Lee, J., Jang, J., Choi, J. et al.

letter,Tunable subradiant lattice plasmons by out-of-plane dipolar interactions,"<p>Plasmonic nanostructures concentrate optical fields into nanoscale volumes, which is useful for plasmonic nanolasers, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and white-light generation. However, the short lifetimes of the emissive plasmons correspond to a rapid depletion of the plasmon energy, preventing further enhancement of local optical fields. Dark (subradiant) plasmons have longer lifetimes, but their resonant wavelengths cannot be tuned over a broad wavelength range without changing the overall geometry of the nanostructures. Also, fabrication of the nanostructures cannot be readily scaled because their complex shapes have subwavelength dimensions. Here, we report a new type of subradiant plasmon with a narrow (&#8764;5 nm) resonant linewidth that can be easily tuned by changing the height of large (&gt;100 nm) gold nanoparticles arranged in a two-dimensional array. At resonance, strong coupling between out-of-plane nanoparticle dipolar moments suppresses radiative decay, trapping light in the plane of the array and strongly localizing optical fields on each nanoparticle. This new mechanism can open up applications for subradiant plasmons because height-controlled nanoparticle arrays can be manufactured over wafer-scale areas on a variety of substrates.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Northwestern University, 2220 Campus Drive, Evanston, 60208, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Wei Zhou', '\xa0&\xa0Teri W.

letter,Detecting single viruses and nanoparticles using whispering gallery microlasers,"<p>There is a strong demand for portable systems that can detect and characterize individual pathogens and other nanoscale objects without the use of labels, for applications in human health, homeland security, environmental monitoring and diagnostics. However, most nanoscale objects of interest have low polarizabilities due to their small size and low refractive index contrast with the surrounding medium. This leads to weak light&#8211;matter interactions, and thus makes the label-free detection of single nanoparticles very difficult. Micro- and nano-photonic devices have emerged as highly sensitive platforms for such applications, because the combination of high quality factor Q and small mode volume V leads to significantly enhanced light&#8211;matter interactions. For example, whispering gallery mode microresonators have been used to detect and characterize single influenza virions and polystyrene nanoparticles with a radius of 30&#160;nm (ref.&#160;) by measuring in the transmission spectrum either the resonance shift or mode splitting induced by the nanoscale objects. Increasing Q leads to a narrower resonance linewidth, which makes it possible to resolve smaller changes in the transmission spectrum, and thus leads to improved performance. Here, we report a whispering gallery mode microlaser-based real-time and label-free detection method that can detect individual 15-nm-radius polystyrene nanoparticles, 10-nm gold nanoparticles and influenza A virions in air, and 30&#160;nm polystyrene nanoparticles in water. Our approach relies on measuring changes in the beat note that is produced when an ultra-narrow emission line from a whispering gallery mode microlaser is split into two modes by a nanoscale object, and these two modes then interfere. The ultimate detection limit is set by the laser linewidth, which can be made much narrower than the resonance linewidth of any passive resonator. This means that microlaser sensors have the potential to detect objects that are too small to be detected by passive resonator sensors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, 63130, USA', 'authors': ['Lina He', ',\xa0Şahin Kaya Özdemir', ',\xa0Jiangang Zhu', ',\xa0Woosung Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Lan Yang']}]",False,"['Lina He', 'Şahin Kaya Özdemir', 'Jiangang Zhu', 'Woosung Kim', 'Lan Yang']","He, L., Özdemir, Ş., Zhu, J. et al.

letter,Single-molecule transport across an individual biomimetic nuclear pore complex,"<p>Nuclear pore complexes regulate the selective exchange of RNA and proteins across the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. Biomimetic strategies offer new opportunities to investigate this remarkable transport phenomenon. Here, we show selective transport of proteins across individual biomimetic nuclear pore complexes at the single-molecule level. Each biomimetic complex is constructed by covalently tethering either Nup98 or Nup153 (phenylalanine-glycine (FG) nucleoporins) to a solid-state nanopore. Individual translocation events are monitored using ionic current measurements with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Transport receptors (Imp&#946;) proceed with a dwell time of &#8764;2.5 ms for both Nup98- and Nup153-coated pores, whereas the passage of non-specific proteins is strongly inhibited with different degrees of selectivity. For pores up to &#8764;25 nm in diameter, Nups form a dense and low-conducting barrier, whereas they adopt a more open structure in larger pores.

article,Bi- and trilayer graphene solutions,"<p>Bilayer and trilayer graphene with controlled stacking is emerging as one of the most promising candidates for post-silicon nanoelectronics. However, it is not yet possible to produce large quantities of bilayer or trilayer graphene with controlled stacking, as is required for many applications. Here, we demonstrate a solution-phase technique for the production of large-area, bilayer or trilayer graphene from graphite, with controlled stacking. The ionic compounds iodine chloride (ICl) or iodine bromide (IBr) intercalate the graphite starting material at every second or third layer, creating second- or third-stage controlled graphite intercolation compounds, respectively. The resulting solution dispersions are specifically enriched with bilayer or trilayer graphene, respectively. Because the process requires only mild sonication, it produces graphene flakes with areas as large as 50&#160;&#181;m<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, the electronic properties of the flakes are superior to those achieved with other solution-based methods; for example, unannealed samples have resistivities as low as &#8764;1 k&#937; and hole mobilities as high as &#8764;400 cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8211;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup>.

article,Highly uniform and reproducible surface-enhanced Raman scattering from DNA-tailorable nanoparticles with 1-nm interior gap,"<p>An ideal surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanostructure for sensing and imaging applications should induce a high signal enhancement, generate a reproducible and uniform response, and should be easy to synthesize. Many SERS-active nanostructures have been investigated, but they suffer from poor reproducibility of the SERS-active sites, and the wide distribution of their enhancement factor values results in an unquantifiable SERS signal. Here, we show that DNA on gold nanoparticles facilitates the formation of well-defined gold nanobridged nanogap particles (Au-NNP) that generate a highly stable and reproducible SERS signal. The uniform and hollow gap (&#8764;1 nm) between the gold core and gold shell can be precisely loaded with a quantifiable amount of Raman dyes. SERS signals generated by Au-NNPs showed a linear dependence on probe concentration (R<sup>2</sup>&#160;&gt;&#160;0.98) and were sensitive down to 10&#160;fM concentrations. Single-particle nano-Raman mapping analysis revealed that &gt;90% of Au-NNPs had enhancement factors greater than 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>8</sup>, which is sufficient for single-molecule detection, and the values were narrowly distributed between 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>8</sup> and 5.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>9</sup>.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-747, South Korea', 'authors': ['Dong-Kwon Lim', ',\xa0Jae-Ho Hwang', '\xa0&\xa0Jwa-Min Nam']}, {'address': 'Laboratory for Advanced Molecular Probing (LAMP), NanoBio Fusion Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, DaeJeon, 305-600, South Korea', 'authors': ['Ki-Seok Jeon', '\xa0&\xa0Yung Doug Suh']}, {'address': 'School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science', 'authors': ['Hyoki Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Sunghoon Kwon']}, {'address': 'Inter-University Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC), Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-744, South Korea', 'authors': ['Sunghoon Kwon']}]",False,"['Dong-Kwon Lim', 'Ki-Seok Jeon', 'Jae-Ho Hwang', 'Hyoki Kim', 'Sunghoon Kwon', 'Yung Doug Suh', 'Jwa-Min Nam']","Lim, D., Jeon, K., Hwang, J. et al.
