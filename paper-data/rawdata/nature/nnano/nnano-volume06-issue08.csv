letter,Deconfinement leads to changes in the nanoscale plasticity of silicon,"<p>Silicon crystals have an important role in the electronics industry, and silicon nanoparticles have applications in areas such as nanoelectromechanical systems, photonics and biotechnology. However, the elastic&#8211;plastic transition observed in silicon is not fully understood; in particular, it is not known if the plasticity of silicon is determined by dislocations or by transformations between phases. Here, based on compression experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the mechanical properties of bulk silicon and silicon nanoparticles are significantly different. We find that bulk silicon exists in a state of relative constraint, with its plasticity dominated by phase transformations, whereas silicon nanoparticles are less constrained and display dislocation-driven plasticity. This transition, which we call deconfinement, can also explain the absence of phase transformations in deformed silicon nanowedges. Furthermore, the phenomenon is in agreement with effects observed in shape-memory alloy nanopillars, and provides insight into the origin of incipient plasticity.</p>",[],False,"[""Dariusz Chrobak"", ""Natalia Tymiak"", ""Aaron Beaber"", ""Ozan Ugurlu"", ""William W.

letter,"DNA-based programming of quantum dot valency, self-assembly and luminescence","<p>The electronic and optical properties of colloidal quantum dots, including the wavelengths of light that they can absorb and emit, depend on the size of the quantum dots. These properties have been exploited in a number of applications including optical detection, solar energy harvesting and biological research. Here, we report the self-assembly of quantum dot complexes using cadmium telluride nanocrystals capped with specific sequences of DNA. Quantum dots with between one and five DNA-based binding sites are synthesized and then used as building blocks to create a variety of rationally designed assemblies, including cross-shaped complexes containing three different types of dots. The structure of the complexes is confirmed with transmission electron microscopy, and photophysical studies are used to quantify energy transfer among the constituent components. Through changes in pH, the conformation of the complexes can also be reversibly switched, turning on and off the transfer of energy between the constituent quantum dots.</p>",[],False,"[""Grigory Tikhomirov"", ""Sjoerd Hoogland"", ""P.

letter,Thick lead-free ferroelectric films with high Curie temperatures through nanocomposite-induced strain,"<p>Ferroelectric materials are used in applications ranging from energy harvesting to high-power electronic transducers. However, industry-standard ferroelectric materials contain lead, which is toxic and environmentally unfriendly. The preferred alternative, BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, is non-toxic and has excellent ferroelectric properties, but its Curie temperature of &#8764;130 &#176;C is too low to be practical. Strain has been used to enhance the Curie temperature of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> (ref.&#160;) and SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (ref.&#160;) films, but only for thicknesses of tens of nanometres, which is not thick enough for many device applications. Here, we increase the Curie temperature of micrometre-thick films of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> to at least 330&#160;&#176;C, and the tetragonal-to-cubic structural transition temperature to beyond 800&#160;&#176;C, by interspersing stiff, self-assembled vertical columns of Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> throughout the film thickness. The columns, which are 10&#160;nm in diameter, strain the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> matrix by 2.35%, forcing it to maintain its tetragonal structure and resulting in the highest BaTiO<sub>3</sub> transition temperatures so far.</p>",[],False,"[""Sophie A.

letter,Direct laser writing of micro-supercapacitors on hydrated graphite oxide films,"<p>Microscale supercapacitors provide an important complement to batteries in a variety of applications, including portable electronics. Although they can be manufactured using a number of printing and lithography techniques, continued improvements in cost, scalability and form factor are required to realize their full potential. Here, we demonstrate the scalable fabrication of a new type of all-carbon, monolithic supercapacitor by laser reduction and patterning of graphite oxide films. We pattern both in-plane and conventional electrodes consisting of reduced graphite oxide with micrometre resolution, between which graphite oxide serves as a solid electrolyte. The substantial amounts of trapped water in the graphite oxide makes it simultaneously a good ionic conductor and an electrical insulator, allowing it to serve as both an electrolyte and an electrode separator with ion transport characteristics similar to that observed for Nafion membranes. The resulting micro-supercapacitor devices show good cyclic stability, and energy storage capacities comparable to existing thin-film supercapacitors.</p>",[],False,"[""Wei Gao"", ""Neelam Singh"", ""Li Song"", ""Zheng Liu"", ""Arava Leela Mohana Reddy"", ""Lijie Ci"", ""Robert Vajtai"", ""Qing Zhang"", ""Bingqing Wei"", ""Pulickel M.

letter,Interfacial phase-change memory,"<p>Phase-change memory technology relies on the electrical and optical properties of certain materials changing substantially when the atomic structure of the material is altered by heating or some other excitation process. For example, switching the composite Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub> (GST) alloy from its covalently bonded amorphous phase to its resonantly bonded metastable cubic crystalline phase decreases the resistivity by three orders of magnitude, and also increases reflectivity across the visible spectrum. Moreover, phase-change memory based on GST is scalable, and is therefore a candidate to replace Flash memory for non-volatile data storage applications. The energy needed to switch between the two phases depends on the intrinsic properties of the phase-change material and the device architecture; this energy is usually supplied by laser or electrical pulses. The switching energy for GST can be reduced by limiting the movement of the atoms to a single dimension, thus substantially reducing the entropic losses associated with the phase-change process. In particular, aligning the c-axis of a hexagonal Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> layer and the &#12296;111&#12297; direction of a cubic GeTe layer in a superlattice structure creates a material in which Ge atoms can switch between octahedral sites and lower-coordination sites at the interface of the superlattice layers. Here we demonstrate GeTe/Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> interfacial phase-change memory (IPCM) data storage devices with reduced switching energies, improved write-erase cycle lifetimes and faster switching speeds.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

letter,Electrically pumped waveguide lasing from ZnO nanowires,"<p>Ultraviolet semiconductor lasers are widely used for applications in photonics, information storage, biology and medical therapeutics. Although the performance of gallium nitride ultraviolet lasers has improved significantly over the past decade, demand for lower costs, higher powers and shorter wavelengths has motivated interest in zinc oxide (ZnO), which has a wide direct bandgap and a large exciton binding energy. ZnO-based random lasing has been demonstrated with both optical and electrical pumping, but random lasers suffer from reduced output powers, unstable emission spectra and beam divergence. Here, we demonstrate electrically pumped Fabry&#8211;Perot type waveguide lasing from laser diodes that consist of Sb-doped p-type ZnO nanowires and n-type ZnO thin films. The diodes exhibit highly stable lasing at room temperature, and can be modelled with finite-difference time-domain methods.</p>",[],False,"[""Sheng Chu"", ""Guoping Wang"", ""Weihang Zhou"", ""Yuqing Lin"", ""Leonid Chernyak"", ""Jianze Zhao"", ""Jieying Kong"", ""Lin Li"", ""Jingjian Ren"", ""Jianlin Liu""]","Chu, S., Wang, G., Zhou, W. et al.

article,Electrically tuned spin–orbit interaction in an InAs self-assembled quantum dot,"<p>Electrical control over electron spin is a prerequisite for spintronics spin-based quantum information processing. In particular, control over the interaction between the orbital motion and the spin state of electrons would be valuable, because this interaction influences spin relaxation and dephasing. Electric fields have been used to tune the strength of the spin&#8211;orbit interaction in two-dimensional electron gases, but not, so far, in quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate that electrical gating can be used to vary the energy of the spin&#8211;orbit interaction in the range 50&#8211;150&#160;&#181;eV while maintaining the electron occupation of a single self-assembled InAs quantum dot.

article,Long-range electron tunnelling in oligo-porphyrin molecular wires,"<p>Short chains of porphyrin molecules can mediate electron transport over distances as long as 5&#8211;10&#160;nm with low attenuation. This means that porphyrin-based molecular wires could be useful in nanoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, but the mechanisms responsible for charge transport in single oligo-porphyrin wires have not yet been established. Here, based on electrical measurements of single-molecule junctions, we show that the conductance of the oligo-porphyrin wires has a strong dependence on temperature, and a weak dependence on the length of the wire. Although it is widely accepted that such behaviour is a signature of a thermally assisted incoherent (hopping) mechanism, density functional theory calculations and an accompanying analytical model strongly suggest that the observed temperature and length dependence is consistent with phase-coherent tunnelling through the whole molecular junction.</p>",[],False,"[""Gita Sedghi"", ""V\u00edctor M.

article,Cell-surface sensors for real-time probing of cellular environments,"<p>The ability to explore cell signalling and cell-to-cell communication is essential for understanding cell biology and developing effective therapeutics. However, it is not yet possible to monitor the interaction of cells with their environments in real time. Here, we show that a fluorescent sensor attached to a cell membrane can detect signalling molecules in the cellular environment. The sensor is an aptamer (a short length of single-stranded DNA) that binds to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and contains a pair of fluorescent dyes. When bound to PDGF, the aptamer changes conformation and the dyes come closer to each other, producing a signal. The sensor, which is covalently attached to the membranes of mesenchymal stem cells, can quantitatively detect with high spatial and temporal resolution PDGF that is added in cell culture medium or secreted by neighbouring cells. The engineered stem cells retain their ability to find their way to the bone marrow and can be monitored in vivo at the single-cell level using intravital microscopy.</p>",[],False,"[""Weian Zhao"", ""Sebastian Schafer"", ""Jonghoon Choi"", ""Yvonne J.
