letter,Ultrastrong adhesion of graphene membranes,"<p>As mechanical structures enter the nanoscale regime, the influence of van der Waals forces increases. Graphene is attractive for nanomechanical systems because its Young's modulus and strength are both intrinsically high, but the mechanical behaviour of graphene is also strongly influenced by the van der Waals force. For example, this force clamps graphene samples to substrates, and also holds together the individual graphene sheets in multilayer samples. Here we use a pressurized blister test to directly measure the adhesion energy of graphene sheets with a silicon oxide substrate. We find an adhesion energy of 0.45&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02&#160;J&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> for monolayer graphene and 0.31&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;J&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> for samples containing two to five graphene sheets. These values are larger than the adhesion energies measured in typical micromechanical structures and are comparable to solid&#8211;liquid adhesion energies. We attribute this to the extreme flexibility of graphene, which allows it to conform to the topography of even the smoothest substrates, thus making its interaction with the substrate more liquid-like than solid-like.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, 80309, Colorado, USA', 'authors': ['Steven P.

letter,Light–induced disassembly of self-assembled vesicle-capped nanotubes observed in real time,"<p>Molecular self-assembly is the basis for the formation of numerous artificial nanostructures. The self-organization of peptides, amphiphilic molecules composed of fused benzene rings and other functional molecules into nanotubes is of particular interest. However, the design of dynamic, complex self-organized systems that are responsive to external stimuli remains a significant challenge. Here, we report self-assembled, vesicle-capped nanotubes that can be selectively disassembled by irradiation. The walls of the nanotubes are 3-nm-thick bilayers and are made from amphiphilic molecules with two hydrophobic legs that interdigitate when the molecules self-assemble into bilayers. In the presence of phospholipids, a phase separation between the phospholipids and the amphiphilic molecules creates nanotubes, which are end-capped by vesicles that can be chemically altered or removed and reattached without affecting the nanotubes. The presence of a photoswitchable and fluorescent core in the amphiphilic molecules allows fast and highly controlled disassembly of the nanotubes on irradiation, and distinct disassembly processes can be observed in real time using fluorescence microscopy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Systems Chemistry, Stratingh Institute for Chemistry, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 4, Groningen, 9747 AG, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Anthony C.

letter,A single synthetic small molecule that generates force against a load,"<p>Some biomolecules are able to generate directional forces by rectifying random thermal motions. This allows these molecular machines to perform mechanical tasks such as intracellular cargo transport or muscle contraction in plants and animals. Although some artificial molecular machines have been synthesized and used collectively to perform mechanical tasks, so far there have been no direct measurements of mechanical processes at the single-molecule level. Here we report measurements of the mechanical work performed by a synthetic molecule less than 5&#160;nm long. We show that biased Brownian motion of the sub-molecular components in a hydrogen-bonded [2]rotaxane&#8212;a molecular ring threaded onto a molecular axle&#8212;can be harnessed to generate significant directional forces. We used the cantilever of an atomic force microscope to apply a mechanical load to the ring during single-molecule pulling&#8211;relaxing cycles. The ring was pulled along the axle, away from the thermodynamically favoured binding site, and was then found to travel back to this site against an external load of 30&#160;pN. Using fluctuation theorems, we were able to relate measurements of the work done at the level of individual rotaxane molecules to the free-energy change as previously determined from ensemble measurements. The results show that individual rotaxanes can generate directional forces of similar magnitude to those generated by natural molecular machines.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Liège, B6a Sart-Tilman, Liège, 4000, Belgium', 'authors': ['Perrine Lussis', ',\xa0Tiziana Svaldo-Lanero', '\xa0&\xa0Anne-Sophie Duwez']}, {'address': ""School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, The King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh, EH9 3JJ, UK"", 'authors': ['Andrea Bertocco', '\xa0&\xa0David A.

letter,Graphene nanoribbons with smooth edges behave as quantum wires,"<p>Graphene nanoribbons with perfect edges are predicted to exhibit interesting electronic and spintronic properties, notably quantum-confined bandgaps and magnetic edge states. However, so far, graphene nanoribbons produced by lithography have had rough edges, as well as low-temperature transport characteristics dominated by defects (mainly variable range hopping between localized states in a transport gap near the Dirac point). Here, we report that one- and two-layer nanoribbon quantum dots made by unzipping carbon nanotubes exhibit well-defined quantum transport phenomena, including Coulomb blockade, the Kondo effect, clear excited states up to &#8764;20 meV, and inelastic co-tunnelling.

letter,Solution-processed core–shell nanowires for efficient photovoltaic cells,"<p>Semiconductor nanowires are promising for photovoltaic applications, but, so far, nanowire-based solar cells have had lower efficiencies than planar cells made from the same materials, even allowing for the generally lower light absorption of nanowires. It is not clear, therefore, if the benefits of the nanowire structure, including better charge collection and transport and the possibility of enhanced absorption through light trapping, can outweigh the reductions in performance caused by recombination at the surface of the nanowires and at p&#8211;n junctions. Here, we fabricate core&#8211;shell nanowire solar cells with open-circuit voltage and fill factor values superior to those reported for equivalent planar cells, and an energy conversion efficiency of &#8764;5.4%, which is comparable to that of equivalent planar cells despite low light absorption levels. The device is made using a low-temperature solution-based cation exchange reaction that creates a heteroepitaxial junction between a single-crystalline CdS core and single-crystalline Cu<sub>2</sub>S shell. We integrate multiple cells on single nanowires in both series and parallel configurations for high output voltages and currents, respectively.

article,Self-assembly of self-limiting monodisperse supraparticles from polydisperse nanoparticles,"<p>Nanoparticles are known to self-assemble into larger structures through growth processes that typically occur continuously and depend on the uniformity of the individual nanoparticles.

This self-limiting growth process is governed by a balance between electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals attraction, which is aided by the broad polydispersity of the nanoparticles.

article,Photocurrent mapping of near-field optical antenna resonances,"<p>An increasing number of photonics applications make use of nanoscale optical antennas that exhibit a strong, resonant interaction with photons of a specific frequency. The resonant properties of such antennas are conventionally characterized by far-field light-scattering techniques. However, many applications require quantitative knowledge of the near-field behaviour, and existing local field measurement techniques provide only relative, rather than absolute, data. Here, we demonstrate a photodetector platform that uses a silicon-on-insulator substrate to spectrally and spatially map the absolute values of enhanced fields near any type of optical antenna by transducing local electric fields into photocurrent. We are able to quantify the resonant optical and materials properties of nanoscale (&#8764;50 nm) and wavelength-scale (&#8764;1 &#181;m) metallic antennas as well as high-refractive-index semiconductor antennas.

We use the outstanding T<sub>2</sub> contrast properties (r<sub>2</sub>&#160;=&#160;573&#8211;1,286&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;mM<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) of these ferri-liposomes, which are &#8764;95 nm in diameter, to non-invasively monitor drug delivery in vivo. We also visualize the targeting of the tumour microenvironment by the drug-loaded ferri-liposomes and the uptake of a model probe by cells. Furthermore, we used the ferri-liposomes to deliver a cathepsin protease inhibitor to a mammary tumour and its microenvironment in a mouse, which substantially reduced the size of the tumour compared with systemic delivery of the same drug.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular and Structural Biology, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia', 'authors': ['Georgy Mikhaylov', ',\xa0Ivan Psakhye', ',\xa0Vito Turk', ',\xa0Boris Turk', '\xa0&\xa0Olga Vasiljeva']}, {'address': 'Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia', 'authors': ['Ursa Mikac']}, {'address': 'Centre of Excellence EN-FIST, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia', 'authors': ['Ursa Mikac']}, {'address': 'Tomsk Scientific Center, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk, 634055, Russia', 'authors': ['Anna A.
