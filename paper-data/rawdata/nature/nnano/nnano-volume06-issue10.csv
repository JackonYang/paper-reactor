review article,Nanopore sensors for nucleic acid analysis,"<p>Nanopore analysis is an emerging technique that involves using a voltage to drive molecules through a nanoscale pore in a membrane between two electrolytes, and monitoring how the ionic current through the nanopore changes as single molecules pass through it. This approach allows charged polymers (including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA and RNA) to be analysed with subnanometre resolution and without the need for labels or amplification. Recent advances suggest that nanopore-based sensors could be competitive with other third-generation DNA sequencing technologies, and may be able to rapidly and reliably sequence the human genome for under $1,000. In this article we review the use of nanopore technology in DNA sequencing, genetics and medical diagnostics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61820, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Bala Murali Venkatesan', '\xa0&\xa0Rashid Bashir']}, {'address': 'Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61820, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Bala Murali Venkatesan', '\xa0&\xa0Rashid Bashir']}, {'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61820, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Rashid Bashir']}]",False,"['Bala Murali Venkatesan', 'Rashid Bashir']","Venkatesan, B., Bashir, R.

letter,Experimental demonstration of a single-molecule electric motor,"<p>For molecules to be used as components in molecular machines, methods that couple individual molecules to external energy sources and that selectively excite motion in a given direction are required. Significant progress has been made in the construction of molecular motors powered by light and by chemical reactions, but electrically driven motors have not yet been built, despite several theoretical proposals for such motors. Here we report that a butyl methyl sulphide molecule adsorbed on a copper surface can be operated as a single-molecule electric motor. Electrons from a scanning tunnelling microscope are used to drive the directional motion of the molecule in a two-terminal setup. Moreover, the temperature and electron flux can be adjusted to allow each rotational event to be monitored at the molecular scale in real time. The direction and rate of the rotation are related to the chiralities of both the molecule and the tip of the microscope (which serves as the electrode), illustrating the importance of the symmetry of the metal contacts in atomic-scale electrical devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Tufts University, Medford, 02155-5813, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Heather L.

letter,Graphene plasmonics for tunable terahertz metamaterials,"<p>Plasmons describe collective oscillations of electrons. They have a fundamental role in the dynamic responses of electron systems and form the basis of research into optical metamaterials. Plasmons of two-dimensional massless electrons, as present in graphene, show unusual behaviour that enables new tunable plasmonic metamaterials and, potentially, optoelectronic applications in the terahertz frequency range. Here we explore plasmon excitations in engineered graphene micro-ribbon arrays. We demonstrate that graphene plasmon resonances can be tuned over a broad terahertz frequency range by changing micro-ribbon width and in situ electrostatic doping. The ribbon width and carrier doping dependences of graphene plasmon frequency demonstrate power-law behaviour characteristic of two-dimensional massless Dirac electrons. The plasmon resonances have remarkably large oscillator strengths, resulting in prominent room-temperature optical absorption peaks. In comparison, plasmon absorption in a conventional two-dimensional electron gas was observed only at 4.2&#160;K (refs). The results represent a first look at light&#8211;plasmon coupling in graphene and point to potential graphene-based terahertz metamaterials.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Long Ju', ',\xa0Baisong Geng', ',\xa0Jason Horng', ',\xa0Caglar Girit', ',\xa0Alex Zettl', ',\xa0Y.

letter,Direct observation of a propagating spin wave induced by spin-transfer torque,"<p>Spin torque oscillators with nanoscale electrical contacts are able to produce coherent spin waves in extended magnetic films, and offer an attractive combination of electrical and magnetic field control, broadband operation, fast spin-wave frequency modulation, and the possibility of synchronizing multiple spin-wave injection sites. However, many potential applications rely on propagating (as opposed to localized) spin waves, and direct evidence for propagation has been lacking. Here, we directly observe a propagating spin wave launched from a spin torque oscillator with a nanoscale electrical contact into an extended Permalloy (nickel iron) film through the spin transfer torque effect. The data, obtained by wave-vector-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering, show that spin waves with tunable frequencies can propagate for several micrometres.

letter,Gold nanoparticles for high-throughput genotyping of long-range haplotypes,"<p>Completion of the Human Genome Project and the HapMap Project has led to increasing demands for mapping complex traits in humans to understand the aetiology of diseases. Identifying variations in the DNA sequence, which affect how we develop disease and respond to pathogens and drugs, is important for this purpose, but it is difficult to identify these variations in large sample sets. Here we show that through a combination of capillary sequencing and polymerase chain reaction assisted by gold nanoparticles, it is possible to identify several DNA variations that are associated with age-related macular degeneration and psoriasis on significant regions of human genomic DNA.

letter,Alpha-alumina nanoparticles induce efficient autophagy-dependent cross-presentation and potent antitumour response,"<p>Therapeutic cancer vaccination is an attractive strategy because it induces T cells of the immune system to recognize and kill tumour cells in cancer patients. However, it remains difficult to generate large numbers of T cells that can recognize the antigens on cancer cells using conventional vaccine carrier systems.

We found that &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles delivered antigens to autophagosomes in dendritic cells, which then presented the antigens to T cells through autophagy. Immunization of mice with &#945;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles that are conjugated to either a model tumour antigen or autophagosomes derived from tumour cells resulted in tumour regression.

article,Graphene oxide windows for in situ environmental cell photoelectron spectroscopy,"<p>The performance of new materials and devices often depends on processes taking place at the interface between an active solid element and the environment (such as air, water or other fluids). Understanding and controlling such interfacial processes require surface-specific spectroscopic information acquired under real-world operating conditions, which can be challenging because standard approaches such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy generally require high-vacuum conditions. The state-of-the-art approach to this problem relies on unique and expensive apparatus including electron analysers coupled with sophisticated differentially pumped lenses. Here, we develop a simple environmental cell with graphene oxide windows that are transparent to low-energy electrons (down to 400&#160;eV), and demonstrate the feasibility of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements on model samples such as gold nanoparticles and aqueous salt solution placed on the back side of a window.

article,Thermodynamically stable RNA three-way junction for constructing multifunctional nanoparticles for delivery of therapeutics,"<p>RNA nanoparticles have applications in the treatment of cancers and viral infection; however, the instability of RNA nanoparticles has hindered their development for therapeutic applications. The lack of covalent linkage or crosslinking in nanoparticles causes dissociation in vivo. Here we show that the packaging RNA of bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor can be assembled from 3&#8211;6 pieces of RNA oligomers without the use of metal salts. Each RNA oligomer contains a functional module that can be a receptor-binding ligand, aptamer, short interfering RNA or ribozyme. When mixed together, they self-assemble into thermodynamically stable tri-star nanoparticles with a three-way junction core. These nanoparticles are resistant to 8&#160;M urea denaturation, are stable in serum and remain intact at extremely low concentrations. The modules remain functional in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the three-way junction core can be used as a platform for building a variety of multifunctional nanoparticles. We studied 25 different three-way junction motifs in biological RNA and found only one other motif that shares characteristics similar to the three-way junction of phi29 pRNA.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nanobiomedical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, 45267, Ohio, USA', 'authors': ['Dan Shu', ',\xa0Yi Shu', ',\xa0Farzin Haque', '\xa0&\xa0Peixuan Guo']}, {'address': 'Kylin Therapeutics, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47906, USA', 'authors': ['Sherine Abdelmawla']}]",False,"['Dan Shu', 'Yi Shu', 'Farzin Haque', 'Sherine Abdelmawla', 'Peixuan Guo']","Shu, D., Shu, Y., Haque, F. et al.

The sensor, which uses a programmable oligonucleotide probe to generate a target-specific signature signal, can quantify subpicomolar levels of cancer-associated microRNAs and can distinguish single-nucleotide differences between microRNA family members.

article,A multifunctional core–shell nanoparticle for dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy,"<p>Dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy requires tumour antigens to be delivered efficiently into dendritic cells and their migration to be monitored in vivo. Nanoparticles have been explored as carriers for antigen delivery, but applications have been limited by the toxicity of the solvents used to make nanoparticles, and by the need to use transfection agents to deliver nanoparticles into cells. Here we show that an iron oxide&#8211;zinc oxide core&#8211;shell nanoparticle can deliver carcinoembryonic antigen into dendritic cells while simultaneously acting as an imaging agent. The nanoparticle&#8211;antigen complex is efficiently taken up by dendritic cells within one hour and can be detected in vitro by confocal microscopy and in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. Mice immunized with dendritic cells containing the nanoparticle&#8211;antigen complex showed enhanced tumour antigen specific T-cell responses, delayed tumour growth and better survival than controls.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Institute of Endemic Diseases, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Nam-Hyuk Cho', ',\xa0Taek-Chin Cheong', '\xa0&\xa0Seung-Yong Seong']}, {'address': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Institute of Endemic Diseases, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Nam-Hyuk Cho', ',\xa0Taek-Chin Cheong', '\xa0&\xa0Seung-Yong Seong']}, {'address': 'Bundang Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Nam-Hyuk Cho']}, {'address': 'Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Taek-Chin Cheong', ',\xa0Sang Jin Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Daehong Kim']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Ji Hyun Min', '\xa0&\xa0Young Keun Kim']}, {'address': 'Pioneer Research Center for Biomedical Nanocrystals, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Ji Hyun Min', ',\xa0Jun Hua Wu', ',\xa0Young Keun Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Seung-Yong Seong']}, {'address': 'Department of Life Science and School of Interdisciplinary Bioscience and Bioengineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyungbuk, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Jae-Seong Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Sanguk Kim']}]",False,"['Nam-Hyuk Cho', 'Taek-Chin Cheong', 'Ji Hyun Min', 'Jun Hua Wu', 'Sang Jin Lee', 'Daehong Kim', 'Jae-Seong Yang', 'Sanguk Kim', 'Young Keun Kim', 'Seung-Yong Seong']","Cho, N., Cheong, T., Min, J. et al.A multifunctional core–shell nanoparticle for dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy.
