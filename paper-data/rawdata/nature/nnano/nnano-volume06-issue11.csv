letter,Ambipolar field effect in the ternary topological insulator (BixSb1–x)2Te3 by composition tuning,"<p>Topological insulators exhibit a bulk energy gap and spin-polarized surface states that lead to unique electronic properties, with potential applications in spintronics and quantum information processing. However, transport measurements have typically been dominated by residual bulk charge carriers originating from crystal defects or environmental doping, and these mask the contribution of surface carriers to charge transport in these materials. Controlling bulk carriers in current topological insulator materials, such as the binary sesquichalcogenides Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, has been explored extensively by means of material doping and electrical gating, but limited progress has been made to achieve nanostructures with low bulk conductivity for electronic device applications. Here we demonstrate that the ternary sesquichalcogenide (Bi<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>1&#8211;x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> is a tunable topological insulator system. By tuning the ratio of bismuth to antimony, we are able to reduce the bulk carrier density by over two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the topological insulator properties. As a result, we observe a clear ambipolar gating effect in (Bi<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>1&#8211;x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> nanoplate field-effect transistor devices, similar to that observed in graphene field-effect transistor devices. The manipulation of carrier type and density in topological insulator nanostructures demonstrated here paves the way for the implementation of topological insulators in nanoelectronics and spintronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Desheng Kong"", ""Yulin Chen"", ""Judy J.

letter,Step-like enhancement of luminescence quantum yield of silicon nanocrystals,"<p>Carrier multiplication by generation of two or more electron&#8211;hole pairs following the absorption of a single photon may lead to improved photovoltaic efficiencies and has been observed in nanocrystals made from a variety of semiconductors, including silicon. However, with few exceptions, these reports have been based on indirect ultrafast techniques. Here, we present evidence of carrier multiplication in closely spaced silicon nanocrystals contained in a silicon dioxide matrix by measuring enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield. As the photon energy increases, the quantum yield is expected to remain constant, or to decrease as a result of new trapping and recombination channels being activated. Instead, we observe a step-like increase in quantum yield for larger photon energies that is characteristic of carrier multiplication. Modelling suggests that carrier multiplication is occurring with high efficiency and close to the energy conservation limit.</p>",[],False,"[""D. Timmerman"", ""J. Valenta"", ""K.

letter,Cell entry of one-dimensional nanomaterials occurs by tip recognition and rotation,"<p>Materials with high aspect ratio, such as carbon nanotubes and asbestos fibres, have been shown to cause length-dependent toxicity in certain cells because these long materials prevent complete ingestion and this frustrates the cell. Biophysical models have been proposed to explain how spheres and elliptical nanostructures enter cells, but one-dimensional nanomaterials have not been examined. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that cylindrical one-dimensional nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes enter cells through the tip first. For nanotubes with end caps or carbon shells at their tips, uptake involves tip recognition through receptor binding, rotation that is driven by asymmetric elastic strain at the tube&#8211;bilayer interface, and near-vertical entry. The precise angle of entry is governed by the relative timescales for tube rotation and receptor diffusion. Nanotubes without caps or shells on their tips show a different mode of membrane interaction, posing an interesting question as to whether modifying the tips of tubes may help avoid frustrated uptake by cells.</p>",[],False,"[""Xinghua Shi"", ""Annette von dem Bussche"", ""Robert H.

letter,Nanowired three-dimensional cardiac patches,"<p>Engineered cardiac patches for treating damaged heart tissues after a heart attack are normally produced by seeding heart cells within three-dimensional porous biomaterial scaffolds. These biomaterials, which are usually made of either biological polymers such as alginate or synthetic polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), help cells organize into functioning tissues, but poor conductivity of these materials limits the ability of the patch to contract strongly as a unit. Here, we show that incorporating gold nanowires within alginate scaffolds can bridge the electrically resistant pore walls of alginate and improve electrical communication between adjacent cardiac cells. Tissues grown on these composite matrices were thicker and better aligned than those grown on pristine alginate and when electrically stimulated, the cells in these tissues contracted synchronously. Furthermore, higher levels of the proteins involved in muscle contraction and electrical coupling are detected in the composite matrices. It is expected that the integration of conducting nanowires within three-dimensional scaffolds may improve the therapeutic value of current cardiac patches.</p>",[],False,"[""Tal Dvir"", ""Brian P.

article,Dynamic manipulation of nanomechanical resonators in the high-amplitude regime and non-volatile mechanical memory operation,"<p>The ability to control mechanical motion with optical forces has made it possible to cool mechanical resonators to their quantum ground states. The same techniques can also be used to amplify rather than reduce the mechanical motion of such systems. Here, we study nanomechanical resonators that are slightly buckled and therefore have two stable configurations, denoted &#8216;buckled up&#8217; and &#8216;buckled down&#8217;, when they are at rest. The motion of these resonators can be described by a double-well potential with a large central energy barrier between the two stable configurations. We demonstrate the high-amplitude operation of a buckled resonator coupled to an optical cavity by using a highly efficient process to generate enough phonons in the resonator to overcome the energy barrier in the double-well potential. This allows us to observe the first evidence for nanomechanical slow-down and a zero-frequency singularity predicted by theorists. We also demonstrate a non-volatile mechanical memory element in which bits are written and reset by using optomechanical backaction to direct the relaxation of a resonator in the high-amplitude regime to a specific stable configuration.</p>",[],False,"[""Mahmood Bagheri"", ""Menno Poot"", ""Mo Li"", ""Wolfram P.

These devices require high yields of photogenerated charges and high carrier mobilities, which are difficult to achieve in quantum-dot films owing to a strong electron&#8211;hole interaction and quantum confinement. Here, we show that the quantum yield of photogenerated charges in strongly coupled PbSe quantum-dot films is unity over a large temperature range. At high photoexcitation density, a transition takes place from hopping between localized states to band-like transport. These strongly coupled quantum-dot films have electrical properties that approach those of crystalline bulk semiconductors, while retaining the size tunability and cheap processing properties of colloidal quantum dots.</p>",[],False,"[""Elise Talgorn"", ""Yunan Gao"", ""Michiel Aerts"", ""Lucas T.

article,Dynamic internal gradients control and direct electric currents within nanostructured materials,"<p>Switchable nanomaterials&#8212;materials that can change their properties and/or function in response to external stimuli&#8212;have potential applications in electronics, sensing and catalysis. Previous efforts to develop such materials have predominately used molecular switches that can modulate their properties by means of conformational changes. Here, we show that electrical conductance through films of gold nanoparticles coated with a monolayer of charged ligands can be controlled by dynamic, long-range gradients of both mobile counterions surrounding the nanoparticles and conduction electrons on the nanoparticle cores. The internal gradients and the electric fields they create are easily reconfigurable, and can be set up in such a way that electric currents through the nanoparticles can be modulated, blocked or even deflected so that they only pass through select regions of the material. The nanoion/counterion hybrids combine the properties of electronic conductors with those of ionic gels/polymers, are easy to process by solution-casting and, by controlling the internal gradients, can be reconfigured into different electronic elements (current rectifiers, switches and diodes).</p>",[],False,"[""Hideyuki Nakanishi"", ""David A.

article,Nanochannel electroporation delivers precise amounts of biomolecules into living cells,"<p>Many transfection techniques can deliver biomolecules into cells, but the dose cannot be controlled precisely. Delivering well-defined amounts of materials into cells is important for various biological studies and therapeutic applications. Here, we show that nanochannel electroporation can deliver precise amounts of a variety of transfection agents into living cells. The device consists of two microchannels connected by a nanochannel. The cell to be transfected is positioned in one microchannel using optical tweezers, and the transfection agent is located in the second microchannel. Delivering a voltage pulse between the microchannels produces an intense electric field over a very small area on the cell membrane, allowing a precise amount of transfection agent to be electrophoretically driven through the nanochannel, the cell membrane and into the cell cytoplasm, without affecting cell viability. Dose control is achieved by adjusting the duration and number of pulses. The nanochannel electroporation device is expected to have high-throughput delivery applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Pouyan E.
