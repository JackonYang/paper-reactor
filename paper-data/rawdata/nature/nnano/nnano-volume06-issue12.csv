review article,Challenges and opportunities for structural DNA nanotechnology,"<p>DNA molecules have been used to build a variety of nanoscale structures and devices over the past 30 years, and potential applications have begun to emerge. But the development of more advanced structures and applications will require a number of issues to be addressed, the most significant of which are the high cost of DNA and the high error rate of self-assembly. Here we examine the technical challenges in the field of structural DNA nanotechnology and outline some of the promising applications that could be developed if these hurdles can be overcome. In particular, we highlight the potential use of DNA nanostructures in molecular and cellular biophysics, as biomimetic systems, in energy transfer and photonics, and in diagnostics and therapeutics for human health.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Single Molecule Biophysics, The Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, 85287, Arizona, USA', 'authors': ['Andre V.

letter,A decision-directed approach for prioritizing research into the impact of nanomaterials on the environment and human health,"<p>The emergence of nanotechnology has coincided with an increased recognition of the need for new approaches to understand and manage the impact of emerging technologies on the environment and human health. Important elements in these new approaches include life-cycle thinking, public participation and adaptive management of the risks associated with emerging technologies and new materials. However, there is a clear need to develop a framework for linking research on the risks associated with nanotechnology to the decision-making needs of manufacturers, regulators, consumers and other stakeholder groups. Given the very high uncertainties associated with nanomaterials and their impact on the environment and human health, research resources should be directed towards creating the knowledge that is most meaningful to these groups.

letter,Skin-like pressure and strain sensors based on transparent elastic films of carbon nanotubes,"<p>Transparent, elastic conductors are essential components of electronic and optoelectronic devices that facilitate human interaction and biofeedback, such as interactive electronics, implantable medical devices and robotic systems with human-like sensing capabilities. The availability of conducting thin films with these properties could lead to the development of skin-like sensors that stretch reversibly, sense pressure (not just touch), bend into hairpin turns, integrate with collapsible, stretchable and mechanically robust displays and solar cells, and also wrap around non-planar and biological surfaces such as skin and organs, without wrinkling. We report transparent, conducting spray-deposited films of single-walled carbon nanotubes that can be rendered stretchable by applying strain along each axis, and then releasing this strain. This process produces spring-like structures in the nanotubes that accommodate strains of up to 150% and demonstrate conductivities as high as 2,200&#160;S&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in the stretched state. We also use the nanotube films as electrodes in arrays of transparent, stretchable capacitors, which behave as pressure and strain sensors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Darren J.

letter,Positive and negative Coulomb drag in vertically integrated one-dimensional quantum wires,"<p>Electron interactions in and between wires become increasingly complex and important as circuits are scaled to nanometre sizes, or use reduced-dimensional conductors such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires and gated high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems. This is because the screening of the long-range Coulomb potential of individual carriers is weakened in these systems, which can lead to phenomena such as Coulomb drag, where a current in one wire induces a voltage in a second wire through Coulomb interactions alone. Previous experiments have demonstrated Coulomb electron drag in wires separated by a soft electrostatic barrier of width &#8819;80 nm (ref.), which was interpreted as resulting entirely from momentum transfer. Here, we measure both positive and negative drag between adjacent vertical quantum wires that are separated by &#8764;15 nm and have independent contacts, which allows their electron densities to be tuned independently. We map out the drag signal versus the number of electron sub-bands occupied in each wire, and interpret the results both in terms of momentum-transfer and charge-fluctuation induced transport models. For wires of significantly different sub-band occupancies, the positive drag effect can be as large as 25%.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, McGill University, Montreal, H3A 2T8, Canada', 'authors': ['D.

letter,Electric-field-induced wetting and dewetting in single hydrophobic nanopores,"<p>The behaviour of water in nanopores is very different from that of bulk water. Close to hydrophobic surfaces, the water density has been found to be lower than in the bulk, and if confined in a sufficiently narrow hydrophobic nanopore, water can spontaneously evaporate. Molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that a nanopore can be switched between dry and wet states by applying an electric potential across the nanopore membrane. Nanopores with hydrophobic walls could therefore create a gate system for water, and also for ionic and neutral species. Here, we show that single hydrophobic nanopores can undergo reversible wetting and dewetting due to condensation and evaporation of water inside the pores. The reversible process is observed as fluctuations between conducting and non-conducting ionic states and can be regulated by a transmembrane electric potential.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Irvine, 92697, California, USA', 'authors': ['Matthew R.

letter,Formation of droplet networks that function in aqueous environments,"<p>Aqueous droplets in oil that are coated with lipid monolayers and joined through interface bilayers are useful for biophysical measurements on membrane proteins. Functional networks of droplets that can act as light sensors, batteries and electrical components can also be made by incorporating pumps, channels and pores into the bilayers. These networks of droplets mimic simple tissues, but so far have not been used in physiological environments because they have been constrained to a bulk oil phase. Here, we form structures called multisomes in which networks of aqueous droplets with defined compositions are encapsulated within small drops of oil in water. The encapsulated droplets adhere to one another and to the surface of the oil drop to form interface bilayers that allow them to communicate with each other and with the surrounding aqueous environment through membrane pores. The contents in the droplets can be released by changing the pH or temperature of the surrounding solution. The multicompartment framework of multisomes mimics a tissue and has potential applications in synthetic biology and medicine.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3TA, UK', 'authors': ['Gabriel Villar', '\xa0&\xa0Hagan Bayley']}]",False,"['Gabriel Villar', 'Andrew J.

letter,Mapping nanomechanical properties of live cells using multi-harmonic atomic force microscopy,"<p>The nanomechanical properties of living cells, such as their surface elastic response and adhesion, have important roles in cellular processes such as morphogenesis, mechano-transduction, focal adhesion, motility, metastasis and drug delivery. Techniques based on quasi-static atomic force microscopy techniques can map these properties, but they lack the spatial and temporal resolution that is needed to observe many of the relevant details. Here, we present a dynamic atomic force microscopy method to map quantitatively the nanomechanical properties of live cells with a throughput (measured in pixels/minute) that is &#8764;10&#8211;1,000 times higher than that achieved with quasi-static atomic force microscopy techniques. The local properties of a cell are derived from the 0th, 1st and 2nd harmonic components of the Fourier spectrum of the AFM cantilevers interacting with the cell surface. Local stiffness, stiffness gradient and the viscoelastic dissipation of live Escherichia coli bacteria, rat fibroblasts and human red blood cells were all mapped in buffer solutions. Our method is compatible with commercial atomic force microscopes and could be used to analyse mechanical changes in tumours, cells and biofilm formation with sub-10&#160;nm detail.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA', 'authors': ['A.

article,Accumulation of sub-100 nm polymeric micelles in poorly permeable tumours depends on size,"<p>A major goal in cancer research is to develop carriers that can deliver drugs effectively and without side effects. Liposomal and particulate carriers with diameters of &#8764;100 nm have been widely used to improve the distribution and tumour accumulation of cancer drugs, but so far they have only been effective for treating highly permeable tumours. Here, we compare the accumulation and effectiveness of different sizes of long-circulating, drug-loaded polymeric micelles (with diameters of 30, 50, 70 and 100 nm) in both highly and poorly permeable tumours. All the polymer micelles penetrated highly permeable tumours in mice, but only the 30 nm micelles could penetrate poorly permeable pancreatic tumours to achieve an antitumour effect. We also showed that the penetration and efficacy of the larger micelles could be enhanced by using a transforming growth factor-&#946; inhibitor to increase the permeability of the tumours.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan', 'authors': ['H.

article,Signalling of DNA damage and cytokines across cell barriers exposed to nanoparticles depends on barrier thickness,"<p>The use of nanoparticles in medicine is ever increasing, and it is important to understand their targeted and non-targeted effects. We have previously shown that nanoparticles can cause DNA damage to cells cultured below a cellular barrier without crossing this barrier. Here, we show that this indirect DNA damage depends on the thickness of the cellular barrier, and it is mediated by signalling through gap junction proteins following the generation of mitochondrial free radicals. Indirect damage was seen across both trophoblast and corneal barriers. Signalling, including cytokine release, occurred only across bilayer and multilayer barriers, but not across monolayer barriers. Indirect toxicity was also observed in mice and using ex vivo explants of the human placenta. If the importance of barrier thickness in signalling is a general feature for all types of barriers, our results may offer a principle with which to limit the adverse effects of nanoparticle exposure and offer new therapeutic approaches.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Bristol Musculoskeletal Research Unit, Clinical Science at North Bristol University of Bristol, Avon Orthopaedic Centre, Southmead Hospital, Bristol, BS10 5NB, UK', 'authors': ['A.
