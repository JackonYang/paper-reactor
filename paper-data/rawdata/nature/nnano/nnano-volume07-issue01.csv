review article,The properties and applications of nanodiamonds,"<p>Nanodiamonds have excellent mechanical and optical properties, high surface areas and tunable surface structures. They are also non-toxic, which makes them well suited to biomedical applications. Here we review the synthesis, structure, properties, surface chemistry and phase transformations of individual nanodiamonds and clusters of nanodiamonds. In particular we discuss the rational control of the mechanical, chemical, electronic and optical properties of nanodiamonds through surface doping, interior doping and the introduction of functional groups. These little gems have a wide range of potential applications in tribology, drug delivery, bioimaging and tissue engineering, and also as protein mimics and a filler material for nanocomposites.</p>",[],False,"[""Vadym N.

letter,Synthetically programmable nanoparticle superlattices using a hollow three-dimensional spacer approach,"<p>Crystalline nanoparticle arrays and superlattices with well-defined geometries can be synthesized by using appropriate electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding or biological recognition interactions. Although superlattices with many distinct geometries can be produced using these approaches, the library of achievable lattices could be increased by developing a strategy that allows some of the nanoparticles within a binary lattice to be replaced with &#8216;spacer&#8217; entities that are constructed to mimic the behaviour of the nanoparticles they replace, even though they do not contain an inorganic core. The inclusion of these spacer entities within a known binary superlattice would effectively delete one set of nanoparticles without affecting the positions of the other set. Here, we show how hollow DNA nanostructures can be used as &#8216;three-dimensional spacers&#8217; within nanoparticle superlattices assembled through programmable DNA interactions. We show that this strategy can be used to form superlattices with five distinct symmetries, including one that has never before been observed in any crystalline material.</p>",[],False,"[""Evelyn Auyeung"", ""Joshua I.

letter,Direct visualization of large-area graphene domains and boundaries by optical birefringency,"<p>The boundaries between domains in single-layer graphene strongly influence its electronic properties. However, existing approaches for domain visualization, which are based on microscopy and spectroscopy, are only effective for domains that are less than a few micrometres in size. Here, we report a simple method for the visualization of arbitrarily large graphene domains by imaging the birefringence of a graphene surface covered with nematic liquid crystals. The method relies on a correspondence between the orientation of the liquid crystals and that of the underlying graphene, which we use to determine the boundaries of macroscopic domains.</p>",[],False,"[""Dae Woo Kim"", ""Yun Ho Kim"", ""Hyeon Su Jeong"", ""Hee-Tae Jung""]","Kim, D., Kim, Y., Jeong, H. et al.

letter,Mechanically controlled molecular orbital alignment in single molecule junctions,"<p>Research in molecular electronics often involves the demonstration of devices that are analogous to conventional semiconductor devices, such as transistors and diodes, but it is also possible to perform experiments that have no parallels in conventional electronics. For example, by applying a mechanical force to a molecule bridged between two electrodes, a device known as a molecular junction, it is possible to exploit the interplay between the electrical and mechanical properties of the molecule to control charge transport through the junction. 1,4&#8242;-Benzenedithiol is the most widely studied molecule in molecular electronics, and it was shown recently that the molecular orbitals can be gated by an applied electric field. Here, we report how the electromechanical properties of a 1,4&#8242;-benzenedithiol molecular junction change as the junction is stretched and compressed. Counterintuitively, the conductance increases by more than an order of magnitude during stretching, and then decreases again as the junction is compressed. Based on simultaneously recorded current&#8211;voltage and conductance&#8211;voltage characteristics, and inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy, we attribute this finding to a strain-induced shift of the highest occupied molecular orbital towards the Fermi level of the electrodes, leading to a resonant enhancement of the conductance. These results, which are in agreement with the predictions of theoretical models, also clarify the origins of the long-standing discrepancy between the calculated and measured conductance values of 1,4&#8242;-benzenedithiol, which often differ by orders of magnitude.</p>",[],False,"[""Christopher Bruot"", ""Joshua Hihath"", ""Nongjian Tao""]","Bruot, C., Hihath, J. & Tao, N.

letter,A surface-anchored molecular four-level conductance switch based on single proton transfer,"<p>The development of a variety of nanoscale applications requires the fabrication and control of atomic or molecular switches that can be reversibly operated by light, a short-range force, electric current or other external stimuli. For such molecules to be used as electronic components, they should be directly coupled to a metallic support and the switching unit should be easily connected to other molecular species without suppressing switching performance. Here, we show that a free-base tetraphenyl-porphyrin molecule, which is anchored to a silver surface, can function as a molecular conductance switch. The saddle-shaped molecule has two hydrogen atoms in its inner cavity that can be flipped between two states with different local conductance levels using the electron current through the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. Moreover, by deliberately removing one of the hydrogens, a four-level conductance switch can be created. The resulting device, which could be controllably integrated into the surrounding nanoscale environment, relies on the transfer of a single proton and therefore contains the smallest possible atomistic switching unit.</p>",[],False,"[""Willi Auw\u00e4rter"", ""Knud Seufert"", ""Felix Bischoff"", ""David Ecija"", ""Saranyan Vijayaraghavan"", ""Sushobhan Joshi"", ""Florian Klappenberger"", ""Niveditha Samudrala"", ""Johannes V.

letter,Hole spin relaxation in Ge–Si core–shell nanowire qubits,"<p>Controlling decoherence is the biggest challenge in efforts to develop quantum information hardware. Single electron spins in gallium arsenide are a leading candidate among implementations of solid-state quantum bits, but their strong coupling to nuclear spins produces high decoherence rates. Group IV semiconductors, on the other hand, have relatively low nuclear spin densities, making them an attractive platform for spin quantum bits. However, device fabrication remains a challenge, particularly with respect to the control of materials and interfaces. Here, we demonstrate state preparation, pulsed gate control and charge-sensing spin readout of hole spins confined in a Ge&#8211;Si core&#8211;shell nanowire. With fast gating, we measure T<sub>1</sub> spin relaxation times of up to 0.6&#160;ms in coupled quantum dots at zero magnetic field. Relaxation time increases as the magnetic field is reduced, which is consistent with a spin&#8211;orbit mechanism that is usually masked by hyperfine contributions.</p>",[],False,"[""Yongjie Hu"", ""Ferdinand Kuemmeth"", ""Charles M.

letter,Mixing subattolitre volumes in a quantitative and highly parallel manner with soft matter nanofluidics,"<p>Handling and mixing ultrasmall volumes of reactants in parallel can increase the throughput and complexity of screening assays while simultaneously reducing reagent consumption. Microfabricated silicon and plastic can provide reliable fluidic devices, but cannot typically handle total volumes smaller than &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8211;12</sup>&#160;l. Self-assembled soft matter nanocontainers can in principle significantly improve miniaturization and biocompatibility, but exploiting their full potential is a challenge due to their small dimensions. Here, we show that small unilamellar lipid vesicles can be used to mix volumes as small as 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8211;19</sup> l in a reproducible and highly parallelized fashion. The self-enclosed nanoreactors are functionalized with lipids of opposite charge to achieve reliable fusion. Single vesicles encapsulating one set of reactants are immobilized on a glass surface and then fused with diffusing vesicles of opposite charge that carry a complementary set of reactants. We find that &#8764;85% of the &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup> surface-tethered nanoreactors undergo non-deterministic fusion, which is leakage-free in all cases, and the system allows up to three to four consecutive mixing events per nanoreactor.</p>",[],False,"[""Sune M.

letter,Label-free imaging of semiconducting and metallic carbon nanotubes in cells and mice using transient absorption microscopy,"<p>As interest in the potential biomedical applications of carbon nanotubes increases, there is a need for methods that can image nanotubes in live cells, tissues and animals. Although techniques such as Raman, photoacoustic and near-infrared photoluminescence imaging have been used to visualize nanotubes in biological environments, these techniques are limited because nanotubes provide only weak photoluminescence and low Raman scattering and it remains difficult to image both semiconducting and metallic nanotubes at the same time. Here, we show that transient absorption microscopy offers a label-free method to image both semiconducting and metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes in vitro and in vivo, in real time, with submicrometre resolution. By using appropriate near-infrared excitation wavelengths, we detect strong transient absorption signals with opposite phases from semiconducting and metallic nanotubes. Our method separates background signals generated by red blood cells and this allows us to follow the movement of both types of nanotubes inside cells and in the blood circulation and organs of mice without any significant damaging effects.</p>",[],False,"[""Ling Tong"", ""Yuxiang Liu"", ""Bridget D.

letter,Role of cell cycle on the cellular uptake and dilution of nanoparticles in a cell population,"<p>Nanoparticles are considered a primary vehicle for targeted therapies because they can pass biological barriers and enter and distribute within cells by energy-dependent pathways. So far, most studies have shown that nanoparticle properties, such as size and surface, can influence how cells internalize nanoparticles. Here, we show that uptake of nanoparticles by cells is also influenced by their cell cycle phase. Although cells in different phases of the cell cycle were found to internalize nanoparticles at similar rates, after 24&#160;h the concentration of nanoparticles in the cells could be ranked according to the different phases: G2/M&#160;&gt;&#160;S&#160;&gt;&#160;G0/G1. Nanoparticles that are internalized by cells are not exported from cells but are split between daughter cells when the parent cell divides. Our results suggest that future studies on nanoparticle uptake should consider the cell cycle, because, in a cell population, the dose of internalized nanoparticles in each cell varies as the cell advances through the cell cycle.</p>",[],False,"[""Jong Ah Kim"", ""Christoffer \u00c5berg"", ""Anna Salvati"", ""Kenneth A.

article,One- and two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities in single crystal diamond,"<p>Diamond is an attractive material for photonic quantum technologies because its colour centres have a number of outstanding properties, including bright single photon emission and long spin coherence times. To take advantage of these properties it is favourable to directly fabricate optical microcavities in high-quality diamond samples. Such microcavities could be used to control the photons emitted by the colour centres or to couple widely separated spins. Here, we present a method for the fabrication of one- and two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavities with quality factors of up to 700 in single crystal diamond. Using a post-processing etching technique, we tune the cavity modes into resonance with the zero phonon line of an ensemble of silicon-vacancy colour centres, and we measure an intensity enhancement factor of 2.8.
