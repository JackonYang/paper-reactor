letter,Probing and repairing damaged surfaces with nanoparticle-containing microcapsules,"<p>Nanoparticles have useful properties, but it is often important that they only start working after they are placed in a desired location. The encapsulation of nanoparticles allows their function to be preserved until they are released at a specific time or location, and this has been exploited in the development of self-healing materials and in applications such as drug delivery. Encapsulation has also been used to stabilize and control the release of substances, including flavours, fragrances and pesticides. We recently proposed a new technique for the repair of surfaces called &#8216;repair-and-go&#8217;. In this approach, a flexible microcapsule filled with a solution of nanoparticles rolls across a surface that has been damaged, stopping to repair any defects it encounters by releasing nanoparticles into them, then moving on to the next defect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the repair-and-go approach using droplets of oil that are stabilized with a polymer surfactant and contain CdSe nanoparticles. We show that these microcapsules can find the cracks on a surface and selectively deliver the nanoparticle contents into the crack, before moving on to find the next crack. Although the microcapsules are too large to enter the cracks, their flexible walls allow them to probe and adhere temporarily to the interior of the cracks. The release of nanoparticles is made possible by the thin microcapsule wall (comparable to the diameter of the nanoparticles) and by the favourable (hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic) interactions between the nanoparticle and the cracked surface.</p>",[],False,"[""Katrina Kratz"", ""Amrit Narasimhan"", ""Ravisubhash Tangirala"", ""SungCheal Moon"", ""Ravindra Revanur"", ""Santanu Kundu"", ""Hyun Suk Kim"", ""Alfred J.

letter,Enhanced and switchable nanoscale thermal conduction due to van der Waals interfaces,"<p>Understanding thermal transport in nanostructured materials is important for the development of energy conversion applications and the thermal management of microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. Most nanostructures interact through van der Waals interactions, and these interactions typically lead to a reduction in thermal transport. Here, we show that the thermal conductivity of a bundle of boron nanoribbons can be significantly higher than that of a single free-standing nanoribbon. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of the bundle can be switched between the enhanced values and that of a single nanoribbon by wetting the van der Waals interface between the nanoribbons with various solutions.</p>",[],False,"[""Juekuan Yang"", ""Yang Yang"", ""Scott W.

letter,Control over topological insulator photocurrents with light polarization,"<p>Three-dimensional topological insulators represent a new quantum phase of matter with spin-polarized surface states that are protected from backscattering. The static electronic properties of these surface states have been comprehensively imaged by both photoemission and tunnelling spectroscopies. Theorists have proposed that topological surface states can also exhibit novel electronic responses to light, such as topological quantum phase transitions and spin-polarized electrical currents. However, the effects of optically driving a topological insulator out of equilibrium have remained largely unexplored experimentally, and no photocurrents have been measured. Here, we show that illuminating the topological insulator Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> with circularly polarized light generates a photocurrent that originates from topological helical Dirac fermions, and that reversing the helicity of the light reverses the direction of the photocurrent. We also observe a photocurrent that is controlled by the linear polarization of light and argue that it may also have a topological surface state origin. This approach may allow the probing of dynamic properties of topological insulators and lead to novel opto-spintronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""J. W. McIver"", ""D. Hsieh"", ""H. Steinberg"", ""P.

letter,Solid-state memories based on ferroelectric tunnel junctions,"<p>Ferroic-order parameters are useful as state variables in non-volatile information storage media because they show a hysteretic dependence on their electric or magnetic field. Coupling ferroics with quantum-mechanical tunnelling allows a simple and fast readout of the stored information through the influence of ferroic orders on the tunnel current. For example, data in magnetic random-access memories are stored in the relative alignment of two ferromagnetic electrodes separated by a non-magnetic tunnel barrier, and data readout is accomplished by a tunnel current measurement. However, such devices based on tunnel magnetoresistance typically exhibit OFF/ON ratios of less than 4, and require high powers for write operations (&gt;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup>&#160;A&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>). Here, we report non-volatile memories with OFF/ON ratios as high as 100 and write powers as low as &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup>&#160;A&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> at room temperature by storing data in the electric polarization direction of a ferroelectric tunnel barrier. The junctions show large, stable, reproducible and reliable tunnel electroresistance, with resistance switching occurring at the coercive voltage of ferroelectric switching. These ferroelectric devices emerge as an alternative to other resistive memories, and have the advantage of not being based on voltage-induced migration of matter at the nanoscale, but on a purely electronic mechanism.</p>",[],False,"[""Andr\u00e9 Chanthbouala"", ""Arnaud Crassous"", ""Vincent Garcia"", ""Karim Bouzehouane"", ""St\u00e9phane Fusil"", ""Xavier Moya"", ""Julie Allibe"", ""Bruno Dlubak"", ""Julie Grollier"", ""St\u00e9phane Xavier"", ""Cyrile Deranlot"", ""Amir Moshar"", ""Roger Proksch"", ""Neil D.

letter,High-dynamic-range magnetometry with a single nuclear spin in diamond,"<p>Sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond are being developed to measure weak magnetic and electric fields at the nanoscale. However, such sensors rely on measurements of a shift in the Lamor frequency of the defect, so an accumulation of quantum phase causes the measurement signal to exhibit a periodic modulation. This means that the measurement time is either restricted to half of one oscillation period, which limits accuracy, or that the magnetic field range must be known in advance. Moreover, the precision increases only slowly (as T<sup>&#8722;0.5</sup>) with measurement time T (ref.&#160;). Here, we implement a quantum phase estimation algorithm on a single nuclear spin in diamond to combine both high sensitivity and high dynamic range. By achieving a scaling of the precision with time to T<sup>&#8722;0.85</sup>, we improve the sensitivity by a factor of 7.4 for an accessible field range of 16&#160;mT, or, alternatively, we improve the dynamic range by a factor of 130 for a sensitivity of 2.5&#160;&#181;T&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>. Quantum phase estimation algorithms have also recently been implemented using a single electron spin in a nitrogen-vacancy centre.

letter,High-dynamic-range magnetometry with a single electronic spin in diamond,"<p>Magnetic sensors capable of detecting nanoscale volumes of spins allow for non-invasive, element-specific probing. The error in such measurements is usually reduced by increasing the measurement time, and noise averaging the signal. However, achieving the best precision requires restricting the maximum possible field strength to much less than the spectral linewidth of the sensor. Quantum entanglement and squeezing can then be used to improve precision (although they are difficult to implement in solid-state environments). When the field strength is comparable to or greater than the spectral linewidth, an undesirable trade-off between field strength and signal precision occurs. Here, we implement novel phase estimation algorithms on a single electronic spin associated with the nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond to achieve an &#8764;8.5-fold improvement in the ratio of the maximum field strength to precision, for field magnitudes that are large (&#8764;0.3 mT) compared to the spectral linewidth of the sensor (&#8764;4.5 &#181;T). The field uncertainty in our approach scales as 1/T<sup>0.88</sup>, compared to 1/T<sup>0.5</sup> in the standard measurement approach, where T is the measurement time. Quantum phase estimation algorithms have also recently been implemented using a single nuclear spin in a nitrogen-vacancy centre. Besides their direct impact on applications in magnetic sensing and imaging at the nanoscale, these results may prove useful in improving a variety of high-precision spectroscopy techniques.</p>",[],False,"[""N.

letter,Ultrafast hot-carrier-dominated photocurrent in graphene,"<p>The combination of its high electron mobility, broadband absorption and ultrafast luminescence make graphene attractive for optoelectronic and photonic applications, including transparent electrodes, mode-locked lasers and high-speed optical modulators. Photo-excited carriers that have not cooled to the temperature of the graphene lattice are known as hot carriers, and may limit device speed and energy efficiency. However, their roles in charge and energy transport are not fully understood. Here, we use time-resolved scanning photocurrent microscopy to demonstrate that hot carriers, rather than phonons, dominate energy transport across a tunable graphene p&#8211;n junction excited by ultrafast laser pulses. The photocurrent response time varies from 1.5 ps at room temperature to 4 ps at 20 K, implying a fundamental bandwidth of &#8764;500 GHz (refs). Gate-dependent pump&#8211;probe measurements demonstrate that both thermoelectric and built-in electric field effects contribute to the photocurrent, with the contribution from each depending on the junction configuration. The photocurrent produced by a single pulsed laser also displays multiple polarity reversals as a function of carrier density, which is a possible signature of impact ionization.</p>",[],False,"[""Dong Sun"", ""Grant Aivazian"", ""Aaron M.

letter,Local electrical potential detection of DNA by nanowire–nanopore sensors,"<p>Nanopores could potentially be used to perform single-molecule DNA sequencing at low cost and with high throughput. Although single base resolution and differentiation have been demonstrated with nanopores using ionic current measurements, direct sequencing has not been achieved because of the difficulties in recording very small (&#8764;pA) ionic currents at a bandwidth consistent with fast translocation speeds. Here, we show that solid-state nanopores can be combined with silicon nanowire field-effect transistors to create sensors in which detection is localized and self-aligned at the nanopore. Well-defined field-effect transistor signals associated with DNA translocation are recorded when an ionic strength gradient is imposed across the nanopores. Measurements and modelling show that field-effect transistor signals are generated by highly localized changes in the electrical potential during DNA translocation, and that nanowire&#8211;nanopore sensors could enable large-scale integration with a high intrinsic bandwidth.</p>",[],False,"[""Ping Xie"", ""Qihua Xiong"", ""Ying Fang"", ""Quan Qing"", ""Charles M.

article,Photoluminescence imaging of electronic-impurity-induced exciton quenching in single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>The electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes can be altered by surface adsorption of electronic impurities or dopants. However, fully understanding the influence of these impurities is difficult because of the inherent complexity of the solution-based colloidal chemistry of nanotubes, and because of a lack of techniques for directly imaging dynamic processes involving these impurities. Here, we show that photoluminescence microscopy can be used to image exciton quenching in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes during the early stages of chemical doping with two different species. The addition of AuCl<sub>3</sub> leads to localized exciton-quenching sites, which are attributed to a mid-gap electronic impurity level, and the adsorbed species are also found sometimes to be mobile on the surface of the nanotubes.

article,Electrophoretically induced aqueous flow through single-walled carbon nanotube membranes,"<p>Electrophoresis, the motion of charged species through liquids and pores under the influence of an external electric field, has been the principle source of chemical pumping for numerous micro- and nanofluidic device platforms. Recent measurements of ion currents through single or few carbon nanotube channels have yielded values of ion mobility that range from close to the bulk mobility to values that are two to seven orders of magnitude higher than the bulk mobility. However, these experiments cannot directly measure ion flux. Experiments on membranes that contain a large number of nanotube pores allow the ion current and ion flux to be measured independently. Here, we report that the mobilities of ions within such membranes are approximately three times higher than the bulk mobility. Moreover, the induced electro-osmotic velocities are four orders of magnitude faster than those measured in conventional porous materials.
