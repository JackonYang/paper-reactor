letter,A local optical probe for measuring motion and stress in a nanoelectromechanical system,"<p>Nanoelectromechanical systems can be operated as ultrasensitive mass sensors and ultrahigh-frequency resonators, and can also be used to explore fundamental physical phenomena such as nonlinear damping and quantum effects in macroscopic objects. Various dissipation mechanisms are known to limit the mechanical quality factors of nanoelectromechanical systems and to induce aging due to material degradation, so there is a need for methods that can probe the motion of these systems, and the stresses within them, at the nanoscale. Here, we report a non-invasive local optical probe for the quantitative measurement of motion and stress within a nanoelectromechanical system, based on Fizeau interferometry and Raman spectroscopy. The system consists of a multilayer graphene resonator that is clamped to a gold film on an oxidized silicon surface. The resonator and the surface both act as mirrors and therefore define an optical cavity. Fizeau interferometry provides a calibrated measurement of the motion of the resonator, while Raman spectroscopy can probe the strain within the system and allows a purely spectral detection of mechanical resonance at the nanoscale.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut Néel, CNRS et Université Joseph Fourier, BP 166, Grenoble Cedex 9, F-38042, France', 'authors': ['Antoine Reserbat-Plantey', ',\xa0Laëtitia Marty', ',\xa0Olivier Arcizet', ',\xa0Nedjma Bendiab', '\xa0&\xa0Vincent Bouchiat']}]",False,"['Antoine Reserbat-Plantey', 'Laëtitia Marty', 'Olivier Arcizet', 'Nedjma Bendiab', 'Vincent Bouchiat']","Reserbat-Plantey, A., Marty, L., Arcizet, O. et al.A local optical probe for measuring motion and stress in a nanoelectromechanical system.

letter,Transport spectroscopy of symmetry-broken insulating states in bilayer graphene,"<p>Bilayer graphene is an attractive platform for studying new two-dimensional electron physics, because its flat energy bands are sensitive to out-of-plane electric fields and these bands magnify electron&#8211;electron interaction effects. Theory predicts a variety of interesting broken symmetry states when the electron density is at the carrier neutrality point, and some of these states are characterized by spontaneous mass gaps, which lead to insulating behaviour. These proposed gaps are analogous to the masses generated by broken symmetries in particle physics, and they give rise to large Berry phase effects accompanied by spontaneous quantum Hall effects. Although recent experiments have provided evidence for strong electronic correlations near the charge neutrality point, the presence of gaps remains controversial. Here, we report transport measurements in ultraclean double-gated bilayer graphene and use source&#8211;drain bias as a spectroscopic tool to resolve a gap of &#8764;2 meV at the charge neutrality point. The gap can be closed by a perpendicular electric field of strength &#8764;15 mV nm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, but it increases monotonically with magnetic field, with an apparent particle&#8211;hole asymmetry above the gap. These data represent the first spectroscopic mapping of the ground states in bilayer graphene in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Riverside, 92521, California, USA', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Atomically localized plasmon enhancement in monolayer graphene,"<p>Plasmons in graphene can be tuned by using electrostatic gating or chemical doping, and the ability to confine plasmons in very small regions could have applications in optoelectronics, plasmonics and transformation optics. However, little is known about how atomic-scale defects influence the plasmonic properties of graphene. Moreover, the smallest localized plasmon resonance observed in any material to date has been limited to around 10&#160;nm (refs&#160;). Here, we show that surface plasmon resonances in graphene can be enhanced locally at the atomic scale. Using electron energy-loss spectrum imaging in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, we find that a single point defect can act as an atomic antenna in the petahertz (10<sup>15</sup>&#160;Hz) frequency range, leading to surface plasmon resonances at the subnanometre scale.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, 37235, Tennessee, USA', 'authors': ['Wu Zhou', ',\xa0Jaekwang Lee', ',\xa0Sokrates T.

letter,Direct observation of the spin-dependent Peltier effect,"<p>The Peltier coefficient describes the amount of heat that is carried by an electrical current when it passes through a material. When two materials with different Peltier coefficients are placed in contact with one another, the Peltier effect causes a net flow of heat either towards or away from the interface between them. Spintronics describes the transport of electric charge and spin angular momentum by separate spin-up and spin-down channels in a device. The observation that spin-up and spin-down charge transport channels are able to transport heat independently of each other has raised the possibility that spin currents could be used to heat or cool the interface between materials with different spin-dependent Peltier coefficients. Here, we report the direct observation of the heating and cooling of such an interface by a spin current. We demonstrate this spin-dependent Peltier effect in a spin-valve pillar structure that consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-ferromagnetic metal. Using a three-dimensional finite-element model, we extract spin-dependent Peltier coefficients in the range &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.3&#160;mV for permalloy.

letter,A DNA-based molecular motor that can navigate a network of tracks,"<p>Synthetic molecular motors can be fuelled by the hydrolysis or hybridization of DNA. Such motors can move autonomously and programmably, and long-range transport has been observed on linear tracks. It has also been shown that DNA systems can compute. Here, we report a synthetic DNA-based system that integrates long-range transport and information processing. We show that the path of a motor through a network of tracks containing four possible routes can be programmed using instructions that are added externally or carried by the motor itself. When external control is used we find that 87% of the motors follow the correct path, and when internal control is used 71% of the motors follow the correct path. Programmable motion will allow the development of computing networks, molecular systems that can sort and process cargoes according to instructions that they carry, and assembly lines that can be reconfigured dynamically in response to changing demands.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK', 'authors': ['Shelley F.

letter,Intracellular recordings of action potentials by an extracellular nanoscale field-effect transistor,"<p>The ability to make electrical measurements inside cells has led to many important advances in electrophysiology. The patch clamp technique, in which a glass micropipette filled with electrolyte is inserted into a cell, offers both high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution. Ideally, the micropipette should be as small as possible to increase the spatial resolution and reduce the invasiveness of the measurement, but the overall performance of the technique depends on the impedance of the interface between the micropipette and the cell interior, which limits how small the micropipette can be. Techniques that involve inserting metal or carbon microelectrodes into cells are subject to similar constraints. Field-effect transistors (FETs) can also record electric potentials inside cells, and because their performance does not depend on impedance, they can be made much smaller than micropipettes and microelectrodes. Moreover, FET arrays are better suited for multiplexed measurements. Previously, we have demonstrated FET-based intracellular recording with kinked nanowire structures, but the kink configuration and device design places limits on the probe size and the potential for multiplexing. Here, we report a new approach in which a SiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube is synthetically integrated on top of a nanoscale FET. This nanotube penetrates the cell membrane, bringing the cell cytosol into contact with the FET, which is then able to record the intracellular transmembrane potential. Simulations show that the bandwidth of this branched intracellular nanotube FET (BIT-FET) is high enough for it to record fast action potentials even when the nanotube diameter is decreased to 3&#160;nm, a length scale well below that accessible with other methods. Studies of cardiomyocyte cells demonstrate that when phospholipid-modified BIT-FETs are brought close to cells, the nanotubes can spontaneously penetrate the cell membrane to allow the full-amplitude intracellular action potential to be recorded, thus showing that a stable and tight seal forms between the nanotube and cell membrane. We also show that multiple BIT-FETs can record multiplexed intracellular signals from both single cells and networks of cells.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Xiaojie Duan', ',\xa0Ruixuan Gao', ',\xa0Ping Xie', ',\xa0Quan Qing', ',\xa0Bozhi Tian', ',\xa0Xiaocheng Jiang', '\xa0&\xa0Charles M.

letter,Vertical nanowire electrode arrays as a scalable platform for intracellular interfacing to neuronal circuits,"<p>Deciphering the neuronal code&#8212;the rules by which neuronal circuits store and process information&#8212;is a major scientific challenge. Currently, these efforts are impeded by a lack of experimental tools that are sensitive enough to quantify the strength of individual synaptic connections and also scalable enough to simultaneously measure and control a large number of mammalian neurons with single-cell resolution. Here, we report a scalable intracellular electrode platform based on vertical nanowires that allows parallel electrical interfacing to multiple mammalian neurons. Specifically, we show that our vertical nanowire electrode arrays can intracellularly record and stimulate neuronal activity in dissociated cultures of rat cortical neurons and can also be used to map multiple individual synaptic connections. The scalability of this platform, combined with its compatibility with silicon nanofabrication techniques, provides a clear path towards simultaneous, high-fidelity interfacing with hundreds of individual neurons.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Jacob T.

letter,Intracellular recording of action potentials by nanopillar electroporation,"<p>Action potentials have a central role in the nervous system and in many cellular processes, notably those involving ion channels. The accurate measurement of action potentials requires efficient coupling between the cell membrane and the measuring electrodes. Intracellular recording methods such as patch clamping involve measuring the voltage or current across the cell membrane by accessing the cell interior with an electrode, allowing both the amplitude and shape of the action potentials to be recorded faithfully with high signal-to-noise ratios. However, the invasive nature of intracellular methods usually limits the recording time to a few hours, and their complexity makes it difficult to simultaneously record more than a few cells. Extracellular recording methods, such as multielectrode arrays and multitransistor arrays, are non-invasive and allow long-term and multiplexed measurements. However, extracellular recording sacrifices the one-to-one correspondence between the cells and electrodes, and also suffers from significantly reduced signal strength and quality. Extracellular techniques are not, therefore, able to record action potentials with the accuracy needed to explore the properties of ion channels. As a result, the pharmacological screening of ion-channel drugs is usually performed by low-throughput intracellular recording methods. The use of nanowire transistors, nanotube-coupled transistors and micro gold-spine and related electrodes can significantly improve the signal strength of recorded action potentials. Here, we show that vertical nanopillar electrodes can record both the extracellular and intracellular action potentials of cultured cardiomyocytes over a long period of time with excellent signal strength and quality. Moreover, it is possible to repeatedly switch between extracellular and intracellular recording by nanoscale electroporation and resealing processes. Furthermore, vertical nanopillar electrodes can detect subtle changes in action potentials induced by drugs that target ion channels.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Chong Xie', '\xa0&\xa0Yi Cui']}, {'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Ziliang Lin']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Lindsey Hanson', '\xa0&\xa0Bianxiao Cui']}, {'address': 'Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, 2575 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, 94025, California, USA', 'authors': ['Yi Cui']}]",False,"['Chong Xie', 'Ziliang Lin', 'Lindsey Hanson', 'Yi Cui', 'Bianxiao Cui']","Xie, C., Lin, Z., Hanson, L. et al.
