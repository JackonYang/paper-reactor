letter,Imaging the charge distribution within a single molecule,"<p>Scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy can be used to study the electronic and structural properties of surfaces, as well as molecules and nanostructures adsorbed on surfaces, with atomic precision, but they cannot directly probe the distribution of charge in these systems. However, another form of scanning probe microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, can be used to measure the local contact potential difference between the scanning probe tip and the surface, a quantity that is closely related to the charge distribution on the surface. Here, we use a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy, atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy to examine naphthalocyanine molecules (which have been used as molecular switches) on a thin insulating layer of NaCl on Cu(111). We show that Kelvin probe force microscopy can map the local contact potential difference of this system with submolecular resolution, and we use density functional theory calculations to verify that these maps reflect the intramolecular distribution of charge. This approach could help to provide fundamental insights into single-molecule switching and bond formation, processes that are usually accompanied by the redistribution of charge within or between molecules.</p>",[],False,"[""Fabian Mohn"", ""Leo Gross"", ""Nikolaj Moll"", ""Gerhard Meyer""]","Mohn, F., Gross, L., Moll, N. et al.

letter,Tunable doping of a metal with molecular spins,"<p>The mutual interaction of localized magnetic moments and their interplay with itinerant conduction electrons in a solid are central to many phenomena in condensed-matter physics, including magnetic ordering and related many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect, the Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yoshida interaction and carrier-induced ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors. The strength and relative importance of these spin phenomena are determined by the magnitude and sign of the exchange interaction between the localized magnetic moments and also by the mean distance between them. Detailed studies of such systems require the ability to tune the mean distance between the localized magnetic moments, which is equivalent to being able to control the concentration of magnetic impurities in the host material. Here, we present a method for doping a gold film with localized magnetic moments that involves depositing a monolayer of a metal terpyridine complex onto the film. The metal ions in the complexes can be cobalt or zinc, and the concentration of magnetic impurities in the gold film can be controlled by varying the relative amounts of cobalt complexes (which carry a spin) and zinc complexes (which have zero spin). Kondo and weak localization measurements demonstrate that the magnetic impurity concentration can be systematically varied up to &#8764;800 ppm without any sign of inter-impurity interaction. Moreover, we find no evidence for the unwanted clustering that is often produced when using alternative methods.</p>",[],False,"[""T. Gang"", ""M. Deniz Yilmaz"", ""D. Ata\u00e7"", ""S. K.

letter,Quantitative super-resolution imaging uncovers reactivity patterns on single nanocatalysts,"<p>Metal nanoparticles are used as catalysts in a variety of important chemical reactions, and can have a range of different shapes, with facets and sites that differ in catalytic reactivity. To develop better catalysts it is necessary to determine where catalysis occurs on such nanoparticles and what structures are more reactive. Surface science experiments or theory can be used to predict the reactivity of surfaces with a known structure, and the reactivity of nanocatalysts can often be rationalized from a knowledge of their well-defined surface facets. Here, we show that a knowledge of the surface facets of a gold nanorod catalyst is insufficient to predict its reactivity, and we must also consider defects on the surface of the nanorod. We use super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to quantify the catalysis of the nanorods at a temporal resolution of a single catalytic reaction and a spatial resolution of &#8764;40 nm. We find that within the same surface facets on the sides of a single nanorod, the reactivity is not constant and exhibits a gradient from the centre of the nanorod towards its two ends. Furthermore, the ratio of the reactivity at the ends of the nanorod to the reactivity at the sides varies significantly from nanorod to nanorod, even though they all have the same surface facets.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaochun Zhou"", ""Nesha May Andoy"", ""Guokun Liu"", ""Eric Choudhary"", ""Kyu-Sung Han"", ""Hao Shen"", ""Peng Chen""]","Zhou, X., Andoy, N., Liu, G. et al.

letter,A single-atom transistor,"<p>The ability to control matter at the atomic scale and build devices with atomic precision is central to nanotechnology. The scanning tunnelling microscope can manipulate individual atoms and molecules on surfaces, but the manipulation of silicon to make atomic-scale logic circuits has been hampered by the covalent nature of its bonds. Resist-based strategies have allowed the formation of atomic-scale structures on silicon surfaces, but the fabrication of working devices&#8212;such as transistors with extremely short gate lengths, spin-based quantum computers and solitary dopant optoelectronic devices&#8212;requires the ability to position individual atoms in a silicon crystal with atomic precision. Here, we use a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy and hydrogen-resist lithography to demonstrate a single-atom transistor in which an individual phosphorus dopant atom has been deterministically placed within an epitaxial silicon device architecture with a spatial accuracy of one lattice site. The transistor operates at liquid helium temperatures, and millikelvin electron transport measurements confirm the presence of discrete quantum levels in the energy spectrum of the phosphorus atom. We find a charging energy that is close to the bulk value, previously only observed by optical spectroscopy.</p>",[],False,"[""Martin Fuechsle"", ""Jill A.

letter,Electrical control of a solid-state flying qubit,"<p>Solid-state approaches to quantum information technology are attractive because they are scalable. The coherent transport of quantum information over large distances is a requirement for any practical quantum computer and has been demonstrated by coupling super-conducting qubits to photons. Single electrons have also been transferred between distant quantum dots in times shorter than their spin coherence time. However, until now, there have been no demonstrations of scalable &#8216;flying qubit&#8217; architectures&#8212;systems in which it is possible to perform quantum operations on qubits while they are being coherently transferred&#8212;in solid-state systems. These architectures allow for control over qubit separation and for non-local entanglement, which makes them more amenable to integration and scaling than static qubit approaches. Here, we report the transport and manipulation of qubits over distances of 6 &#181;m within 40 ps, in an Aharonov&#8211;Bohm ring connected to two-channel wires that have a tunable tunnel coupling between channels. The flying qubit state is defined by the presence of a travelling electron in either channel of the wire, and can be controlled without a magnetic field. Our device has shorter quantum gates (&lt;1 &#181;m), longer coherence lengths (&#8764;86 &#181;m at 70 mK) and higher operating frequencies (&#8764;100 GHz) than other solid-state implementations of flying qubits.</p>",[],False,"[""Michihisa Yamamoto"", ""Shintaro Takada"", ""Christopher B\u00e4uerle"", ""Kenta Watanabe"", ""Andreas D.

letter,Engineering controllable bidirectional molecular motors based on myosin,"<p>Cytoskeletal motors drive the transport of organelles and molecular cargoes within cells and have potential applications in molecular detection and diagnostic devices. Engineering molecular motors with controllable properties will allow selective perturbation of mechanical processes in living cells and provide optimized device components for tasks such as molecular sorting and directed assembly. Biological motors have previously been modified by introducing activation/deactivation switches that respond to metal ions and other signals. Here, we show that myosin motors can be engineered to reversibly change their direction of motion in response to a calcium signal. Building on previous protein engineering studies and guided by a structural model for the redirected power stroke of myosin VI, we have constructed bidirectional myosins through the rigid recombination of structural modules. The performance of the motors was confirmed using gliding filament assays and single fluorophore tracking. Our strategy, in which external signals trigger changes in the geometry and mechanics of myosin lever arms, should make it possible to achieve spatiotemporal control over a range of motor properties including processivity, stride size and branchpoint turning.</p>",[],False,"[""Lu Chen"", ""Muneaki Nakamura"", ""Tony D.

article,Stochastic sensing of proteins with receptor-modified solid-state nanopores,"<p>Solid-state nanopores are capable of the label-free analysis of single molecules. It is possible to add biochemical selectivity by anchoring a molecular receptor inside the nanopore, but it is difficult to maintain single-molecule sensitivity in these modified nanopores. Here, we show that metallized silicon nitride nanopores chemically modified with nitrilotriacetic acid receptors can be used for the stochastic sensing of proteins. The reversible binding and unbinding of the proteins to the receptors is observed in real time, and the interaction parameters are statistically analysed from single-molecule binding events.

article,Oral exposure to polystyrene nanoparticles affects iron absorption,"<p>The use of engineered nanoparticles in food and pharmaceuticals is expected to increase, but the impact of chronic oral exposure to nanoparticles on human health remains unknown. Here, we show that chronic and acute oral exposure to polystyrene nanoparticles can influence iron uptake and iron transport in an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelium and an in vivo chicken intestinal loop model. Intestinal cells that are exposed to high doses of nanoparticles showed increased iron transport due to nanoparticle disruption of the cell membrane. Chickens acutely exposed to carboxylated particles (50&#160;nm in diameter) had a lower iron absorption than unexposed or chronically exposed birds. Chronic exposure caused remodelling of the intestinal villi, which increased the surface area available for iron absorption. The agreement between the in vitro and in vivo results suggests that our in vitro intestinal epithelium model is potentially useful for toxicology studies.</p>",[],False,"[""Gretchen J.
