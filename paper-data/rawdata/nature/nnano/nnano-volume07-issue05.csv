letter,Real-time single-molecule imaging of quantum interference,"<p>The observation of interference patterns in double-slit experiments with massive particles is generally regarded as the ultimate demonstration of the quantum nature of these objects. Such matter&#8211;wave interference has been observed for electrons, neutrons, atoms and molecules and, in contrast to classical physics, quantum interference can be observed when single particles arrive at the detector one by one. The build-up of such patterns in experiments with electrons has been described as the &#8220;most beautiful experiment in physics&#8221;. Here, we show how a combination of nanofabrication and nano-imaging allows us to record the full two-dimensional build-up of quantum interference patterns in real time for phthalocyanine molecules and for derivatives of phthalocyanine molecules, which have masses of 514&#160;AMU and 1,298&#160;AMU respectively. A laser-controlled micro-evaporation source was used to produce a beam of molecules with the required intensity and coherence, and the gratings were machined in 10-nm-thick silicon nitride membranes to reduce the effect of van der Waals forces. Wide-field fluorescence microscopy detected the position of each molecule with an accuracy of 10&#160;nm and revealed the build-up of a deterministic ensemble interference pattern from single molecules that arrived stochastically at the detector. In addition to providing this particularly clear demonstration of wave&#8211;particle duality, our approach could also be used to study larger molecules and explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics.</p>",[],False,"[""Thomas Juffmann"", ""Adriana Milic"", ""Michael M\u00fcllneritsch"", ""Peter Asenbaum"", ""Alexander Tsukernik"", ""Jens T\u00fcxen"", ""Marcel Mayor"", ""Ori Cheshnovsky"", ""Markus Arndt""]","Juffmann, T., Milic, A., Müllneritsch, M. et al.

letter,A nanomechanical mass sensor with yoctogram resolution,"<p>Nanomechanical resonators have been used to weigh cells, biomolecules and gas molecules, and to study basic phenomena in surface science, such as phase transitions and diffusion. These experiments all rely on the ability of nanomechanical mass sensors to resolve small masses. Here, we report mass sensing experiments with a resolution of 1.7&#160;yg (1&#160;yg&#160;=&#160;10<sup>&#8722;24</sup> g), which corresponds to the mass of one proton. The resonator is a carbon nanotube of length &#8764;150 nm that vibrates at a frequency of almost 2 GHz. This unprecedented level of sensitivity allows us to detect adsorption events of naphthalene molecules (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>), and to measure the binding energy of a xenon atom on the nanotube surface.

letter,Observation of quantum interference in molecular charge transport,"<p>As the dimensions of a conductor approach the nanoscale, quantum effects begin to dominate, and it becomes possible to control the conductance through direct manipulation of the electron wavefunction. Such control has been demonstrated in various mesoscopic devices at cryogenic temperatures, but it has proved to be difficult to exert control over the wavefunction at higher temperatures. Molecules have typical energy level spacings (&#8764;eV) that are much larger than the thermal energy at 300 K (&#8764;25 meV), and are therefore natural candidates for such experiments. Previously, phenomena such as giant magnetoresistance, Kondo effects and conductance switching have been observed in single molecules, and theorists have predicted that it should also be possible to observe quantum interference in molecular conductors, but until now all the evidence for such behaviour has been indirect. Here, we report the observation of destructive quantum interference in charge transport through two-terminal molecular junctions at room temperature. We studied five different rigid &#960;-conjugated molecular wires, all of which form self-assembled monolayers on a gold surface, and find that the degree of interference can be controlled by simple chemical modifications of the molecular wire.</p>",[],False,"[""Constant M.

letter,Stable cycling of double-walled silicon nanotube battery anodes through solid–electrolyte interphase control,"<p>Although the performance of lithium ion-batteries continues to improve, their energy density and cycle life remain insufficient for applications in consumer electronics, transport and large-scale renewable energy storage. Silicon has a large charge storage capacity and this makes it an attractive anode material, but pulverization during cycling and an unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase has limited the cycle life of silicon anodes to hundreds of cycles. Here, we show that anodes consisting of an active silicon nanotube surrounded by an ion-permeable silicon oxide shell can cycle over 6,000 times in half cells while retaining more than 85% of their initial capacity. The outer surface of the silicon nanotube is prevented from expansion by the oxide shell, and the expanding inner surface is not exposed to the electrolyte, resulting in a stable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase. Batteries containing these double-walled silicon nanotube anodes exhibit charge capacities approximately eight times larger than conventional carbon anodes and charging rates of up to 20C (a rate of 1C corresponds to complete charge or discharge in one hour).</p>",[],False,"[""Hui Wu"", ""Gerentt Chan"", ""Jang Wook Choi"", ""Ill Ryu"", ""Yan Yao"", ""Matthew T.

letter,Remote Joule heating by a carbon nanotube,"<p>Minimizing Joule heating remains an important goal in the design of electronic devices. The prevailing model of Joule heating relies on a simple semiclassical picture in which electrons collide with the atoms of a conductor, generating heat locally and only in regions of non-zero current density, and this model has been supported by most experiments. Recently, however, it has been predicted that electric currents in graphene and carbon nanotubes can couple to the vibrational modes of a neighbouring material, heating it remotely. Here, we use in situ electron thermal microscopy to detect the remote Joule heating of a silicon nitride substrate by a single multiwalled carbon nanotube. At least 84% of the electrical power supplied to the nanotube is dissipated directly into the substrate, rather than in the nanotube itself. Although it has different physical origins, this phenomenon is reminiscent of induction heating or microwave dielectric heating. Such an ability to dissipate waste energy remotely could lead to improved thermal management in electronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Kamal H.

letter,A robust scanning diamond sensor for nanoscale imaging with single nitrogen-vacancy centres,"<p>The nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond has potential applications in nanoscale electric and magnetic-field sensing, single-photon microscopy, quantum information processing and bioimaging. These applications rely on the ability to position a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within a few nanometres of a sample, and then scan it across the sample surface, while preserving the centre's spin coherence and readout fidelity. However, existing scanning techniques, which use a single diamond nanocrystal grafted onto the tip of a scanning probe microscope, suffer from short spin coherence times due to poor crystal quality, and from inefficient far-field collection of the fluorescence from the nitrogen-vacancy centre. Here, we demonstrate a robust method for scanning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within tens of nanometres from a sample surface that addresses both of these concerns. This is achieved by positioning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre at the end of a high-purity diamond nanopillar, which we use as the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our approach ensures long nitrogen-vacancy spin coherence times (&#8764;75 &#181;s), enhanced nitrogen-vacancy collection efficiencies due to waveguiding, and mechanical robustness of the device (several weeks of scanning time). We are able to image magnetic domains with widths of 25 nm, and demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of 56 nT Hz<sup>&#8211;1/2</sup> at a frequency of 33&#160;kHz, which is unprecedented for scanning nitrogen-vacancy centres.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

letter,An atlas of carbon nanotube optical transitions,"<p>Electron&#8211;electron interactions are significantly enhanced in one-dimensional systems, and single-walled carbon nanotubes provide a unique opportunity for studying such interactions and the related many-body effects in one dimension. However, single-walled nanotubes can have a wide range of diameters and hundreds of different structures, each defined by its chiral index (n,m), where n and m are integers that can have values from zero up to 30 or more. Moreover, one-third of these structures are metals and two-thirds are semiconductors, and they display optical resonances at many different frequencies. Systematic studies of many-body effects in nanotubes would therefore benefit from the availability of a technique for identifying the chiral index of a nanotube based on a measurement of its optical resonances, and vice versa. Here, we report the establishment of a structure&#8211;property &#8216;atlas&#8217; for nanotube optical transitions based on simultaneous electron diffraction measurements of the chiral index and Rayleigh scattering measurements of the optical resonances of 206 different single-walled nanotube structures. The nanotubes, which were suspended across open slit structures on silicon substrates, had diameters in the range 1.3&#8211;4.7&#160;nm. We also use this atlas as a starting point for a systematic study of many-body effects in the excited states of single-walled nanotubes. We find that electron&#8211;electron interactions shift the optical resonance energies by the same amount for both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, and that this shift (which corresponds to an effective Fermi velocity renormalization) increases monotonically with nanotube diameter. This behaviour arises from two sources: an intriguing cancellation of long-range electron&#8211;electron interaction effects, and the dependence of short-range electron&#8211;electron interactions on diameter.</p>",[],False,"[""Kaihui Liu"", ""Jack Deslippe"", ""Fajun Xiao"", ""Rodrigo B.

letter,Tunable infrared plasmonic devices using graphene/insulator stacks,"<p>The collective oscillation of carriers&#8212;the plasmon&#8212;in graphene has many desirable properties, including tunability and low loss. However, in single-layer graphene, the dependence on carrier concentration of both the plasmonic resonance frequency and magnitude is relatively weak, limiting its applications in photonics. Here, we demonstrate transparent photonic devices based on graphene/insulator stacks, which are formed by depositing alternating wafer-scale graphene sheets and thin insulating layers, then patterning them together into photonic-crystal-like structures. We show experimentally that the plasmon in such stacks is unambiguously non-classical. Compared with doping in single-layer graphene, distributing carriers into multiple graphene layers effectively enhances the plasmonic resonance frequency and magnitude, which is different from the effect in a conventional semiconductor superlattice and is a direct consequence of the unique carrier density scaling law of the plasmonic resonance of Dirac fermions. Using patterned graphene/insulator stacks, we demonstrate widely tunable far-infrared notch filters with 8.2&#160;dB rejection ratios and terahertz linear polarizers with 9.5&#160;dB extinction ratios. An unpatterned stack consisting of five graphene layers shields 97.5% of electromagnetic radiation at frequencies below 1.2&#160;THz.

letter,"Red, green and blue lasing enabled by single-exciton gain in colloidal quantum dot films","<p>Colloidal quantum dots exhibit efficient photoluminescence with widely tunable bandgaps as a result of quantum confinement effects. Such quantum dots are emerging as an appealing complement to epitaxial semiconductor laser materials, which are ubiquitous and technologically mature, but unable to cover the full visible spectrum (red, green and blue; RGB). However, the requirement for high colloidal-quantum-dot packing density, and losses due to non-radiative multiexcitonic Auger recombination, have hindered the development of lasers based on colloidal quantum dots. Here, we engineer CdSe/ZnCdS core/shell colloidal quantum dots with aromatic ligands, which form densely packed films exhibiting optical gain across the visible spectrum with less than one exciton per colloidal quantum dot on average. This single-exciton gain allows the films to reach the threshold of amplified spontaneous emission at very low optical pump energy densities of 90&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup>, more than one order of magnitude better than previously reported values.
