letter,Virus-based piezoelectric energy generation,"<p>Piezoelectric materials can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, and piezoelectric devices made of a variety of inorganic materials and organic polymers have been demonstrated. However, synthesizing such materials often requires toxic starting compounds, harsh conditions and/or complex procedures. Previously, it was shown that hierarchically organized natural materials such as bones, collagen fibrils and peptide nanotubes can display piezoelectric properties. Here, we demonstrate that the piezoelectric and liquid-crystalline properties of M13 bacteriophage (phage) can be used to generate electrical energy. Using piezoresponse force microscopy, we characterize the structure-dependent piezoelectric properties of the phage at the molecular level. We then show that self-assembled thin films of phage can exhibit piezoelectric strengths of up to 7.8&#160;pm&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. We also demonstrate that it is possible to modulate the dipole strength of the phage, hence tuning the piezoelectric response, by genetically engineering the major coat proteins of the phage. Finally, we develop a phage-based piezoelectric generator that produces up to 6&#160;nA of current and 400&#160;mV of potential and use it to operate a liquid-crystal display. Because biotechnology techniques enable large-scale production of genetically modified phages, phage-based piezoelectric materials potentially offer a simple and environmentally friendly approach to piezoelectric energy generation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA', 'authors': ['Byung Yang Lee', ',\xa0Woo-Jae Chung', ',\xa0So Young Yoo', ',\xa0Eddie Wang', ',\xa0Joel Meyer', '\xa0&\xa0Seung-Wuk Lee']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA', 'authors': ['Jinxing Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Ramamoorthy Ramesh']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA', 'authors': ['Chris Zueger']}, {'address': 'Physical Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Byung Yang Lee', ',\xa0Chris Zueger', ',\xa0Woo-Jae Chung', ',\xa0So Young Yoo', ',\xa0Eddie Wang', ',\xa0Joel Meyer', '\xa0&\xa0Seung-Wuk Lee']}, {'address': 'Materials Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Jinxing Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Ramamoorthy Ramesh']}]",False,"['Byung Yang Lee', 'Jinxing Zhang', 'Chris Zueger', 'Woo-Jae Chung', 'So Young Yoo', 'Eddie Wang', 'Joel Meyer', 'Ramamoorthy Ramesh', 'Seung-Wuk Lee']","Lee, B., Zhang, J., Zueger, C. et al.

letter,Hydrogen stabilization of metallic vanadium dioxide in single-crystal nanobeams,"<p>Vanadium dioxide is a strongly correlated material that undergoes a metal&#8211;insulator transition from a high-temperature, rutile metal to a monoclinic insulating state at 67&#160;&#176;C. In recent years, experiments on single-crystal vanadium-dioxide nanowires grown by physical vapour deposition have shed light on the crucial role of strain in the structural and electronic phase diagram of this material, including evidence for a new M2 phase, but the detailed physics of this material is still not fully understood. The transition temperature can be reduced by doping with tungsten, but this process is not reversible. Here, we show that the metal&#8211;insulator transition in nanoscale beams of vanadium dioxide can be strongly modified by doping with atomic hydrogen using the catalytic spillover method. We also show that this process is completely reversible, and that the metal&#8211;insulator transition eventually vanishes when the doping exceeds a threshold value. Raman and conventional optical microscopy, electron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy provide evidence that the structure of the metallic post-hydrogenation state is similar to that of the rutile state. First-principles electronic structure calculations confirm that a distorted rutile structure is energetically favoured following hydrogenation, and also that such doping favours metallicity from both the Mott and Peierls perspectives. We anticipate that hydrogen doping will be a powerful tool for examining the metal&#8211;insulator transition and for engineering the properties of vanadium dioxide.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, 77005, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Jiang Wei', ',\xa0Heng Ji', ',\xa0Andriy H.

letter,Hybrid graphene–quantum dot phototransistors with ultrahigh gain,"<p>Graphene is an attractive material for optoelectronics and photodetection applications because it offers a broad spectral bandwidth and fast response times. However, weak light absorption and the absence of a gain mechanism that can generate multiple charge carriers from one incident photon have limited the responsivity of graphene-based photodetectors to &#8764;10<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#160;A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Here, we demonstrate a gain of &#8764;10<sup>8</sup> electrons per photon and a responsivity of &#8764;10<sup>7</sup>&#160;A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in a hybrid photodetector that consists of monolayer or bilayer graphene covered with a thin film of colloidal quantum dots. Strong and tunable light absorption in the quantum-dot layer creates electric charges that are transferred to the graphene, where they recirculate many times due to the high charge mobility of graphene and long trapped-charge lifetimes in the quantum-dot layer. The device, with a specific detectivity of 7&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>13</sup> Jones, benefits from gate-tunable sensitivity and speed, spectral selectivity from the short-wavelength infrared to the visible, and compatibility with current circuit technologies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ICFO — Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, Castelldefels, 08860, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Gerasimos Konstantatos', ',\xa0Michela Badioli', ',\xa0Louis Gaudreau', ',\xa0Johann Osmond', ',\xa0Maria Bernechea', ',\xa0F.

letter,Bright infrared quantum-dot light-emitting diodes through inter-dot spacing control,"<p>Infrared light-emitting diodes are currently fabricated from direct-gap semiconductors using epitaxy, which makes them expensive and difficult to integrate with other materials. Light-emitting diodes based on colloidal semiconductor quantum dots, on the other hand, can be solution-processed at low cost, and can be directly integrated with silicon. However, so far, exciton dissociation and recombination have not been well controlled in these devices, and this has limited their performance. Here, by tuning the distance between adjacent PbS quantum dots, we fabricate thin-film quantum-dot light-emitting diodes that operate at infrared wavelengths with radiances (6.4&#160;W&#160;sr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) eight times higher and external quantum efficiencies (2.0%) two times higher than the highest values previously reported. The distance between adjacent dots is tuned over a range of 1.3&#160;nm by varying the lengths of the linker molecules from three to eight CH<sub>2</sub> groups, which allows us to achieve the optimum balance between charge injection and radiative exciton recombination. The electroluminescent powers of the best devices are comparable to those produced by commercial InGaAsP light-emitting diodes. By varying the size of the quantum dots, we can tune the emission wavelengths between 800 and 1,850&#160;nm.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Liangfeng Sun', ',\xa0Joshua J.

letter,Cell-free protein synthesis and assembly on a biochip,"<p>Biologically active complexes such as ribosomes and bacteriophages are formed through the self-assembly of proteins and nucleic acids. Recapitulating these biological self-assembly processes in a cell-free environment offers a way to develop synthetic biodevices. To visualize and understand the assembly process, a platform is required that enables simultaneous synthesis, assembly and imaging at the nanoscale. Here, we show that a silicon dioxide grid, used to support samples in transmission electron microscopy, can be modified into a biochip to combine in situ protein synthesis, assembly and imaging. Light is used to pattern the biochip surface with genes that encode specific proteins, and antibody traps that bind and assemble the nascent proteins. Using transmission electron microscopy imaging we show that protein nanotubes synthesized on the biochip surface in the presence of antibody traps efficiently assembled on these traps, but pre-assembled nanotubes were not effectively captured. Moreover, synthesis of green fluorescent protein from its immobilized gene generated a gradient of captured proteins decreasing in concentration away from the gene source. This biochip could be used to create spatial patterns of proteins assembled on surfaces.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials and Interfaces, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel', 'authors': ['Yael Heyman', ',\xa0Amnon Buxboim', ',\xa0Shirley S.

letter,Optical detection of single non-absorbing molecules using the surface plasmon resonance of a gold nanorod,"<p>Existing methods for the optical detection of single molecules require the molecules to absorb light to produce fluorescence or direct absorption signals. This limits the range of species that can be detected, because most molecules are purely refractive. Metal nanoparticles or dielectric resonators can be used to detect non-absorbing molecules because local changes in the refractive index produce a resonance shift. However, current approaches only detect single molecules when the resonance shift is amplified by a highly polarizable label or by a localized precipitation reaction on the surface of a nanoparticle. Without such amplification, single-molecule events can only be identified in a statistical way. Here, we report the plasmonic detection of single molecules in real time without the need for labelling or amplification. Our sensor consists of a single gold nanorod coated with biotin receptors, and the binding of single proteins is detected by monitoring the plasmon resonance of the nanorod with a sensitive photothermal assay. The sensitivity of our device is &#8764;700 times higher than state-of-the-art plasmon sensors and is intrinsically limited by spectral diffusion of the surface plasmon resonance.</p>",,"[{'address': 'MoNOS Huygens Laboratorium, Universiteit Leiden, Leiden, 2300 RA, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Peter Zijlstra', '\xa0&\xa0Michel Orrit']}, {'address': 'Centro de Química Estrutural – Complexo I, Instituto Superior Técnico, Av.

letter,Normalization of tumour blood vessels improves the delivery of nanomedicines in a size-dependent manner,"<p>The blood vessels of cancerous tumours are leaky and poorly organized. This can increase the interstitial fluid pressure inside tumours and reduce blood supply to them, which impairs drug delivery. Anti-angiogenic therapies&#8212;which &#8216;normalize&#8217; the abnormal blood vessels in tumours by making them less leaky&#8212;have been shown to improve the delivery and effectiveness of chemotherapeutics with low molecular weights, but it remains unclear whether normalizing tumour vessels can improve the delivery of nanomedicines. Here, we show that repairing the abnormal vessels in mammary tumours, by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, improves the delivery of smaller nanoparticles (diameter, 12 nm) while hindering the delivery of larger nanoparticles (diameter, 125 nm). Using a mathematical model, we show that reducing the sizes of pores in the walls of vessels through normalization decreases the interstitial fluid pressure in tumours, thus allowing small nanoparticles to enter them more rapidly. However, increased steric and hydrodynamic hindrances, also associated with smaller pores, make it more difficult for large nanoparticles to enter tumours. Our results further suggest that smaller (&#8764;12 nm) nanomedicines are ideal for cancer therapy due to their superior tumour penetration.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Edwin L.

letter,Molecularly self-assembled nucleic acid nanoparticles for targeted in vivo siRNA delivery,"<p>Nanoparticles are used for delivering therapeutics into cells. However, size, shape, surface chemistry and the presentation of targeting ligands on the surface of nanoparticles can affect circulation half-life and biodistribution, cell-specific internalization, excretion, toxicity and efficacy. A variety of materials have been explored for delivering small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)&#8212;a therapeutic agent that suppresses the expression of targeted genes. However, conventional delivery nanoparticles such as liposomes and polymeric systems are heterogeneous in size, composition and surface chemistry, and this can lead to suboptimal performance, a lack of tissue specificity and potential toxicity. Here, we show that self-assembled DNA tetrahedral nanoparticles with a well-defined size can deliver siRNAs into cells and silence target genes in tumours. Monodisperse nanoparticles are prepared through the self-assembly of complementary DNA strands. Because the DNA strands are easily programmable, the size of the nanoparticles and the spatial orientation and density of cancer-targeting ligands (such as peptides and folate) on the nanoparticle surface can be controlled precisely. We show that at least three folate molecules per nanoparticle are required for optimal delivery of the siRNAs into cells and, gene silencing occurs only when the ligands are in the appropriate spatial orientation. In vivo, these nanoparticles showed a longer blood circulation time (t<sub>1/2</sub>&#160;&#8776;&#160;24.2&#160;min) than the parent siRNA (t<sub>1/2</sub>&#160;&#8776;&#160;6&#160;min).</p>",,"[{'address': 'David H.

article,An oxygen reduction electrocatalyst based on carbon nanotube–graphene complexes,"<p>Oxygen reduction reaction catalysts based on precious metals such as platinum or its alloys are routinely used in fuel cells because of their high activity. Carbon-supported materials containing metals such as iron or cobalt as well as nitrogen impurities have been proposed to increase scalability and reduce costs, but these alternatives usually suffer from low activity and/or gradual deactivation during use. Here, we show that few-walled carbon nanotubes, following outer wall exfoliation via oxidation and high-temperature reaction with ammonia, can act as an oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Under a unique oxidation condition, the outer walls of the few-walled carbon nanotubes are partially unzipped, creating nanoscale sheets of graphene attached to the inner tubes. The graphene sheets contain extremely small amounts of irons originated from nanotube growth seeds, and nitrogen impurities, which facilitate the formation of catalytic sites and boost the activity of the catalyst, as revealed by atomic-scale microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Whereas the graphene sheets formed from the unzipped part of the outer wall of the nanotubes are responsible for the catalytic activity, the inner walls remain intact and retain their electrical conductivity, which facilitates charge transport during electrocatalysis.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Yanguang Li', ',\xa0Hailiang Wang', ',\xa0Liming Xie', ',\xa0Yongye Liang', '\xa0&\xa0Hongjie Dai']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, 37235, Tennessee, USA', 'authors': ['Wu Zhou', ',\xa0Juan-Carlos Idrobo', '\xa0&\xa0Stephen J.

article,Quantification of the affinities and kinetics of protein interactions using silicon nanowire biosensors,"<p>Monitoring the binding affinities and kinetics of protein interactions is important in clinical diagnostics and drug development because such information is used to identify new therapeutic candidates. Surface plasmon resonance is at present the standard method used for such analysis, but this is limited by low sensitivity and low-throughput analysis. Here, we show that silicon nanowire field-effect transistors can be used as biosensors to measure protein&#8211;ligand binding affinities and kinetics with sensitivities down to femtomolar concentrations. Based on this sensing mechanism, we develop an analytical model to calibrate the sensor response and quantify the molecular binding affinities of two representative protein&#8211;ligand binding pairs. The rate constant of the association and dissociation of the protein&#8211;ligand pair is determined by monitoring the reaction kinetics, demonstrating that silicon nanowire field-effect transistors can be readily used as high-throughput biosensors to quantify protein interactions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, 06520, Connecticut, USA', 'authors': ['Xuexin Duan', ',\xa0David A.
