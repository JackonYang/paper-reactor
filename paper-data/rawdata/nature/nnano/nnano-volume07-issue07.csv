letter,Biodegradable nanocomposites of amyloid fibrils and graphene with shape-memory and enzyme-sensing properties,"<p>Graphene has exceptional mechanical and electronic properties, but its hydrophobic nature is a disadvantage in biologically related applications. Amyloid fibrils are naturally occurring protein aggregates that are stable in solution or under highly hydrated conditions, have well-organized supramolecular structures and outstanding strength. Here, we show that graphene and amyloid fibrils can be combined to create a new class of biodegradable composite materials with adaptable properties. This new composite material is inexpensive, highly conductive and can be degraded by enzymes. Furthermore, it can reversibly change shape in response to variations in humidity, and can be used in the design of biosensors for quantifying the activity of enzymes. The properties of the composite can be fine-tuned by changing the graphene-to-amyloid ratio.</p>",[],False,"[""Chaoxu Li"", ""Jozef Adamcik"", ""Raffaele Mezzenga""]","Li, C., Adamcik, J. & Mezzenga, R.

letter,Protein–inorganic hybrid nanoflowers,"<p>Flower-shaped inorganic nanocrystals have been used for applications in catalysis and analytical science, but so far there have been no reports of &#8216;nanoflowers&#8217; made of organic components. Here, we report a method for creating hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic nanoflowers using copper (II) ions as the inorganic component and various proteins as the organic component. The protein molecules form complexes with the copper ions, and these complexes become nucleation sites for primary crystals of copper phosphate. Interaction between the protein and copper ions then leads to the growth of micrometre-sized particles that have nanoscale features and that are shaped like flower petals. When an enzyme is used as the protein component of the hybrid nanoflower, it exhibits enhanced enzymatic activity and stability compared with the free enzyme. This is attributed to the high surface area and confinement of the enzymes in the nanoflowers.</p>",[],False,"[""Jun Ge"", ""Jiandu Lei"", ""Richard N. Zare""]","Ge, J., Lei, J. & Zare, R.

letter,Self-orienting nanocubes for the assembly of plasmonic nanojunctions,"<p>Plasmonic hot spots are formed when metal surfaces with high curvature are separated by nanoscale gaps and an electromagnetic field is localized within the gaps. These hot spots are responsible for phenomena such as subwavelength focusing, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electromagnetic transparency, and depend on the geometry of the nanojunctions between the metal surfaces. Direct-write techniques such as electron-beam lithography can create complex nanostructures with impressive spatial control but struggle to fabricate gaps on the order of a few nanometres or manufacture arrays of nanojunctions in a scalable manner. Self-assembly methods, in contrast, can be carried out on a massively parallel scale using metal nanoparticle building blocks of specific shape. Here, we show that polymer-grafted metal nanocubes can be self-assembled into arrays of one-dimensional strings that have well-defined interparticle orientations and tunable electromagnetic properties. The nanocubes are assembled within a polymer thin film and we observe unique superstructures derived from edge&#8211;edge or face&#8211;face interactions between the nanocubes. The assembly process is strongly dependent on parameters such as polymer chain length, rigidity or grafting density, and can be predicted by free energy calculations.</p>",[],False,"[""Bo Gao"", ""Gaurav Arya"", ""Andrea R.

letter,Flexible molecular-scale electronic devices,"<p>Flexible materials and devices could be exploited in light-emitting diodes, electronic circuits, memory devices, sensors, displays, solar cells and bioelectronic devices. Nanoscale elements such as thin films, nanowires, nanotubes and nanoparticles can also be incorporated into the active films of mechanically flexible devices. Large-area devices containing extremely thin films of molecular materials represent the ultimate scaling of flexible devices based on organic materials, but the influence of bending and twisting on the electrical and mechanical stability of such devices has never been examined. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of two-terminal electronic devices based on self-assembled monolayers of alkyl or aromatic thiol molecules on flexible substrates. We find that the charge transport characteristics of the devices remain stable under severe bending conditions (radius&#160;&#8804;&#160;1&#160;mm) and a large number of repetitive bending cycles (&#8805;1,000).

letter,Anderson–Mott transition in arrays of a few dopant atoms in a silicon transistor,"<p>Dopant atoms are used to control the properties of semiconductors in most electronic devices. Recent advances such as single-ion implantation have allowed the precise positioning of single dopants in semiconductors as well as the fabrication of single-atom transistors, representing steps forward in the realization of quantum circuits. However, the interactions between dopant atoms have only been studied in systems containing large numbers of dopants, so it has not been possible to explore fundamental phenomena such as the Anderson&#8211;Mott transition between conduction by sequential tunnelling through isolated dopant atoms, and conduction through thermally activated impurity Hubbard bands. Here, we observe the Anderson&#8211;Mott transition at low temperatures in silicon transistors containing arrays of two, four or six arsenic dopant atoms that have been deterministically implanted along the channel of the device. The transition is induced by controlling the spacing between dopant atoms. Furthermore, at the critical density between tunnelling and band transport regimes, we are able to change the phase of the electron system from a frozen Wigner-like phase to a Fermi glass by increasing the temperature. Our results open up new approaches for the investigation of coherent transport, band engineering and strongly correlated systems in condensed-matter physics.</p>",[],False,"[""Enrico Prati"", ""Masahiro Hori"", ""Filippo Guagliardo"", ""Giorgio Ferrari"", ""Takahiro Shinada""]","Prati, E., Hori, M., Guagliardo, F. et al.

letter,Measuring the size and charge of single nanoscale objects in solution using an electrostatic fluidic trap,"<p>Measuring the size and charge of objects suspended in solution, such as dispersions of colloids or macromolecules, is a significant challenge. Measurements based on light scattering are inherently biased to larger entities, such as aggregates in the sample, because the intensity of light scattered by a small object scales as the sixth power of its size. Techniques that rely on the collective migration of species in response to external fields (electric or hydrodynamic, for example) are beset with difficulties including low accuracy and dispersion-limited resolution. Here, we show that the size and charge of single nanoscale objects can be directly measured with high throughput by analysing their thermal motion in an array of electrostatic traps. The approach, which is analogous to Millikan's oil drop experiment, could in future be used to detect molecular binding events with high sensitivity or carry out dynamic single-charge resolved measurements at the solid/liquid interface.</p>",[],False,"[""Nassiredin Mojarad"", ""Madhavi Krishnan""]","Mojarad, N., Krishnan, M.

letter,A pilot study in non-human primates shows no adverse response to intravenous injection of quantum dots,"<p>Quantum dots have been used in biomedical research for imaging, diagnostics and sensing purposes. However, concerns over the cytotoxicity of their heavy metal constituents and conflicting results from in vitro and small animal toxicity studies have limited their translation towards clinical applications. Here, we show in a pilot study that rhesus macaques injected with phospholipid micelle-encapsulated CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots do not exhibit evidence of toxicity. Blood and biochemical markers remained within normal ranges following treatment, and histology of major organs after 90&#160;days showed no abnormalities. Our results show that acute toxicity of these quantum dots in vivo can be minimal. However, chemical analysis revealed that most of the initial dose of cadmium remained in the liver, spleen and kidneys after 90&#160;days. This means that the breakdown and clearance of quantum dots is quite slow, suggesting that longer-term studies will be required to determine the ultimate fate of these heavy metals and the impact of their persistence in primates.</p>",[],False,"[""Ling Ye"", ""Ken-Tye Yong"", ""Liwei Liu"", ""Indrajit Roy"", ""Rui Hu"", ""Jing Zhu"", ""Hongxing Cai"", ""Wing-Cheung Law"", ""Jianwei Liu"", ""Kai Wang"", ""Jing Liu"", ""Yaqian Liu"", ""Yazhuo Hu"", ""Xihe Zhang"", ""Mark T.

letter,Magnetoferritin nanoparticles for targeting and visualizing tumour tissues,"<p>Engineered nanoparticles have been used to provide diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic information about the status of disease. Nanoparticles developed for these purposes are typically modified with targeting ligands (such as antibodies, peptides or small molecules) or contrast agents using complicated processes and expensive reagents. Moreover, this approach can lead to an excess of ligands on the nanoparticle surface, and this causes non-specific binding and aggregation of nanoparticles, which decreases detection sensitivity. Here, we show that magnetoferritin nanoparticles (M-HFn) can be used to target and visualize tumour tissues without the use of any targeting ligands or contrast agents. Iron oxide nanoparticles are encapsulated inside a recombinant human heavy-chain ferritin (HFn) protein shell, which binds to tumour cells that overexpress transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). The iron oxide core catalyses the oxidation of peroxidase substrates in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to produce a colour reaction that is used to visualize tumour tissues. We examined 474 clinical specimens from patients with nine types of cancer and verified that these nanoparticles can distinguish cancerous cells from normal cells with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 95%.</p>",[],False,"[""Kelong Fan"", ""Changqian Cao"", ""Yongxin Pan"", ""Di Lu"", ""Dongling Yang"", ""Jing Feng"", ""Lina Song"", ""Minmin Liang"", ""Xiyun Yan""]","Fan, K., Cao, C., Pan, Y. et al.

article,Emissive ZnO–graphene quantum dots for white-light-emitting diodes,"<p>Hybrid nanostructures combining inorganic materials and graphene are being developed for applications such as fuel cells, batteries, photovoltaics and sensors. However, the absence of a bandgap in graphene has restricted the electrical and optical characteristics of these hybrids, particularly their emissive properties. Here, we use a simple solution method to prepare emissive hybrid quantum dots consisting of a ZnO core wrapped in a shell of single-layer graphene. We then use these quantum dots to make a white-light-emitting diode with a brightness of 798&#160;cd&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. The strain introduced by curvature opens an electronic bandgap of 250&#160;meV in the graphene, and two additional blue emission peaks are observed in the luminescent spectrum of the quantum dot. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these additional peaks result from a splitting of the lowest unoccupied orbitals of the graphene into three orbitals with distinct energy levels.
