letter,Valley polarization in MoS2 monolayers by optical pumping,"<p>Most electronic devices exploit the electric charge of electrons, but it is also possible to build devices that rely on other properties of electrons. Spintronic devices, for example, make use of the spin of electrons. Valleytronics is a more recent development that relies on the fact that the conduction bands of some materials have two or more minima at equal energies but at different positions in momentum space. To make a valleytronic device it is necessary to control the number of electrons in these valleys, thereby producing a valley polarization. Single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> is a promising material for valleytronics because both the conduction and valence band edges have two energy-degenerate valleys at the corners of the first Brillouin zone. Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve a valley polarization of 30% in pristine monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>. Our results, and similar results by Mak et al., demonstrate the viability of optical valley control and valley-based electronic and optoelectronic applications in MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayers.</p>",[],False,"[""Hualing Zeng"", ""Junfeng Dai"", ""Wang Yao"", ""Di Xiao"", ""Xiaodong Cui""]","Zeng, H., Dai, J., Yao, W. et al.

letter,Control of valley polarization in monolayer MoS2 by optical helicity,"<p>Electronic and spintronic devices rely on the fact that free charge carriers in solids carry electric charge and spin. There are, however, other properties of charge carriers that might be exploited in new families of devices. In particular, if there are two or more minima in the conduction band (or maxima in the valence band) in momentum space, and if it is possible to confine charge carriers in one of these valleys, then it should be possible to make a valleytronic device. Valley polarization, as the selective population of one valley is designated, has been demonstrated using strain and magnetic fields, but neither of these approaches allows dynamic control. Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve complete dynamic valley polarization in monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> (refs&#160;), a two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric crystal with direct energy gaps at two valleys. Moreover, this polarization is retained for longer than 1&#160;ns.

letter,Shift registers based on magnetic domain wall ratchets with perpendicular anisotropy,"<p>The movement of magnetic domain walls can be used to build a device known as a shift register, which has applications in memory and logic circuits. However, the application of magnetic domain wall shift registers has been hindered by geometrical restrictions, by randomness in domain wall displacement and by the need for high current densities or rotating magnetic fields. Here, we propose a new approach in which the energy landscape experienced by the domain walls is engineered to favour a unidirectional ratchet-like propagation. The domain walls are defined between domains with an out-of-plane (perpendicular) magnetization, which allows us to route domain walls along arbitrary in-plane paths using a time-varying applied magnetic field with fixed orientation. In addition, this ratchet-like motion causes the domain walls to lock to discrete positions along these paths, which is useful for digital devices. As a proof-of-principle experiment we demonstrate the continuous propagation of two domain walls along a closed-loop path in a platinum/cobalt/platinum strip.</p>",[],False,"[""J. H. Franken"", ""H.

letter,Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor with a vacuum channel,"<p>High-speed electronic devices rely on short carrier transport times, which are usually achieved by decreasing the channel length and/or increasing the carrier velocity. Ideally, the carriers enter into a ballistic transport regime in which they are not scattered. However, it is difficult to achieve ballistic transport in a solid-state medium because the high electric fields used to increase the carrier velocity also increase scattering. Vacuum is an ideal medium for ballistic transport, but vacuum electronic devices commonly suffer from low emission currents and high operating voltages. Here, we report the fabrication of a low-voltage field-effect transistor with a vertical vacuum channel (channel length of &#8764;20 nm) etched into a metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor substrate. We measure a transconductance of 20 nS &#181;m<sup>&#8211;1</sup>, an on/off ratio of 500 and a turn-on gate voltage of 0.5&#160;V under ambient conditions. Coulombic repulsion in the two-dimensional electron system at the interface between the oxide and the metal or the semiconductor reduces the energy barrier to electron emission, leading to a high emission current density (&#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>&#160;A&#160;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup>) under a bias of only 1&#160;V. The emission of two-dimensional electron systems into vacuum channels could enable a new class of low-power, high-speed transistors.</p>",[],False,"[""Siwapon Srisonphan"", ""Yun Suk Jung"", ""Hong Koo Kim""]","Srisonphan, S., Jung, Y. & Kim, H.

letter,A hybrid on-chip optomechanical transducer for ultrasensitive force measurements,"<p>Nanoscale mechanical oscillators are used as ultrasensitive detectors of force, mass and charge. Nanomechanical oscillators have also been coupled with optical and electronic resonators to explore the quantum properties of mechanical systems. Here, we report an optomechanical transducer in which a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> nanomechanical beam is coupled to a disk-shaped optical resonator made of silica on a single chip. We demonstrate a force sensitivity of 74&#160;aN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> at room temperature with a readout stability better than 1% at the minute scale. Our system is particularly suited for the detection of very weak incoherent forces, which is difficult with existing approaches because the force resolution scales with the fourth root of the averaging time. By applying dissipative feedback based on radiation pressure, we significantly relax this constraint and are able to detect an incoherent force with a force spectral density of just 15&#160;aN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> (which is 25 times less than the thermal noise) within 35&#160;s of averaging time (which is 30 times less than the averaging time that would be needed in the absence of feedback). It is envisaged that our hybrid on-chip transducer could improve the performance of various forms of force microscopy.</p>",[],False,"[""E. Gavartin"", ""P. Verlot"", ""T. J.

letter,Dispersion forces between ultracold atoms and a carbon nanotube,"<p>Dispersion forces are long-range interactions between polarizable objects that arise from fluctuations in the electromagnetic field between them. Dispersion forces have been observed between microscopic objects such as atoms and molecules (the van der Waals interaction), between macroscopic objects (the Casimir interaction) and between an atom and a macroscopic object (the Casimir&#8211;Polder interaction). Dispersion forces are known to increase the attractive forces between the components in nanomechanical devices, to influence adsorption rates onto nanostructures, and to influence the interactions between biomolecules in biological systems. In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying dispersion forces in nanoscale systems and in exploring the interactions between carbon nanotubes and cold atoms. However, there are considerable difficulties in developing dispersion force theories for general, finite geometries such as nanostructures. Thus, there is a need for new experimental methods that are able to go beyond measurements of planar surfaces and nanoscale gratings and make measurements on isolated nanostructures. Here, we measure the dispersion force between a rubidium atom and a multiwalled carbon nanotube by inserting the nanotube into a cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms and monitoring the loss of atoms from the cloud as a function of time. We perform these experiments with both thermal clouds of ultracold atoms and with Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates. The results obtained with this approach will aid the development of theories describing quantum fields near nanostructures, and hybrid cold-atom/solid-state devices may also prove useful for applications in quantum sensing and quantum information.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

letter,Persistence of engineered nanoparticles in a municipal solid-waste incineration plant,"<p>More than 100 million tonnes of municipal solid waste are incinerated worldwide every year. However, little is known about the fate of nanomaterials during incineration, even though the presence of engineered nanoparticles in waste is expected to grow. Here, we show that cerium oxide nanoparticles introduced into a full-scale waste incineration plant bind loosely to solid residues from the combustion process and can be efficiently removed from flue gas using current filter technology. The nanoparticles were introduced either directly onto the waste before incineration or into the gas stream exiting the furnace of an incinerator that processes 200,000 tonnes of waste per year. Nanoparticles that attached to the surface of the solid residues did not become a fixed part of the residues and did not demonstrate any physical or chemical changes. Our observations show that although it is possible to incinerate waste without releasing nanoparticles into the atmosphere, the residues to which they bind eventually end up in landfills or recovered raw materials, confirming that there is a clear environmental need to develop degradable nanoparticles.</p>",[],False,"[""Tobias Walser"", ""Ludwig K.

letter,Characterization of the motion of membrane proteins using high-speed atomic force microscopy,"<p>For cells to function properly, membrane proteins must be able to diffuse within biological membranes. The functions of these membrane proteins depend on their position and also on protein&#8211;protein and protein&#8211;lipid interactions. However, so far, it has not been possible to study simultaneously the structure and dynamics of biological membranes. Here, we show that the motion of unlabelled membrane proteins can be characterized using high-speed atomic force microscopy. We find that the molecules of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) are widely distributed in the membrane as a result of diffusion-limited aggregation, and while the overall protein motion scales roughly with the local density of proteins in the membrane, individual protein molecules can also diffuse freely or become trapped by protein&#8211;protein interactions. Using these measurements, and the results of molecular dynamics simulations, we determine an interaction potential map and an interaction pathway for a membrane protein, which should provide new insights into the connection between the structures of individual proteins and the structures and dynamics of supramolecular membranes.</p>",[],False,"[""Ignacio Casuso"", ""Jonathan Khao"", ""Mohamed Chami"", ""Perrine Paul-Gilloteaux"", ""Mohamed Husain"", ""Jean-Pierre Duneau"", ""Henning Stahlberg"", ""James N.

letter,Vanadium pentoxide nanoparticles mimic vanadium haloperoxidases and thwart biofilm formation,"<p>Marine biofouling&#8212;the colonization of small marine microorganisms on surfaces that are directly exposed to seawater, such as ships' hulls&#8212;is an expensive problem that is currently without an environmentally compatible solution. Biofouling leads to increased hydrodynamic drag, which, in turn, causes increased fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Tributyltin-free antifouling coatings and paints based on metal complexes or biocides have been shown to efficiently prevent marine biofouling. However, these materials can damage the environment through metal leaching (for example, of copper and zinc) and bacteria resistance. Here, we show that vanadium pentoxide nanowires act like naturally occurring vanadium haloperoxidases to prevent marine biofouling. In the presence of bromide ions and hydrogen peroxide, the nanowires catalyse the oxidation of bromide ions to hypobromous acid (HOBr). Singlet molecular oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) is formed and this exerts strong antibacterial activity, which prevents marine biofouling without being toxic to marine biota.

article,Shear-stress sensitive lenticular vesicles for targeted drug delivery,"<p>Atherosclerosis results in the narrowing of arterial blood vessels and this causes significant changes in the endogenous shear stress between healthy and constricted arteries. Nanocontainers that can release drugs locally with such rheological changes can be very useful. Here, we show that vesicles made from an artificial 1,3-diaminophospholipid are stable under static conditions but release their contents at elevated shear stress. These vesicles have a lenticular morphology, which potentially leads to instabilities along their equator.
