letter,Printing colour at the optical diffraction limit,"<p>The highest possible resolution for printed colour images is determined by the diffraction limit of visible light. To achieve this limit, individual colour elements (or pixels) with a pitch of 250 nm are required, translating into printed images at a resolution of &#8764;100,000 dots per inch (d.p.i.). However, methods for dispensing multiple colourants or fabricating structural colour through plasmonic structures have insufficient resolution and limited scalability. Here, we present a non-colourant method that achieves bright-field colour prints with resolutions up to the optical diffraction limit. Colour information is encoded in the dimensional parameters of metal nanostructures, so that tuning their plasmon resonance determines the colours of the individual pixels. Our colour-mapping strategy produces images with both sharp colour changes and fine tonal variations, is amenable to large-volume colour printing via nanoimprint lithography, and could be useful in making microimages for security, steganography, nanoscale optical filters and high-density spectrally encoded optical data storage.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR, 3 Research Link, Singapore, 117602', 'authors': ['Karthik Kumar', ',\xa0Huigao Duan', ',\xa0Samuel C.

letter,Graphene coating makes carbon nanotube aerogels superelastic and resistant to fatigue,"<p>Lightweight materials that are both highly compressible and resilient under large cyclic strains can be used in a variety of applications. Carbon nanotubes offer a combination of elasticity, mechanical resilience and low density, and these properties have been exploited in nanotube-based foams and aerogels. However, all nanotube-based foams and aerogels developed so far undergo structural collapse or significant plastic deformation with a reduction in compressive strength when they are subjected to cyclic strain. Here, we show that an inelastic aerogel made of single-walled carbon nanotubes can be transformed into a superelastic material by coating it with between one and five layers of graphene nanoplates. The graphene-coated aerogel exhibits no change in mechanical properties after more than 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup> compressive cycles, and its original shape can be recovered quickly after compression release. Moreover, the coating does not affect the structural integrity of the nanotubes or the compressibility and porosity of the nanotube network. The coating also increases Young's modulus and energy storage modulus by a factor of &#8764;6, and the loss modulus by a factor of &#8764;3. We attribute the superelasticity and complete fatigue resistance to the graphene coating strengthening the existing crosslinking points or &#8216;nodes&#8217; in the aerogel.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 15213-3890, Pennsylvania, USA', 'authors': ['Kyu Hun Kim', ',\xa0Youngseok Oh', '\xa0&\xa0M.

letter,Nanoscale patterning of complex magnetic nanostructures by reduction with low-energy protons,"<p>Techniques that can produce patterns with nanoscale details on surfaces have a central role in the development of new electronic, optical and magnetic devices and systems. High-energy ion irradiation can produce nanoscale patterns on ferromagnetic films by destroying the structure of layers or interfaces, but this approach can damage the film and introduce unwanted defects. Moreover, ferromagnetic nanostructures that have been patterned by ion irradiation often interfere with unpatterned regions through exchange interactions, which results in a loss of control over magnetization switching. Here, we demonstrate that low-energy proton irradiation can pattern an array of 100-nm-wide single ferromagnetic domains by reducing [Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Pd]<sub>10</sub> (a paramagnetic oxide) to produce [Co/Pd]<sub>10</sub> (a ferromagnetic metal). Moreover, there are no exchange interactions in the final superlattice, and the ions have a minimal impact on the overall structure, so the interfaces between alternate layers of cobalt (which are 0.6&#160;nm thick) and palladium (1.0&#160;nm) remain intact. This allows the reduced [Co/Pd]<sub>10</sub> superlattice to produce a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy that is stronger than that observed in the metallic [Co/Pd]<sub>10</sub> superlattices we prepared for reference. We also demonstrate that our non-destructive approach can reduce CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to metallic CoFe.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Korea', 'authors': ['Sanghoon Kim', ',\xa0Soogil Lee', ',\xa0Jungho Ko', ',\xa0Jangyup Son', ',\xa0Minseok Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Jongill Hong']}, {'address': 'Mechanical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Korea', 'authors': ['Shinill Kang']}]",False,"['Sanghoon Kim', 'Soogil Lee', 'Jungho Ko', 'Jangyup Son', 'Minseok Kim', 'Shinill Kang', 'Jongill Hong']","Kim, S., Lee, S., Ko, J. et al.

letter,A monolithic array of three-dimensional ion traps fabricated with conventional semiconductor technology,"<p>The coherent control of quantum-entangled states of trapped ions has led to significant advances in quantum information, quantum simulation, quantum metrology and laboratory tests of quantum mechanics and relativity. All of the basic requirements for processing quantum information with arrays of ion-based quantum bits (qubits) have been proven in principle. However, so far, no more than 14 ion-based qubits have been entangled with the ion-trap approach, so there is a clear need for arrays of ion traps that can handle a much larger number of qubits. Traps consisting of a two-dimensional electrode array have undergone significant development, but three-dimensional trap geometries can create a superior confining potential. However, existing three-dimensional approaches, as used in the most advanced experiments with trap arrays, cannot be scaled up to handle greatly increased numbers of ions. Here, we report a monolithic three-dimensional ion microtrap array etched from a silica-on-silicon wafer using conventional semiconductor fabrication technology. We have confined individual <sup>88</sup>Sr<sup>+</sup> ions and strings of up to 14 ions in a single segment of the array. We have measured motional frequencies, ion heating rates and storage times. Our results demonstrate that it should be possible to handle several tens of ion-based qubits with this approach.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Physical Laboratory, Hampton Road, Teddington, TW11 0LW, UK', 'authors': ['Guido Wilpers', ',\xa0Patrick See', ',\xa0Patrick Gill', '\xa0&\xa0Alastair G.

letter,Hybrid passivated colloidal quantum dot solids,"<p>Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) films allow large-area solution processing and bandgap tuning through the quantum size effect. However, the high ratio of surface area to volume makes CQD films prone to high trap state densities if surfaces are imperfectly passivated, promoting recombination of charge carriers that is detrimental to device performance. Recent advances have replaced the long insulating ligands that enable colloidal stability following synthesis with shorter organic linkers or halide anions, leading to improved passivation and higher packing densities. Although this substitution has been performed using solid-state ligand exchange, a solution-based approach is preferable because it enables increased control over the balance of charges on the surface of the quantum dot, which is essential for eliminating midgap trap states. Furthermore, the solution-based approach leverages recent progress in metal:chalcogen chemistry in the liquid phase. Here, we quantify the density of midgap trap states in CQD solids and show that the performance of CQD-based photovoltaics is now limited by electron&#8211;hole recombination due to these states. Next, using density functional theory and optoelectronic device modelling, we show that to improve this performance it is essential to bind a suitable ligand to each potential trap site on the surface of the quantum dot. We then develop a robust hybrid passivation scheme that involves introducing halide anions during the end stages of the synthesis process, which can passivate trap sites that are inaccessible to much larger organic ligands. An organic crosslinking strategy is then used to form the film. Finally, we use our hybrid passivated CQD solid to fabricate a solar cell with a certified efficiency of 7.0%, which is a record for a CQD photovoltaic device.</p>",,"[{'address': ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 10 King's College Road, Toronto, M5S 3G4, Ontario, Canada"", 'authors': ['Alexander H.

letter,Catalytic processes monitored at the nanoscale with tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,"<p>Heterogeneous catalysts play a pivotal role in the chemical industry, but acquiring molecular insights into functioning catalysts remains a significant challenge. Recent advances in micro-spectroscopic approaches have allowed spatiotemporal information to be obtained on the dynamics of single active sites and the diffusion of single molecules. However, these methods lack nanometre-scale spatial resolution and/or require the use of fluorescent labels. Here, we show that time-resolved tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy can monitor photocatalytic reactions at the nanoscale. We use a silver-coated atomic force microscope tip to both enhance the Raman signal and to act as the catalyst. The tip is placed in contact with a self-assembled monolayer of p-nitrothiophenol molecules adsorbed on gold nanoplates. A photocatalytic reduction process is induced at the apex of the tip with green laser light, while red laser light is used to monitor the transformation process during the reaction. This dual-wavelength approach can also be used to observe other molecular effects such as monolayer diffusion.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Debye Institute for Nanomaterial Science, Utrecht University, Universiteitsweg 99, Utrecht, 3584 CG, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Evelien M. van Schrojenstein Lantman', ',\xa0Arjan J.

letter,Piezoelectric nanoribbons for monitoring cellular deformations,"<p>Methods for probing mechanical responses of mammalian cells to electrical excitations can improve our understanding of cellular physiology and function. The electrical response of neuronal cells to applied voltages has been studied in detail, but less is known about their mechanical response to electrical excitations. Studies using atomic force microscopes (AFMs) have shown that mammalian cells exhibit voltage-induced mechanical deflections at nanometre scales, but AFM measurements can be invasive and difficult to multiplex. Here we show that mechanical deformations of neuronal cells in response to electrical excitations can be measured using piezoelectric PbZr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1-</sub><sub>x</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (PZT) nanoribbons, and we find that cells deflect by 1&#160;nm when 120&#160;mV is applied to the cell membrane. The measured cellular forces agree with a theoretical model in which depolarization caused by an applied voltage induces a change in membrane tension, which results in the cell altering its radius so that the pressure remains constant across the membrane. We also transfer arrays of PZT nanoribbons onto a silicone elastomer and measure mechanical deformations on a cow lung that mimics respiration. The PZT nanoribbons offer a minimally invasive and scalable platform for electromechanical biosensing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA', 'authors': ['Thanh D.

article,Deformation mechanisms in nanotwinned metal nanopillars,"<p>Nanotwinned metals are attractive in many applications because they simultaneously demonstrate high strength and high ductility, characteristics that are usually thought to be mutually exclusive. However, most nanotwinned metals are produced in polycrystalline forms and therefore contain randomly oriented twin and grain boundaries making it difficult to determine the origins of their useful mechanical properties. Here, we report the fabrication of arrays of vertically aligned copper nanopillars that contain a very high density of periodic twin boundaries and no grain boundaries or other microstructural features. We use tension experiments, transmission electron microscopy and atomistic simulations to investigate the influence of diameter, twin-boundary spacing and twin-boundary orientation on the mechanical responses of individual nanopillars. We observe a brittle-to-ductile transition in samples with orthogonally oriented twin boundaries as the twin-boundary spacing decreases below a critical value (&#8764;3&#8211;4 nm for copper). We also find that nanopillars with slanted twin boundaries deform via shear offsets and significant detwinning. The ability to decouple nanotwins from other microstructural features should lead to an improved understanding of the mechanical properties of nanotwinned metals.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E.
