letter,Valley–spin blockade and spin resonance in carbon nanotubes,"<p>The manipulation and readout of spin qubits in quantum dots have been successfully achieved using Pauli blockade, which forbids transitions between spin&#8211;triplet and spin&#8211;singlet states. Compared with spin qubits realized in III&#8211;V materials, group IV materials such as silicon and carbon are attractive for this application because of their low decoherence rates (nuclei with zero spins). However, valley degeneracies in the electronic band structure of these materials combined with Coulomb interactions reduce the energy difference between the blocked and unblocked states, significantly weakening the selection rules for Pauli blockade. Recent demonstrations of spin qubits in silicon devices have required strain and spatial confinement to lift the valley degeneracy. In carbon nanotubes, Pauli blockade can be observed by lifting valley degeneracy through disorder, but this makes the confinement potential difficult to control. To achieve Pauli blockade in low-disorder nanotubes, quantum dots have to be made ultrasmall, which is incompatible with conventional fabrication methods. Here, we exploit the bandgap of low-disorder nanotubes to demonstrate robust Pauli blockade based on both valley and spin selection rules. We use a novel stamping technique to create a bent nanotube, in which single-electron spin resonance is detected using the blockade. Our results indicate the feasibility of valley&#8211;spin qubits in carbon nanotubes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, PO Box 5046, Delft, 2600 GA, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Fei Pei', ',\xa0Edward A.

letter,Current-induced magnetic domain wall motion below intrinsic threshold triggered by Walker breakdown,"<p>Controlling the position of a magnetic domain wall with electric current may allow for new types of non-volatile memory and logic devices. To be practical, however, the threshold current density necessary for domain wall motion must be reduced below present values. Intrinsic pinning due to magnetic anisotropy, as recently observed in perpendicularly magnetized Co/Ni nanowires, has been shown to give rise to an intrinsic current threshold J<sub>th</sub><sup>0</sup>. Here, we show that domain wall motion can be induced at current densities 40% below J<sub>th</sub><sup>0</sup> when an external magnetic field of the order of the domain wall pinning field is applied. We observe that the velocity of the domain wall motion is the vector sum of current- and field-induced velocities, and that the domain wall can be driven against the direction of a magnetic field as large as 2,000&#160;Oe, even at currents below J<sub>th</sub><sup>0</sup>. We show that this counterintuitive phenomenon is triggered by Walker breakdown, and that the additive velocities provide a unique way of simultaneously determining the spin polarization of current and the Gilbert damping constant.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Gokasho, Uji, 611-0011, Kyoto, Japan', 'authors': ['T.

letter,All-optical active switching in individual semiconductor nanowires,"<p>The imminent limitations of electronic integrated circuits are stimulating intense activity in the area of nanophotonics for the development of on-chip optical components, and solutions incorporating direct-bandgap semiconductors are important in achieving this end. Optical processing of data at the nanometre scale is promising for circumventing these limitations, but requires the development of a toolbox of components including emitters, detectors, modulators, waveguides and switches. In comparison to components fabricated using top-down methods, semiconductor nanowires offer superior surface properties and stronger optical confinement. They are therefore ideal candidates for nanoscale optical network components, as well as model systems for understanding optical confinement. Here, we demonstrate all-optical switching in individual CdS nanowire cavities with subwavelength dimensions through stimulated polariton scattering, as well as a functional NAND gate built from multiple switches. The device design exploits the strong light&#8211;matter coupling present in these nanowires, leading to footprints that are a fraction of those of comparable silicon-based dielectric contrast and photonic crystal devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 19104, Pennsylvania, USA', 'authors': ['Brian Piccione', ',\xa0Chang-Hee Cho', ',\xa0Lambert K. van Vugt', '\xa0&\xa0Ritesh Agarwal']}]",False,"['Brian Piccione', 'Chang-Hee Cho', 'Lambert K. van Vugt', 'Ritesh Agarwal']","Piccione, B., Cho, C., van Vugt, L. et al.

letter,Structural analysis of strained quantum dots using nuclear magnetic resonance,"<p>Strained semiconductor nanostructures can be used to make single-photon sources, detectors and photovoltaic devices, and could potentially be used to create quantum logic devices. The development of such applications requires techniques capable of nanoscale structural analysis, but the microscopy methods typically used to analyse these materials are destructive. NMR techniques can provide non-invasive structural analysis, but have been restricted to strain-free semiconductor nanostructures because of the significant strain-induced quadrupole broadening of the NMR spectra. Here, we show that optically detected NMR spectroscopy can be used to analyse individual strained quantum dots. Our approach uses continuous-wave broadband radiofrequency excitation with a specially designed spectral pattern and can probe individual strained nanostructures containing only 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup> quadrupole nuclear spins. With this technique, we are able to measure the strain distribution and chemical composition of quantum dots in the volume occupied by the single confined electron. The approach could also be used to address problems in quantum information processing such as the precise control of nuclear spins in the presence of strong quadrupole effects.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S3 7RH, UK', 'authors': ['E.

letter,Site- and alignment-controlled growth of graphene nanoribbons from nickel nanobars,"<p>Graphene nanoribbons combine the unique electronic and spin properties of graphene with a transport gap that arises from quantum confinement and edge effects. This makes them an attractive candidate material for the channels of next-generation transistors. Nanoribbons can be made in a variety of ways, including lithographic, chemical and sonochemical approaches, the unzipping of carbon nanotubes, the thermal decomposition of SiC and organic synthesis. However, the reliable site and alignment control of nanoribbons with high on/off current ratios remains a challenge. Here we control the site and alignment of narrow (&#8764;23 nm) graphene nanoribbons by directly converting a nickel nanobar into a graphene nanoribbon using rapid-heating plasma chemical vapour deposition. The nanoribbons grow directly between the source and drain electrodes of a field-effect transistor without transfer, lithography and other postgrowth treatments, and exhibit a clear transport gap (58.5 meV), a high on/off ratio (&gt;10<sup>4</sup>) and no hysteresis. Complex architectures, including parallel and radial arrays of supported and suspended ribbons, are demonstrated.

letter,Sensing single remote nuclear spins,"<p>The detection of single nuclear spins would be useful for fields ranging from basic science to quantum information technology. However, although sensing based on diamond defects and other methods have shown high sensitivity, they have not been capable of detecting single nuclear spins, and defect-based techniques further require strong defect&#8211;spin coupling. Here, we present the detection and identification of single and remote <sup>13</sup>C nuclear spins embedded in nuclear spin baths surrounding a single electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond. We are able to amplify and detect the weak magnetic field noise (&#8764;10 nT) from a single nuclear spin located &#8764;3 nm from the centre using dynamical decoupling control, and achieve a detectable hyperfine coupling strength as weak as &#8764;300 Hz.

letter,Probing the conductance superposition law in single-molecule circuits with parallel paths,"<p>According to Kirchhoff's circuit laws, the net conductance of two parallel components in an electronic circuit is the sum of the individual conductances. However, when the circuit dimensions are comparable to the electronic phase coherence length, quantum interference effects play a critical role, as exemplified by the Aharonov&#8211;Bohm effect in metal rings. At the molecular scale, interference effects dramatically reduce the electron transfer rate through a meta-connected benzene ring when compared with a para-connected benzene ring. For longer conjugated and cross-conjugated molecules, destructive interference effects have been observed in the tunnelling conductance through molecular junctions. Here, we investigate the conductance superposition law for parallel components in single-molecule circuits, particularly the role of interference. We synthesize a series of molecular systems that contain either one backbone or two backbones in parallel, bonded together cofacially by a common linker on each end. Single-molecule conductance measurements and transport calculations based on density functional theory show that the conductance of a double-backbone molecular junction can be more than twice that of a single-backbone junction, providing clear evidence for constructive interference.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, 500 W. 120th Street, New York, New York 10027, USA', 'authors': ['H.

letter,Imaging the electrocatalytic activity of single nanoparticles,"<p>The electrocatalytic properties of nanoparticles depend on their size, shape and composition. These properties are typically probed by measuring the total electrocatalytic reaction current of a large number of nanoparticles, but this approach is time-consuming and can only measure the average catalytic activity of the nanoparticles under study. However, the identification of new catalysts requires the ability to rapidly measure the properties of nanoparticles synthesized under various conditions and, ideally, to measure the electrocatalytic activity of individual nanoparticles.

letter,Photocurrent of a single photosynthetic protein,"<p>Photosynthesis is used by plants, algae and bacteria to convert solar energy into stable chemical energy. The initial stages of this process&#8212;where light is absorbed and energy and electrons are transferred&#8212;are mediated by reaction centres composed of chlorophyll and carotenoid complexes. It has been previously shown that single small molecules can be used as functional components in electric and optoelectronic circuits, but it has proved difficult to control and probe individual molecules for photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical applications. Here, we show that the photocurrent generated by a single photosynthetic protein&#8212;photosystem I&#8212;can be measured using a scanning near-field optical microscope set-up. One side of the protein is anchored to a gold surface that acts as an electrode, and the other is contacted by a gold-covered glass tip. The tip functions as both counter electrode and light source. A photocurrent of &#8764;10 pA is recorded from the covalently bound single-protein junctions, which is in agreement with the internal electron transfer times of photosystem I.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physik-Department E20, Technische Universität München, James-Franck Strasse, Garching, D-85748, Germany', 'authors': ['Daniel Gerster', ',\xa0Joachim Reichert', ',\xa0Hai Bi', '\xa0&\xa0Johannes V.

letter,M13-templated magnetic nanoparticles for targeted in vivo imaging of prostate cancer,"<p>Molecular imaging allows clinicians to visualize the progression of tumours and obtain relevant information for patient diagnosis and treatment. Owing to their intrinsic optical, electrical and magnetic properties, nanoparticles are promising contrast agents for imaging dynamic molecular and cellular processes such as protein&#8211;protein interactions, enzyme activity or gene expression. Until now, nanoparticles have been engineered with targeting ligands such as antibodies and peptides to improve tumour specificity and uptake. However, excessive loading of ligands can reduce the targeting capabilities of the ligand and reduce the ability of the nanoparticle to bind to a finite number of receptors on cells. Increasing the number of nanoparticles delivered to cells by each targeting molecule would lead to higher signal-to-noise ratios and would improve image contrast. Here, we show that M13 filamentous bacteriophage can be used as a scaffold to display targeting ligands and multiple nanoparticles for magnetic resonance imaging of cancer cells and tumours in mice. Monodisperse iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles assemble along the M13 coat, and its distal end is engineered to display a peptide that targets SPARC glycoprotein, which is overexpressed in various cancers. Compared with nanoparticles that are directly functionalized with targeting peptides, our approach improves contrast because each SPARC-targeting molecule delivers a large number of nanoparticles into the cells. Moreover, the targeting ligand and nanoparticles could be easily exchanged for others, making this platform attractive for in vivo high-throughput screening and molecular detection.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Debadyuti Ghosh', ',\xa0Youjin Lee', ',\xa0Aditya G.
