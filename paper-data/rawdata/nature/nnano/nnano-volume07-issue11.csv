letter,Voltage-dependent conductance of a single graphene nanoribbon,"<p>Graphene nanoribbons could potentially be used to create molecular wires with tailored conductance properties. However, understanding charge transport through a single molecule requires length-dependent conductance measurements and a systematic variation of the electrode potentials relative to the electronic states of the molecule. Here, we show that the conductance properties of a single molecule can be correlated with its electronic states. Using a scanning tunnelling microscope, the electronic structure of a long and narrow graphene nanoribbon, which is adsorbed on a Au(111) surface, is spatially mapped and its conductance then measured by lifting the molecule off the surface with the tip of the microscope. The tunnelling decay length is measured over a wide range of bias voltages, from the localized Tamm states over the gap up to the delocalized occupied and unoccupied electronic states of the nanoribbon. We also show how the conductance depends on the precise atomic structure and bending of the molecule in the junction, illustrating the importance of the edge states and a planar geometry.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physical Chemistry, Fritz-Haber-Institute of the Max-Planck-Society, 14195, Berlin, Germany', 'authors': ['Matthias Koch', '\xa0&\xa0Leonhard Grill']}, {'address': 'Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), 117602, Singapore', 'authors': ['Francisco Ample', '\xa0&\xa0Christian Joachim']}, {'address': 'Nanosciences Group and MANA Satellite, CEMES-CNRS, 31055, Toulouse, France', 'authors': ['Christian Joachim']}]",False,"['Matthias Koch', 'Francisco Ample', 'Christian Joachim', 'Leonhard Grill']","Koch, M., Ample, F., Joachim, C. et al.

letter,Spatially resolved Hall effect measurement in a single semiconductor nanowire,"<p>Efficient light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic energy-harvesting devices are expected to play an important role in the continued efforts towards sustainable global power consumption. Semiconductor nanowires are promising candidates as the active components of both light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells, primarily due to the added freedom in device design offered by the nanowire geometry. However, for nanowire-based components to move past the proof-of-concept stage and be implemented in production-grade devices, it is necessary to precisely quantify and control fundamental material properties such as doping and carrier mobility. Unfortunately, the nanoscale geometry that makes nanowires interesting for applications also makes them inherently difficult to characterize. Here, we report a method to carry out Hall measurements on single core&#8211;shell nanowires. Our technique allows spatially resolved and quantitative determination of the carrier concentration and mobility of the nanowire shell. As Hall measurements have previously been completely unavailable for nanowires, the experimental platform presented here should facilitate the implementation of nanowires in advanced practical devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Solid State Physics, the Nanometer Structure Consortium, Lund University, Box 118, S-221 00, Lund, Sweden', 'authors': ['Kristian Storm', ',\xa0Filip Halvardsson', ',\xa0Magnus Heurlin', ',\xa0David Lindgren', ',\xa0Anders Gustafsson', ',\xa0Phillip M.

letter,Photoresponse of a strongly correlated material determined by scanning photocurrent microscopy,"<p>The generation of a current by light is a key process in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. In band semiconductors, depletion fields associated with interfaces separate long-lived photo-induced carriers. However, in systems with strong electron&#8211;electron and electron&#8211;phonon correlations it is unclear what physics will dominate the photoresponse. Here, we investigate photocurrent in VO<sub>2</sub>, an exemplary strongly correlated material known for its dramatic metal&#8211;insulator transition at T<sub>c</sub>&#160;&#8776;&#160;68&#160;&#176;C, which could be useful for optoelectronic detection and switching up to ultraviolet wavelengths. Using scanning photocurrent microscopy on individual suspended VO<sub>2</sub> nanobeams we observe a photoresponse peaked at the metal&#8211;insulator boundary but extending throughout both insulating and metallic phases. We determine that the response is photothermal, implying efficient carrier relaxation to a local equilibrium in a manner consistent with strong correlations. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal subtle phase changes within the insulating state. We further demonstrate switching of the photocurrent by optical control of the metal&#8211;insulator boundary arrangement. Our work shows the value of applying scanning photocurrent microscopy to nanoscale crystals in the investigation of strongly correlated materials, and the results are relevant for designing and controlling optoelectronic devices employing such materials.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, Washington, USA', 'authors': ['T.

letter,Selective molecular sieving through porous graphene,"<p>Membranes act as selective barriers and play an important role in processes such as cellular compartmentalization and industrial-scale chemical and gas purification. The ideal membrane should be as thin as possible to maximize flux, mechanically robust to prevent fracture, and have well-defined pore sizes to increase selectivity. Graphene is an excellent starting point for developing size-selective membranes because of its atomic thickness, high mechanical strength, relative inertness and impermeability to all standard gases. However, pores that can exclude larger molecules but allow smaller molecules to pass through would have to be introduced into the material. Here, we show that ultraviolet-induced oxidative etching can create pores in micrometre-sized graphene membranes, and the resulting membranes can be used as molecular sieves. A pressurized blister test and mechanical resonance are used to measure the transport of a range of gases (H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, Ar, N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub>) through the pores. The experimentally measured leak rate, separation factors and Raman spectrum agree well with models based on effusion through a small number of &#229;ngstrom-sized pores.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, 80309, Colorado, USA', 'authors': ['Steven P.

letter,Determination of the elastic moduli of thin samples and adherent cells using conical atomic force microscope tips,"<p>The atomic force microscope can detect the mechanical fingerprints of normal and diseased cells at the single-cell level under physiological conditions. However, atomic force microscopy studies of cell mechanics are limited by the &#8216;bottom effect&#8217; artefact that arises from the stiff substrates used to culture cells. Because cells adhered to substrates are very thin, this artefact makes cells appear stiffer than they really are. Here, we show an analytical correction that accounts for this artefact when conical tips are used for atomic force microscope measurements of thin samples. Our bottom effect cone correction (BECC) corrects the Sneddon's model, which is widely used to measure Young's modulus, E. Comparing the performance of BECC and Sneddon's model on thin polyacrylamide gels, we find that although Sneddon's model overestimates E, BECC yields E values that are thickness-independent and similar to those obtained on thick regions of the gel. The application of BECC to measurements on live adherent fibroblasts demonstrates a significant improvement on the estimation of their local mechanical properties.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Auditory Mechanics Section, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health, Building 10 Rm. 5D49, 10 Center Drive, MSC-1417, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, USA', 'authors': ['Núria Gavara', '\xa0&\xa0Richard S.

article,Low-resistance spin injection into silicon using graphene tunnel barriers,"<p>Spin manipulation in a semiconductor offers a new paradigm for device operation beyond Moore's law. Ferromagnetic metals are ideal contacts for spin injection and detection, but the intervening tunnel barrier required to accommodate the large difference in conductivity introduces defects, trapped charge and material interdiffusion, which severely compromise performance. Here, we show that single-layer graphene successfully circumvents the classic issue of conductivity mismatch between a metal and a semiconductor for electrical spin injection and detection, providing a highly uniform, chemically inert and thermally robust tunnel barrier. We demonstrate electrical generation and detection of spin accumulation in silicon above room temperature, and show that the contact resistance&#8211;area products are two to three orders of magnitude lower than those achieved with oxide tunnel barriers on silicon substrates with identical doping levels. Our results identify a new route to low resistance&#8211;area product spin-polarized contacts, a key requirement for semiconductor spintronic devices that rely on two-terminal magnetoresistance, including spin-based transistors, logic and memory.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, 20375, DC, USA', 'authors': [""O.

article,An 18.2%-efficient black-silicon solar cell achieved through control of carrier recombination in nanostructures,"<p>Silicon nanowire and nanopore arrays promise to reduce manufacturing costs and increase the power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices. So far, however, photovoltaic cells based on nanostructured silicon exhibit lower power conversion efficiencies than conventional cells due to the enhanced photocarrier recombination associated with the nanostructures.

By identifying the regimes of junction doping concentration in which each mechanism dominates, we were able to design and fabricate an independently confirmed 18.2%-efficient nanostructured &#8216;black-silicon&#8217; cell that does not need the antireflection coating layer(s) normally required to reach a comparable performance level.

article,In situ atomic-scale imaging of electrochemical lithiation in silicon,"<p>In lithium-ion batteries, the electrochemical reaction between the electrodes and lithium is a critical process that controls the capacity, cyclability and reliability of the battery. Despite intensive study, the atomistic mechanism of the electrochemical reactions occurring in these solid-state electrodes remains unclear. Here, we show that in situ transmission electron microscopy can be used to study the dynamic lithiation process of single-crystal silicon with atomic resolution. We observe a sharp interface (&#8764;1 nm thick) between the crystalline silicon and an amorphous Li<sub>x</sub>Si alloy. The lithiation kinetics are controlled by the migration of the interface, which occurs through a ledge mechanism involving the lateral movement of ledges on the close-packed {111} atomic planes. Such ledge flow processes produce the amorphous Li<sub>x</sub>Si alloy through layer-by-layer peeling of the {111} atomic facets, resulting in the orientation-dependent mobility of the interfaces.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, 87185, New Mexico, USA', 'authors': ['Xiao Hua Liu', ',\xa0Yang Liu', '\xa0&\xa0Jian Yu Huang']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, 15261, Pennsylvania, USA', 'authors': ['Jiang Wei Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Scott X.

article,The nanomechanical signature of breast cancer,"<p>Cancer initiation and progression follow complex molecular and structural changes in the extracellular matrix and cellular architecture of living tissue. However, it remains poorly understood how the transformation from health to malignancy alters the mechanical properties of cells within the tumour microenvironment. Here, we show using an indentation-type atomic force microscope (IT-AFM) that unadulterated human breast biopsies display distinct stiffness profiles. Correlative stiffness maps obtained on normal and benign tissues show uniform stiffness profiles that are characterized by a single distinct peak. In contrast, malignant tissues have a broad distribution resulting from tissue heterogeneity, with a prominent low-stiffness peak representative of cancer cells. Similar findings are seen in specific stages of breast cancer in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice. Further evidence obtained from the lungs of mice with late-stage tumours shows that migration and metastatic spreading is correlated to the low stiffness of hypoxia-associated cancer cells. Overall, nanomechanical profiling by IT-AFM provides quantitative indicators in the clinical diagnostics of breast cancer with translational significance.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Biozentrum and the Swiss Nanoscience Institute, University of Basel, Basel, 4056, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Marija Plodinec', ',\xa0Marko Loparic', ',\xa0Christophe A.
