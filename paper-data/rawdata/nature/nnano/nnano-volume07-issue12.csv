letter,High-density integration of carbon nanotubes via chemical self-assembly,"<p>Carbon nanotubes have potential in the development of high-speed and power-efficient logic applications. However, for such technologies to be viable, a high density of semiconducting nanotubes must be placed at precise locations on a substrate. Here, we show that ion-exchange chemistry can be used to fabricate arrays of individually positioned carbon nanotubes with a density as high as 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>9</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#8212;two orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. With this approach, we assembled a high density of carbon-nanotube transistors in a conventional semiconductor fabrication line and then electrically tested more than 10,000 devices in a single chip. The ability to characterize such large distributions of nanotube devices is crucial for analysing transistor performance, yield and semiconducting nanotube purity.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM T. J.

letter,Long-lived photoinduced magnetization in copper-doped ZnSe–CdSe core–shell nanocrystals,"<p>Nanoscale materials have been investigated extensively for applications in memory and data storage. Recent advances include memories based on metal nanoparticles, nanoscale phase-change materials and molecular switches. Traditionally, magnetic storage materials make use of magnetic fields to address individual storage elements. However, new materials with magnetic properties addressable via alternative means (for example, electrical or optical) may lead to improved flexibility and storage density and are therefore very desirable. Here, we demonstrate that copper-doped chalcogenide nanocrystals exhibit not only the classic signatures of diluted magnetic semiconductors&#8212;namely, a strong spin-exchange interaction between paramagnetic Cu<sup>2+</sup> dopants and the conduction/valence bands of the host semiconductor&#8212;but also show a pronounced and long-lived photoinduced enhancement of their paramagnetic response. Magnetic circular dichroism studies reveal that paramagnetism in these nanocrystals can be controlled and increased by up to 100% when illuminated with above-gap (blue/ultraviolet) light. These materials retain a memory of the photomagnetization for hour-long timescales in the dark, with effects persisting up to &#8764;80 K.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Chemistry Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, 87545, New Mexico, USA', 'authors': ['A.

letter,A nanocomposite ultraviolet photodetector based on interfacial trap-controlled charge injection,"<p>Ultraviolet photodetectors have applications in fields such as medicine, communications and defence, and are typically made from single-crystalline silicon, silicon carbide or gallium nitride p&#8211;n junction photodiodes. However, such inorganic photodetectors are unsuitable for certain applications because of their high cost and low responsivity (&lt;0.2&#160;A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Solution-processed photodetectors based on organic materials and/or nanomaterials could be significantly cheaper to manufacture, but their performance so far has been limited. Here, we show that a solution-processed ultraviolet photodetector with a nanocomposite active layer composed of ZnO nanoparticles blended with semiconducting polymers can significantly outperform inorganic photodetectors. As a result of interfacial trap-controlled charge injection, the photodetector transitions from a photodiode with a rectifying Schottky contact in the dark, to a photoconductor with an ohmic contact under illumination, and therefore combines the low dark current of a photodiode and the high responsivity of a photoconductor (&#8764;721&#8211;1,001 A W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>).

letter,Highly stretchable electric circuits from a composite material of silver nanoparticles and elastomeric fibres,"<p>Conductive electrodes and electric circuits that can remain active and electrically stable under large mechanical deformations are highly desirable for applications such as flexible displays, field-effect transistors, energy-related devices, smart clothing and actuators. However, high conductivity and stretchability seem to be mutually exclusive parameters. The most promising solution to this problem has been to use one-dimensional nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and metal nanowires coated on a stretchable fabric, metal stripes with a wavy geometry, composite elastomers embedding conductive fillers and interpenetrating networks of a liquid metal and rubber. At present, the conductivity values at large strains remain too low to satisfy requirements for practical applications. Moreover, the ability to make arbitrary patterns over large areas is also desirable. Here, we introduce a conductive composite mat of silver nanoparticles and rubber fibres that allows the formation of highly stretchable circuits through a fabrication process that is compatible with any substrate and scalable for large-area applications. A silver nanoparticle precursor is absorbed in electrospun poly (styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) (SBS) rubber fibres and then converted into silver nanoparticles directly in the fibre mat. Percolation of the silver nanoparticles inside the fibres leads to a high bulk conductivity, which is preserved at large deformations (&#963;&#160;&#8776;&#160;2,200&#160;S&#160;cm<sup>&#8211;1</sup> at 100% strain for a 150-&#181;m-thick mat). We design electric circuits directly on the electrospun fibre mat by nozzle printing, inkjet printing and spray printing of the precursor solution and fabricate a highly stretchable antenna, a strain sensor and a highly stretchable light-emitting diode as examples of applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, 134 Shinchon-dong, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Minwoo Park', ',\xa0Minkwan Shin', ',\xa0Yuho Min', ',\xa0Jaeyoon Park', '\xa0&\xa0Unyong Jeong']}, {'address': 'Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Mt.14-1, Nongseo-Dong, Giheung-Gu, Yongin-Si, Gyeonggi-Do 446–712, Korea', 'authors': ['Jungkyun Im', ',\xa0Mun-Bo Shim', ',\xa0Sanghun Jeon', ',\xa0Dae-Young Chung', ',\xa0Jihyun Bae', ',\xa0Jongjin Park', '\xa0&\xa0Kinam Kim']}, {'address': 'Interdisciplinary School of Green Energy, UNIST, Ulsan 689–798, Korea', 'authors': ['Heesook Cho', '\xa0&\xa0Soojin Park']}]",False,"['Minwoo Park', 'Jungkyun Im', 'Minkwan Shin', 'Yuho Min', 'Jaeyoon Park', 'Heesook Cho', 'Soojin Park', 'Mun-Bo Shim', 'Sanghun Jeon', 'Dae-Young Chung', 'Jihyun Bae', 'Jongjin Park', 'Unyong Jeong', 'Kinam Kim']","Park, M., Im, J., Shin, M. et al.

letter,A regenerable oxide-based H2S adsorbent with nanofibrous morphology,"<p>Hydrogen sulphide is found in raw fuels such as natural gas and coal/biomass-derived syngas. It is poisonous to catalysts and corrosive to metals and therefore needs to be removed. This is often achieved using metal oxides as reactive adsorbents, but metal oxides perform poorly when subjected to repeated cycles of sulphidation and re-oxidation as a result of complex structural and chemical changes. Here, we show that Zn&#8211;Ti&#8211;O-based adsorbents with nanofibrous morphology can sustain their initial reactivity and sulphur removal capacity over multiple regeneration cycles. These nanostructured sorbents offer rapid reaction rates that overcome the gas-transport limitations of conventional pellet-based sorbents and allow all of the material to be used efficiently. Regeneration can be carried out at the same temperature as the sulphidation step because of the higher reactivity, which prevents sorbent deterioration and reduces energy use. The efficient regeneration of the adsorbent is also aided by structural features such as the growth of hierarchical nanostructures and preferential stabilization of a wurtzite phase in the sulphidation product.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 600 S.

letter,A mechanical metamaterial made from a DNA hydrogel,"<p>Metamaterials are artificial substances that are structurally engineered to have properties not typically found in nature. To date, almost all metamaterials have been made from inorganic materials such as silicon and copper, which have unusual electromagnetic or acoustic properties that allow them to be used, for example, as invisible cloaks, superlenses or super absorbers for sound. Here, we show that metamaterials with unusual mechanical properties can be prepared using DNA as a building block. We used a polymerase enzyme to elongate DNA chains and weave them non-covalently into a hydrogel. The resulting material, which we term a meta-hydrogel, has liquid-like properties when taken out of water and solid-like properties when in water. Moreover, upon the addition of water, and after complete deformation, the hydrogel can be made to return to its original shape. The meta-hydrogel has a hierarchical internal structure and, as an example of its potential applications, we use it to create an electric circuit that uses water as a switch.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Jong Bum Lee', ',\xa0Songming Peng', ',\xa0Dayong Yang', ',\xa0Young Hoon Roh', ',\xa0Hisakage Funabashi', ',\xa0Nokyoung Park', ',\xa0Edward J.

letter,Plasmonic ELISA for the ultrasensitive detection of disease biomarkers with the naked eye,"<p>In resource-constrained countries, affordable methodologies for the detection of disease biomarkers at ultralow concentrations can potentially improve the standard of living. However, current strategies for ultrasensitive detection often require sophisticated instruments that may not be available in laboratories with fewer resources. Here, we circumvent this problem by introducing a signal generation mechanism for biosensing that enables the detection of a few molecules of analyte with the naked eye. The enzyme label of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) controls the growth of gold nanoparticles and generates coloured solutions with distinct tonality when the analyte is present.

article,An electrically and mechanically self-healing composite with pressure- and flexion-sensitive properties for electronic skin applications,"<p>Pressure sensitivity and mechanical self-healing are two vital functions of the human skin. A flexible and electrically conducting material that can sense mechanical forces and yet be able to self-heal repeatably can be of use in emerging fields such as soft robotics and biomimetic prostheses, but combining all these properties together remains a challenging task. Here, we describe a composite material composed of a supramolecular organic polymer with embedded nickel nanostructured microparticles, which shows mechanical and electrical self-healing properties at ambient conditions. We also show that our material is pressure- and flexion-sensitive, and therefore suitable for electronic skin applications. The electrical conductivity can be tuned by varying the amount of nickel particles and can reach values as high as 40&#160;S&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. On rupture, the initial conductivity is repeatably restored with &#8764;90% efficiency after 15 s healing time, and the mechanical properties are completely restored after &#8764;10 min. The composite resistance varies inversely with applied flexion and tactile forces. These results demonstrate that natural skin's repeatable self-healing capability can be mimicked in conductive and piezoresistive materials, thus potentially expanding the scope of applications of current electronic skin systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, David Packard Building, Stanford, California, 94305, USA', 'authors': ['Benjamin C-K.
