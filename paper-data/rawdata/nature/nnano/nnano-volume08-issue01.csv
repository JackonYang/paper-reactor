letter,Fully gapped superconductivity in a nanometre-size YBa2Cu3O7–δ island enhanced by a magnetic field,"<p>The symmetry of Cooper pairs is central to constructing a superconducting state. The demonstration of a -wave order parameter with nodes represented a breakthrough for high critical temperature superconductors (HTSs). However, despite this fundamental discovery, the origin of superconductivity remains elusive, raising the question of whether something is missing from the global picture. Deviations from -wave symmetry, such as an imaginary admixture &#160;+&#160;is (or id<sub>xy</sub>), predict a ground state with unconventional properties exhibiting a full superconducting gap and time reversal symmetry breaking. The existence of such a state, until now highly controversial, can be proved by highly sensitive measurements of the excitation spectrum. Here, we present a spectroscopic technique based on an HTS nanoscale device that allows an unprecedented energy resolution thanks to Coulomb blockade effects, a regime practically inaccessible in these materials previously. We find that the energy required to add an extra electron depends on the parity (odd/even) of the excess electrons on the island and increases with magnetic field. This is inconsistent with a pure -wave symmetry and demonstrates a complex order parameter component that needs to be incorporated into any theoretical model of HTS.</p>",[],False,"[""D.

letter,Real-space imaging of fractional quantum Hall liquids,"<p>Electrons in semiconductors usually behave like a gas&#8212;as independent particles. However, when confined to two dimensions under a perpendicular magnetic field at low temperatures, they condense into an incompressible quantum liquid. This phenomenon, known as the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect, is a quantum-mechanical manifestation of the macroscopic behaviour of correlated electrons that arises when the Landau-level filling factor is a rational fraction. However, the diverse microscopic interactions responsible for its emergence have been hidden by its universality and macroscopic nature. Here, we report real-space imaging of FQH liquids, achieved with polarization-sensitive scanning optical microscopy using trions (charged excitons) as a local probe for electron spin polarization. When the FQH ground state is spin-polarized, the triplet/singlet intensity map exhibits a spatial pattern that mirrors the intrinsic disorder potential, which is interpreted as a mapping of compressible and incompressible electron liquids. In contrast, when FQH ground states with different spin polarization coexist, domain structures with spontaneous quasi-long-range order emerge, which can be reproduced remarkably well from the disorder patterns using a two-dimensional random-field Ising model. Our results constitute the first reported real-space observation of quantum liquids in a class of broken symmetry state known as the quantum Hall ferromagnet.</p>",[],False,"[""Junichiro Hayakawa"", ""Koji Muraki"", ""Go Yusa""]","Hayakawa, J., Muraki, K. & Yusa, G.

letter,A sub-1-volt nanoelectromechanical switching device,"<p>Nanoelectromechanical (NEM) switches have received widespread attention as promising candidates in the drive to surmount the physical limitations currently faced by complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The NEM switch has demonstrated superior characteristics including quasi-zero leakage behaviour, excellent density capability and operation in harsh environments. However, an unacceptably high operating voltage (4&#8211;20&#160;V) has posed a major obstacle in the practical use of the NEM switch in low-power integrated circuits. To utilize the NEM switch widely as a core device component in ultralow power applications, the operation voltage needs to be reduced to 1&#160;V or below. However, sub-1&#160;V actuation has not yet been demonstrated because of fabrication difficulties and irreversible switching failure caused by surface adhesion. Here, we report the sub-1&#160;V operation of a NEM switch through the introduction of a novel pipe clip device structure and an effective air gap fabrication technique. This achievement is primarily attributed to the incorporation of a 4-nm-thick air gap, which is the smallest reported so far for a NEM switch generated using a &#8216;top-down&#8217; approach. Our structure and process can potentially be utilized in various nanogap-related applications, including NEM switch-based ultralow-power integrated circuits, NEM resonators, nanogap electrodes for scientific research and sensors.</p>",[],False,"[""Jeong Oen Lee"", ""Yong-Ha Song"", ""Min-Wu Kim"", ""Min-Ho Kang"", ""Jae-Sub Oh"", ""Hyun-Ho Yang"", ""Jun-Bo Yoon""]","Lee, J., Song, YH., Kim, MW. et al.A sub-1-volt nanoelectromechanical switching device.

letter,Growth of a two-dimensional dielectric monolayer on quasi-freestanding graphene,"<p>Integrating graphene into device architectures requires interfacing graphene with dielectric materials. However, the dewetting and thermal instability of dielectric layers on top of graphene makes fabricating continuous graphene/dielectric interfaces challenging. Here, we show that yttria (Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)&#8212;a high-&#954; dielectric&#8212;can form a complete monolayer on platinum-supported graphene. The monolayer interacts weakly with graphene, but is stable to high temperatures. Scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals that the yttria layer exhibits a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice rotated by 30&#176; relative to the hexagonal graphene lattice. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements indicate a shift of the Fermi level in graphene on yttria deposition, which suggests that dielectric layers could be used for charge doping of metal-supported graphene.</p>",[],False,"[""Rafik Addou"", ""Arjun Dahal"", ""Matthias Batzill""]","Addou, R., Dahal, A. & Batzill, M.

letter,Controlled clockwise and anticlockwise rotational switching of a molecular motor,"<p>The design of artificial molecular machines often takes inspiration from macroscopic machines. However, the parallels between the two systems are often only superficial, because most molecular machines are governed by quantum processes. Previously, rotary molecular motors powered by light and chemical energy have been developed. In electrically driven motors, tunnelling electrons from the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope have been used to drive the rotation of a simple rotor in a single direction and to move a four-wheeled molecule across a surface. Here, we show that a stand-alone molecular motor adsorbed on a gold surface can be made to rotate in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction by selective inelastic electron tunnelling through different subunits of the motor. Our motor is composed of a tripodal stator for vertical positioning, a five-arm rotor for controlled rotations, and a ruthenium atomic ball bearing connecting the static and rotational parts. The directional rotation arises from sawtooth-like rotational potentials, which are solely determined by the internal molecular structure and are independent of the surface adsorption site.</p>",[],False,"[""U.

letter,Electrostatic assembly of binary nanoparticle superlattices using protein cages,"<p>Binary nanoparticle superlattices are periodic nanostructures with lattice constants much shorter than the wavelength of light and could be used to prepare multifunctional metamaterials. Such superlattices are typically made from synthetic nanoparticles, and although biohybrid structures have been developed, incorporating biological building blocks into binary nanoparticle superlattices remains challenging. Protein-based nanocages provide a complex yet monodisperse and geometrically well-defined hollow cage that can be used to encapsulate different materials. Such protein cages have been used to program the self-assembly of encapsulated materials to form free-standing crystals and superlattices at interfaces or in solution. Here, we show that electrostatically patchy protein cages&#8212;cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and ferritin cages&#8212;can be used to direct the self-assembly of three-dimensional binary superlattices. The negatively charged cages can encapsulate RNA or superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, and the superlattices are formed through tunable electrostatic interactions with positively charged gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles and viruses form an AB<sub>8</sub><sup>fcc</sup> crystal structure that is not isostructural with any known atomic or molecular crystal structure and has previously been observed only with large colloidal polymer particles. Gold nanoparticles and empty or nanoparticle-loaded ferritin cages form an interpenetrating simple cubic AB structure (isostructural with CsCl).
