review article,Multi-electrode array technologies for neuroscience and cardiology,"<p>At present, the prime methodology for studying neuronal circuit-connectivity, physiology and pathology under in vitro or in vivo conditions is by using substrate-integrated microelectrode arrays. Although this methodology permits simultaneous, cell-non-invasive, long-term recordings of extracellular field potentials generated by action potentials, it is 'blind' to subthreshold synaptic potentials generated by single cells. On the other hand, intracellular recordings of the full electrophysiological repertoire (subthreshold synaptic potentials, membrane oscillations and action potentials) are, at present, obtained only by sharp or patch microelectrodes. These, however, are limited to single cells at a time and for short durations. Recently a number of laboratories began to merge the advantages of extracellular microelectrode arrays and intracellular microelectrodes. This Review describes the novel approaches, identifying their strengths and limitations from the point of view of the end users &#8212; with the intention to help steer the bioengineering efforts towards the needs of brain-circuit research.</p>",,"[{'address': 'The Alexander Silberman Life Sciences Institute, and the Harvey M.

letter,A subwavelength plasmonic metamolecule exhibiting magnetic-based optical Fano resonance,"<p>The lack of symmetry between electric and magnetic charges, a fundamental consequence of the small value of the fine-structure constant, is directly related to the weakness of magnetic effects in optical materials. Properly tailored plasmonic nanoclusters have been proposed recently to induce artificial optical magnetism based on the principle that magnetic effects are indistinguishable from specific forms of spatial dispersion of permittivity at optical frequencies. In a different context, plasmonic Fano resonances have generated a great deal of interest, particularly for use in sensing applications that benefit from sharp spectral features and extreme field localization. In the absence of natural magnetism, optical Fano resonances have so far been based on purely electric effects. In this Letter, we demonstrate that a subwavelength plasmonic metamolecule consisting of four closely spaced gold nanoparticles supports a strong magnetic response coupled to a broad electric resonance. Small structural asymmetries in the assembled nanoring enable the interaction between electric and magnetic modes, leading to the first observation of a magnetic-based Fano scattering resonance at optical frequencies. Our findings are supported by excellent agreement with simulations and analytical calculations, and represent an important step towards the quest for artificial magnetism and negative refractive index metamaterials at optical frequencies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Center for Complex Quantum Systems, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, 78712, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Farbod Shafiei', ',\xa0Thomas Hartsfield', '\xa0&\xa0Xiaoqin Li']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, 78712, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Francesco Monticone', ',\xa0Khai Q.

letter,Vertical field-effect transistor based on graphene–WS2 heterostructures for flexible and transparent electronics,"<p>The celebrated electronic properties of graphene have opened the way for materials just one atom thick to be used in the post-silicon electronic era. An important milestone was the creation of heterostructures based on graphene and other two-dimensional crystals, which can be assembled into three-dimensional stacks with atomic layer precision. Such layered structures have already demonstrated a range of fascinating physical phenomena, and have also been used in demonstrating a prototype field-effect tunnelling transistor, which is regarded to be a candidate for post-CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology. The range of possible materials that could be incorporated into such stacks is very large. Indeed, there are many other materials with layers linked by weak van der Waals forces that can be exfoliated and combined together to create novel highly tailored heterostructures. Here, we describe a new generation of field-effect vertical tunnelling transistors where two-dimensional tungsten disulphide serves as an atomically thin barrier between two layers of either mechanically exfoliated or chemical vapour deposition-grown graphene. The combination of tunnelling (under the barrier) and thermionic (over the barrier) transport allows for unprecedented current modulation exceeding 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup> at room temperature and very high ON current. These devices can also operate on transparent and flexible substrates.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK', 'authors': ['Thanasis Georgiou', ',\xa0Liam Britnell', ',\xa0Yong-Jin Kim', ',\xa0Laurence Eaves', ',\xa0Leonid A.

letter,Magnetic quantum ratchet effect in graphene,"<p>A periodically driven system with spatial asymmetry can exhibit a directed motion facilitated by thermal or quantum fluctuations. This so-called ratchet effect has fascinating ramifications in engineering and natural sciences. Graphene is nominally a symmetric system. Driven by a periodic electric field, no directed electric current should flow. However, if the graphene has lost its spatial symmetry due to its substrate or adatoms, an electronic ratchet motion can arise. We report an experimental demonstration of such an electronic ratchet in graphene layers, proving the underlying spatial asymmetry. The orbital asymmetry of the Dirac fermions is induced by an in-plane magnetic field, whereas the periodic driving comes from terahertz radiation. The resulting magnetic quantum ratchet transforms the a.c. power into a d.c. current, extracting work from the out-of-equilibrium electrons driven by undirected periodic forces. The observation of ratchet transport in this purest possible two-dimensional system indicates that the orbital effects may appear and be substantial in other two-dimensional crystals such as boron nitride, molybdenum dichalcogenides and related heterostructures. The measurable orbital effects in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field provide strong evidence for the existence of structure inversion asymmetry in graphene.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Terahertz Center, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, 93040, Germany', 'authors': ['C.

letter,Nanoscale wear as a stress-assisted chemical reaction,"<p>Wear of sliding contacts leads to energy dissipation and device failure, resulting in massive economic and environmental costs. Typically, wear phenomena are described empirically, because physical and chemical interactions at sliding interfaces are not fully understood at any length scale. Fundamental insights from individual nanoscale contacts are crucial for understanding wear at larger length scales, and to enable reliable nanoscale devices, manufacturing and microscopy. Observable nanoscale wear mechanisms include fracture and plastic deformation, but recent experiments and models propose another mechanism: wear via atom-by-atom removal (&#8216;atomic attrition&#8217;), which can be modelled using stress-assisted chemical reaction kinetics. Experimental evidence for this has so far been inferential. Here, we quantitatively measure the wear of silicon&#8212;a material relevant to small-scale devices&#8212;using in situ transmission electron microscopy. We resolve worn volumes as small as 25&#160;&#177;&#160;5&#160;nm<sup>3</sup>, a factor of 10<sup>3</sup> lower than is achievable using alternative techniques. Wear of silicon against diamond is consistent with atomic attrition, and inconsistent with fracture or plastic deformation, as shown using direct imaging. The rate of atom removal depends exponentially on stress in the contact, as predicted by chemical rate kinetics. Measured activation parameters are consistent with an atom-by-atom process. These results, by direct observation, establish atomic attrition as the primary wear mechanism of silicon in vacuum at low loads.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, 3231 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, 19104, Pennsylvania, USA', 'authors': ['Tevis D.

letter,The role of van der Waals forces in the performance of molecular diodes,"<p>One of the main goals of organic and molecular electronics is to relate the performance and electronic function of devices to the chemical structure and intermolecular interactions of the organic component inside them, which can take the form of an organic thin film, a self-assembled monolayer or a single molecule. This goal is difficult to achieve because organic and molecular electronic devices are complex physical&#8211;organic systems that consist of at least two electrodes, an organic component and two (different) organic/inorganic interfaces. Singling out the contribution of each of these components remains challenging. So far, strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions have mainly been considered for the rational design and optimization of the performances of organic electronic devices, and weaker intermolecular interactions have largely been ignored. Here, we show experimentally that subtle changes in the intermolecular van der Waals interactions in the active component of a molecular diode dramatically impact the performance of the device. In particular, we observe an odd&#8211;even effect as the number of alkyl units is varied in a ferrocene&#8211;alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayer. As a result of a more favourable van der Waals interaction, junctions made from an odd number of alkyl units have a lower packing energy (by &#8764;0.4&#8211;0.6 kcal mol<sup>&#8211;1</sup>), rectify currents 10 times more efficiently, give a 10% higher yield in working devices, and can be made two to three times more reproducibly than junctions made from an even number of alkyl units.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 3, 117543, Singapore', 'authors': ['Nisachol Nerngchamnong', ',\xa0Li Yuan', ',\xa0Jiang Li', '\xa0&\xa0Christian A.

letter,In-plane heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride with controlled domain sizes,"<p>Graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have similar crystal structures with a lattice constant difference of only 2%. However, graphene is a zero-bandgap semiconductor with remarkably high carrier mobility at room temperature, whereas an atomically thin layer of h-BN is a dielectric with a wide bandgap of &#8764;5.9 eV. Accordingly, if precise two-dimensional domains of graphene and h-BN can be seamlessly stitched together, hybrid atomic layers with interesting electronic applications could be created. Here, we show that planar graphene/h-BN heterostructures can be formed by growing graphene in lithographically patterned h-BN atomic layers. Our approach can create periodic arrangements of domains with size ranging from tens of nanometres to millimetres. The resulting graphene/h-BN atomic layers can be peeled off the growth substrate and transferred to various platforms including flexible substrates. We also show that the technique can be used to fabricate two-dimensional devices, such as a split closed-loop resonator that works as a bandpass filter.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Rice University, Houston, 77005, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Zheng Liu', ',\xa0Lulu Ma', ',\xa0Gang Shi', ',\xa0Yongji Gong', ',\xa0Sidong Lei', ',\xa0Jiangnan Zhang', ',\xa0Ken P.

letter,Direct detection of a BRAF mutation in total RNA from melanoma cells using cantilever arrays,"<p>Malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is characterized by a predominant mutation in the BRAF gene. Drugs that target tumours carrying this mutation have recently entered the clinic. Accordingly, patients are routinely screened for mutations in this gene to determine whether they can benefit from this type of treatment. The current gold standard for mutation screening uses real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods. Here we show that an assay based on microcantilever arrays can detect the mutation nanomechanically without amplification in total RNA samples isolated from melanoma cells. The assay is based on a BRAF-specific oligonucleotide probe. We detected mutant BRAF at a concentration of 500&#160;pM in a 50-fold excess of the wild-type sequence. The method was able to distinguish melanoma cells carrying the mutation from wild-type cells using as little as 20&#160;ng&#160;&#181;l<sup>&#8211;1</sup> of RNA material, without prior PCR amplification and use of labels.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Swiss Nano Institute, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 82, Basel, 4056, Switzerland', 'authors': ['F.

letter,Peptide nanofibrils boost retroviral gene transfer and provide a rapid means for concentrating viruses,"<p>Inefficient gene transfer and low virion concentrations are common limitations of retroviral transduction. We and others have previously shown that peptides derived from human semen form amyloid fibrils that boost retroviral gene delivery by promoting virion attachment to the target cells. However, application of these natural fibril-forming peptides is limited by moderate efficiencies, the high costs of peptide synthesis, and variability in fibril size and formation kinetics. Here, we report the development of nanofibrils that self-assemble in aqueous solution from a 12-residue peptide, termed enhancing factor C (EF-C). These artificial nanofibrils enhance retroviral gene transfer substantially more efficiently than semen-derived fibrils or other transduction enhancers. Moreover, EF-C nanofibrils allow the concentration of retroviral vectors by conventional low-speed centrifugation, and are safe and effective, as assessed in an ex vivo gene transfer study. Our results show that EF-C fibrils comprise a highly versatile, convenient and broadly applicable nanomaterial that holds the potential to significantly facilitate retroviral gene transfer in basic research and clinical applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Meyerhofstrasse 1, Ulm, 89081, Germany', 'authors': ['Maral Yolamanova', ',\xa0Franziska Arnold', ',\xa0Onofrio Zirafi', ',\xa0Shariq M.

letter,Transferrin-functionalized nanoparticles lose their targeting capabilities when a biomolecule corona adsorbs on the surface,"<p>Nanoparticles have been proposed as carriers for drugs, genes and therapies to treat various diseases. Many strategies have been developed to target nanomaterials to specific or over-expressed receptors in diseased cells, and these typically involve functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with proteins, antibodies or other biomolecules. Here, we show that the targeting ability of such functionalized nanoparticles may disappear when they are placed in a biological environment. Using transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles, we found that proteins in the media can shield transferrin from binding to both its targeted receptors on cells and soluble transferrin receptors. Although nanoparticles continue to enter cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin is lost. Our results suggest that when nanoparticles are placed in a complex biological environment, interaction with other proteins in the medium and the formation of a protein corona can &#8216;screen&#8217; the targeting molecules on the surface of nanoparticles and cause loss of specificity in targeting.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Centre for BioNano Interactions, School of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, UCD Conway Institute for Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Belfield, 4, Dublin, Ireland', 'authors': ['Anna Salvati', ',\xa0Andrzej S.
