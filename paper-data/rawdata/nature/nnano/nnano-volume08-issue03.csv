letter,Strong spin–phonon coupling between a single-molecule magnet and a carbon nanotube nanoelectromechanical system,"<p>Magnetic relaxation processes were first discussed for a crystal of paramagnetic transition ions. It was suggested that mechanical vibrations of the crystal lattice (phonons) modulate the crystal electric field of the magnetic ion, thus inducing a &#8216;direct&#8217; relaxation between two different spin states. Direct relaxation has also been predicted for single-molecule magnets with a large spin and a high magnetic anisotropy and was first demonstrated in a Mn<sub>12</sub> acetate crystal. The spin-lattice relaxation time for such a direct transition is limited by the phonon density of states at the spin resonance. In a three-dimensional system, such as a single-molecule magnet crystal, the phonon energy spectrum is continuous, but in a one-dimensional system, like a suspended carbon nanotube, the spectrum is discrete and can be engineered to an extremely low density of states. An individual single-molecule magnet, coupled to a suspended carbon nanotube, should therefore exhibit extremely long relaxation times and the system's reduced size should result in a strong spin&#8211;phonon coupling. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for a strong spin&#8211;phonon coupling between a single molecule spin and a carbon nanotube resonator, ultimately enabling coherent spin manipulation and quantum entanglement.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut Néel, CNRS et Université Joseph Fourier, BP 166, Grenoble Cedex 9, F-38042, France', 'authors': ['Marc Ganzhorn', '\xa0&\xa0Wolfgang Wernsdorfer']}, {'address': 'Institute of Nanotechnology (INT), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, 76344, Germany', 'authors': ['Svetlana Klyatskaya', '\xa0&\xa0Mario Ruben']}, {'address': 'Institut de Physique et Chimie des Matériaux de Strasbourg (IPCMS), CNRS-Université de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, 67034, France', 'authors': ['Mario Ruben']}]",False,"['Marc Ganzhorn', 'Svetlana Klyatskaya', 'Mario Ruben', 'Wolfgang Wernsdorfer']","Ganzhorn, M., Klyatskaya, S., Ruben, M. et al.

letter,Electrical control of single hole spins in nanowire quantum dots,"<p>The development of viable quantum computation devices will require the ability to preserve the coherence of quantum bits (qubits). Single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum information processing, but controlling decoherence remains a considerable challenge. Hole spins in III&#8211;V semiconductors have unique properties, such as a strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction and weak coupling to nuclear spins, and therefore, have the potential for enhanced spin control and longer coherence times. A weaker hyperfine interaction has previously been reported in self-assembled quantum dots using quantum optics techniques, but the development of hole&#8211;spin-based electronic devices in conventional III-V heterostructures has been limited by fabrication challenges. Here, we show that gate-tunable hole quantum dots can be formed in InSb nanowires and used to demonstrate Pauli spin blockade and electrical control of single hole spins. The devices are fully tunable between hole and electron quantum dots, which allows the hyperfine interaction strengths, g-factors and spin blockade anisotropies to be compared directly in the two regimes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, Delft, 2600 GA, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['V.

letter,Three-dimensional optical manipulation of a single electron spin,"<p>Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are promising elemental blocks for quantum optics, spin-based quantum information processing and high-resolution sensing. However, fully exploiting the capabilities of these NV centres requires suitable strategies to accurately manipulate them. Here, we use optical tweezers as a tool to achieve deterministic trapping and three-dimensional spatial manipulation of individual nanodiamonds hosting a single NV spin. Remarkably, we find that the NV axis is nearly fixed inside the trap and can be controlled in situ by adjusting the polarization of the trapping light. By combining this unique spatial and angular control with coherent manipulation of the NV spin and fluorescence lifetime measurements near an integrated photonic system, we demonstrate individual optically trapped NV centres as a novel route for both three-dimensional vectorial magnetometry and sensing of the local density of optical states.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ICFO – Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, Castelldefels (Barcelona), 08860, Spain', 'authors': ['Michael Geiselmann', ',\xa0Mathieu L.

letter,Arrays of single-walled carbon nanotubes with full surface coverage for high-performance electronics,"<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes have exceptional electronic properties and have been proposed as a replacement for silicon in applications such as low-cost thin-film transistors and high-performance logic devices. However, practical devices will require dense, aligned arrays of electronically pure nanotubes to optimize performance, maximize device packing density and provide sufficient drive current (or power output) for each transistor. Here, we show that aligned arrays of semiconducting carbon nanotubes can be assembled using the Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer method. The arrays have a semiconducting nanotube purity of 99% and can fully cover a surface with a nanotube density of more than 500&#160;tubes/&#181;m. The nanotube pitch is self-limited by the diameter of the nanotube plus the van der Waals separation, and the intrinsic mobility of the nanotubes is preserved after array assembly. Transistors fabricated using this approach exhibit significant device performance characteristics with a drive current density of more than 120&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, transconductance greater than 40&#160;&#181;S&#160;&#181;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and on/off ratios of &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup>.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM T.

letter,Biomimetic enzyme nanocomplexes and their use as antidotes and preventive measures for alcohol intoxication,"<p>Organisms have sophisticated subcellular compartments containing enzymes that function in tandem. These confined compartments ensure effective chemical transformation and transport of molecules, and the elimination of toxic metabolic wastes. Creating functional enzyme complexes that are confined in a similar way remains challenging. Here we show that two or more enzymes with complementary functions can be assembled and encapsulated within a thin polymer shell to form enzyme nanocomplexes. These nanocomplexes exhibit improved catalytic efficiency and enhanced stability when compared with free enzymes. Furthermore, the co-localized enzymes display complementary functions, whereby toxic intermediates generated by one enzyme can be promptly eliminated by another enzyme. We show that nanocomplexes containing alcohol oxidase and catalase could reduce blood alcohol levels in intoxicated mice, offering an alternative antidote and prophylactic for alcohol intoxication.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials, Ministry of Education, and Institute of Polymer Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China', 'authors': ['Yang Liu', '\xa0&\xa0Linqi Shi']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, California, 90095, USA', 'authors': ['Yang Liu', ',\xa0Juanjuan Du', ',\xa0Ming Yan', ',\xa0Wei Wei', '\xa0&\xa0Yunfeng Lu']}, {'address': 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, 90095, USA', 'authors': ['Ming Yan']}, {'address': 'Department of Medicine, Keck School of Medicine of USC, University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, California, 90033, USA', 'authors': ['Mo Yin Lau', ',\xa0Jay Hu', ',\xa0Hui Han', '\xa0&\xa0Cheng Ji']}, {'address': 'School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, 90095, USA', 'authors': ['Otto O.

letter,Subcellular control of Rac-GTPase signalling by magnetogenetic manipulation inside living cells,"<p>Many cell functions rely on the coordinated activity of signalling pathways at a subcellular scale. However, there are few tools capable of probing and perturbing signalling networks with a spatial resolution matching the intracellular dimensions of their activity patterns. Here we present a generic magnetogenetic approach based on the self-assembly of signalling complexes on the surface of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles inside living cells. The nanoparticles act as nanoscopic hot spots that can be displaced by magnetic forces and trigger signal transduction pathways that bring about a cell response. We applied this strategy to Rho-GTPases, a set of molecular switches known to regulate cell morphology via complex spatiotemporal patterns of activity. We demonstrate that the nanoparticle-mediated activation of signalling pathways leads to local remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton and to morphological changes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Département de Physique et Institut de Biologie, Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, CNRS UMR 8552, Ecole normale supérieure, Université Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, Paris, France', 'authors': ['F.

article,Spatiotemporal control of microtubule nucleation and assembly using magnetic nanoparticles,"<p>Decisions on the fate of cells and their functions are dictated by the spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular signalling networks. However, techniques to examine the dynamics of these intracellular processes remain limited. Here, we show that magnetic nanoparticles conjugated with key regulatory proteins can artificially control, in time and space, the Ran/RCC1 signalling pathway that regulates the cell cytoskeleton. In the presence of a magnetic field, RanGTP proteins conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles can induce microtubule fibres to assemble into asymmetric arrays of polarized fibres in Xenopus laevis egg extracts. The orientation of the fibres is dictated by the direction of the magnetic force. When we locally concentrated nanoparticles conjugated with the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1, the assembly of microtubule fibres could be induced over a greater range of distances than RanGTP particles. The method shows how bioactive nanoparticles can be used to engineer signalling networks and spatial self-organization inside a cell environment.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Département de Chimie, Ecole Normale Supérieure, UMR 8640 CNRS-ENS-UPMC Pasteur, 24, rue Lhomond, Paris, 75005, France', 'authors': ['Céline Hoffmann', '\xa0&\xa0Zoher Gueroui']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire de Photonique et de Nanostructures, LPN-CNRS, route de Nozay, Marcoussis, 91460, France', 'authors': ['Elsa Mazari', '\xa0&\xa0Charlie Gosse']}, {'address': 'CNRS, UMR 6290, Institut de Génétique et Développement de Rennes, Rennes, F-35043, France', 'authors': ['Sylvie Lallet', '\xa0&\xa0Roland Le Borgne']}, {'address': 'Université Rennes 1, UEB, IFR 140, Faculté de Médecine, Rennes, F-35043, France', 'authors': ['Roland Le Borgne']}, {'address': 'CNRS UMR 6226, Université Rennes 1, Sciences Chimiques de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, Rennes, F-35042, France', 'authors': ['Valérie Marchi']}]",False,"['Céline Hoffmann', 'Elsa Mazari', 'Sylvie Lallet', 'Roland Le Borgne', 'Valérie Marchi', 'Charlie Gosse', 'Zoher Gueroui']","Hoffmann, C., Mazari, E., Lallet, S. et al.

article,Thermal activation of non-radiative Auger recombination in charged colloidal nanocrystals,"<p>Applications of semiconductor nanocrystals such as biomarkers and light-emitting optoelectronic devices require that their fluorescence quantum yield be close to 100%. However, such quantum yields have not been obtained yet, in part, because non-radiative Auger recombination in charged nanocrystals could not be suppressed completely. Here, we synthesize colloidal core/thick-shell CdSe/CdS nanocrystals with 100% quantum yield and completely quenched Auger processes at low temperatures, although the nanocrystals are negatively photocharged. Single particle and ensemble spectroscopy in the temperature range 30&#8211;300&#160;K shows that the non-radiative Auger recombination is thermally activated around 200&#160;K. Experimental results are well described by a model suggesting a temperature-dependent delocalization of one of the trion electrons from the CdSe core and enhanced Auger recombination at the abrupt CdS outer surface. These results point to a route for the design of core/shell structures with 100% quantum yield at room temperature.</p>",,"[{'address': ""Laboratoire de Physique et d'Etude des Matériaux, CNRS, ESPCI, 10 rue Vauquelin, Paris, 75231, France"", 'authors': ['C.

article,On-demand semiconductor single-photon source with near-unity indistinguishability,"<p>Single-photon sources based on semiconductor quantum dots offer distinct advantages for quantum information, including a scalable solid-state platform, ultrabrightness and interconnectivity with matter qubits. A key prerequisite for their use in optical quantum computing and solid-state networks is a high level of efficiency and indistinguishability. Pulsed resonance fluorescence has been anticipated as the optimum condition for the deterministic generation of high-quality photons with vanishing effects of dephasing. Here, we generate pulsed single photons on demand from a single, microcavity-embedded quantum dot under s-shell excitation with 3&#160;ps laser pulses. The &#960; pulse-excited resonance-fluorescence photons have less than 0.3% background contribution and a vanishing two-photon emission probability. Non-postselective Hong&#8211;Ou&#8211;Mandel interference between two successively emitted photons is observed with a visibility of 0.97(2), comparable to trapped atoms and ions. Two single photons are further used to implement a high-fidelity quantum controlled-NOT gate.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China', 'authors': ['Yu-Ming He', ',\xa0Yu He', ',\xa0Yu-Jia Wei', ',\xa0Dian Wu', ',\xa0Mete Atatüre', ',\xa0Chao-Yang Lu', '\xa0&\xa0Jian-Wei Pan']}, {'address': 'Cavendish Laboratory, JJ Thomson Avenue, University of Cambridge, CB3 0HE, Cambridge, UK', 'authors': ['Mete Atatüre', '\xa0&\xa0Chao-Yang Lu']}, {'address': 'Technische Physik, Physikalisches Institut and Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen-Center for Complex Material Systems, Universität Würzburg, Am Hubland, D-97074, Würzburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Christian Schneider', ',\xa0Sven Höfling', '\xa0&\xa0Martin Kamp']}]",False,"['Yu-Ming He', 'Yu He', 'Yu-Jia Wei', 'Dian Wu', 'Mete Atatüre', 'Christian Schneider', 'Sven Höfling', 'Martin Kamp', 'Chao-Yang Lu', 'Jian-Wei Pan']","He, Y., He, Y., Wei, Y. et al.
