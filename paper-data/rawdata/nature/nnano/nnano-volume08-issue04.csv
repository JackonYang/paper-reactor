letter,An autonomous photosynthetic device in which all charge carriers derive from surface plasmons,"<p>Solar conversion to electricity or to fuels based on electron&#8211;hole pair production in semiconductors is a highly evolved scientific and commercial enterprise. Recently, it has been posited that charge carriers either directly transferred from the plasmonic structure to a neighbouring semiconductor (such as TiO<sub>2</sub>) or to a photocatalyst, or induced by energy transfer in a neighbouring medium, could augment photoconversion processes, potentially leading to an entire new paradigm in harvesting photons for practical use. The strong dependence of the wavelength at which the local surface plasmon can be excited on the nanostructure makes it possible, in principle, to design plasmonic devices that can harvest photons over the entire solar spectrum and beyond. So far, however, most such systems show rather small photocatalytic activity in the visible as compared with the ultraviolet. Here, we report an efficient, autonomous solar water-splitting device based on a gold nanorod array in which essentially all charge carriers involved in the oxidation and reduction steps arise from the hot electrons resulting from the excitation of surface plasmons in the nanostructured gold. Each nanorod functions without external wiring, producing 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>13</sup> H<sub>2</sub> molecules per cm<sup>2</sup> per s under 1&#160;sun illumination (AM&#160;1.5 and 100&#160;mW&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>), with unprecedented long-term operational stability.</p>",[],False,"[""Syed Mubeen"", ""Joun Lee"", ""Nirala Singh"", ""Stephan Kr\u00e4mer"", ""Galen D.

letter,An electromechanically reconfigurable plasmonic metamaterial operating in the near-infrared,"<p>Current efforts in metamaterials research focus on attaining dynamic functionalities such as tunability, switching and modulation of electromagnetic waves. To this end, various approaches have emerged, including embedded varactors, phase-change media, the use of liquid crystals, electrical modulation with graphene and superconductors, and carrier injection or depletion in semiconductor substrates. However, tuning, switching and modulating metamaterial properties in the visible and near-infrared range remain major technological challenges: indeed, the existing microelectromechanical solutions used for the sub-terahertz and terahertz regimes cannot be shrunk by two to three orders of magnitude to enter the optical spectral range. Here, we develop a new type of metamaterial operating in the optical part of the spectrum that is three orders of magnitude faster than previously reported electrically reconfigurable metamaterials. The metamaterial is actuated by electrostatic forces arising from the application of only a few volts to its nanoscale building blocks&#8212;the plasmonic metamolecules&#8212;that are supported by pairs of parallel strings cut from a flexible silicon nitride membrane of nanoscale thickness. These strings, of picogram mass, can be driven synchronously to megahertz frequencies to electromechanically reconfigure the metamolecules and dramatically change the transmission and reflection spectra of the metamaterial. The metamaterial's colossal electro-optical response (on the order of 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>&#8211;10<sup>&#8722;6</sup>&#160;m&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) allows for either fast continuous tuning of its optical properties (up to 8% optical signal modulation at up to megahertz rates) or high-contrast irreversible switching in a device only 100&#160;nm thick, without the need for external polarizers and analysers.</p>",[],False,"[""Jun-Yu Ou"", ""Eric Plum"", ""Jianfa Zhang"", ""Nikolay I.

letter,Terahertz spin current pulses controlled by magnetic heterostructures,"<p>In spin-based electronics, information is encoded by the spin state of electron bunches. Processing this information requires the controlled transport of spin angular momentum through a solid, preferably at frequencies reaching the so far unexplored terahertz regime. Here, we demonstrate, by experiment and theory, that the temporal shape of femtosecond spin current bursts can be manipulated by using specifically designed magnetic heterostructures. A laser pulse is used to drive spins from a ferromagnetic iron thin film into a non-magnetic cap layer that has either low (ruthenium) or high (gold) electron mobility. The resulting transient spin current is detected by means of an ultrafast, contactless amperemeter based on the inverse spin Hall effect, which converts the spin flow into a terahertz electromagnetic pulse. We find that the ruthenium cap layer yields a considerably longer spin current pulse because electrons are injected into ruthenium d states, which have a much lower mobility than gold sp states. Thus, spin current pulses and the resulting terahertz transients can be shaped by tailoring magnetic heterostructures, which opens the door to engineering high-speed spintronic devices and, potentially, broadband terahertz emitters.</p>",[],False,"[""T.

letter,Bipolar spin blockade and coherent state superpositions in a triple quantum dot,"<p>Spin qubits based on interacting spins in double quantum dots have been demonstrated successfully. Readout of the qubit state involves a conversion of spin to charge information, which is universally achieved by taking advantage of a spin blockade phenomenon resulting from Pauli's exclusion principle. The archetypal spin blockade transport signature in double quantum dots takes the form of a rectified current. At present, more complex spin qubit circuits including triple quantum dots are being developed. Here we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that in a linear triple quantum dot circuit the spin blockade becomes bipolar with current strongly suppressed in both bias directions and also that a new quantum coherent mechanism becomes relevant. In this mechanism, charge is transferred non-intuitively via coherent states from one end of the linear triple dot circuit to the other, without involving the centre site.

letter,Ferromagnetic dislocations in antiferromagnetic NiO,"<p>Crystal lattice defects often degrade device functionality, but engineering these defects may have value in future electronic and magnetic device applications. For example, dislocations&#8212;one-dimensional lattice defects with locally distinct atomic-scale structures&#8212;exhibit unique and localized electrical properties and can be used as a template for producing conducting nanowires in insulating crystals. It has also been predicted that spin-polarized current may flow along dislocations in topological insulators. Although it is expected that the magnetic properties of dislocations will differ from those of the lattice, their fundamental characterization at the individual level has received little attention. Here, we demonstrate that dislocations in NiO crystals show unique magnetic properties. Magnetic force microscopy imaging clearly reveals ferromagnetic ordering of individual dislocations in antiferromagnetic NiO, originating from the local non-stoichiometry of the dislocation cores. The ferromagnetic dislocations have high coercivity due to their strong interaction with the surrounding antiferromagnetic bulk phase. Although it has already been reported that nanocrystals of rock-salt NiO show ferromagnetic behaviour, our study characterizes the ferromagnetic properties of individual lattice defects. We discuss the origin of the unexpected ferromagnetism in terms of the physical properties of the atomic-scale core structures of single dislocations, and demonstrate that it is possible to fabricate stable nanoscale magnetic elements inside crystalline environments composed of these microstructures.</p>",[],False,"[""Issei Sugiyama"", ""Naoya Shibata"", ""Zhongchang Wang"", ""Shunsuke Kobayashi"", ""Takahisa Yamamoto"", ""Yuichi Ikuhara""]","Sugiyama, I., Shibata, N., Wang, Z. et al.

letter,Orientation of luminescent excitons in layered nanomaterials,"<p>In nanomaterials, optical anisotropies reveal a fundamental relationship between structural and optical properties. Directional optical properties can be exploited to enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices, optomechanical actuators and metamaterials. In layered materials, optical anisotropies may result from in-plane and out-of-plane dipoles associated with intra- and interlayer excitations, respectively. Here, we resolve the orientation of luminescent excitons and isolate photoluminescence signatures arising from distinct intra- and interlayer optical transitions. Combining analytical calculations with energy- and momentum-resolved spectroscopy, we distinguish between in-plane and out-of-plane oriented excitons in materials with weak or strong interlayer coupling&#8212;MoS<sub>2</sub> and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), respectively. We demonstrate that photoluminescence from MoS<sub>2</sub> mono-, bi- and trilayers originates solely from in-plane excitons, whereas PTCDA supports distinct in-plane and out-of-plane exciton species with different spectra, dipole strengths and temporal dynamics. The insights provided by this work are important for understanding fundamental excitonic properties in nanomaterials and designing optical systems that efficiently excite and collect light from exciton species with different orientations.</p>",[],False,"[""Jon A.

letter,Nanowire liquid pumps,"<p>The ability to form tiny droplets of liquids and control their movements is important in printing or patterning, chemical reactions and biological assays. So far, such nanofluidic capabilities have principally used components such as channels, nozzles or tubes, where a solid encloses the transported liquid. Here, we show that liquids can flow along the outer surface of solid nanowires at a scale of attolitres per second and the process can be directly imaged with in situ transmission electron microscopy. Microscopy videos show that an ionic liquid can be pumped along tin dioxide, silicon or zinc oxide nanowires as a thin precursor film or as beads riding on the precursor film. Theoretical analysis suggests there is a critical film thickness of &#8764;10 nm below which the liquid flows as a flat film and above which it flows as discrete beads. This critical thickness is the result of intermolecular forces between solid and liquid, which compete with liquid surface energy and Rayleigh&#8211;Plateau instability.</p>",[],False,"[""Jian Yu Huang"", ""Yu-Chieh Lo"", ""Jun Jie Niu"", ""Akihiro Kushima"", ""Xiaofeng Qian"", ""Li Zhong"", ""Scott X.

article,Large tunable image-charge effects in single-molecule junctions,"<p>Metal/organic interfaces critically determine the characteristics of molecular electronic devices, because they influence the arrangement of the orbital levels that participate in charge transport. Studies on self-assembled monolayers show molecule-dependent energy-level shifts as well as transport-gap renormalization, two effects that suggest that electric-field polarization in the metal substrate induced by the formation of image charges plays a key role in the alignment of the molecular energy levels with respect to the metal's Fermi energy. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence for an electrode-induced gap renormalization in single-molecule junctions. We study charge transport through single porphyrin-type molecules using electrically gateable break junctions. In this set-up, the position of the occupied and unoccupied molecular energy levels can be followed in situ under simultaneous mechanical control. When increasing the electrode separation by just a few &#229;ngstr&#246;ms, we observe a substantial increase in the transport gap and level shifts as high as several hundreds of meV.

article,Multistep protein unfolding during nanopore translocation,"<p>Cells are divided into compartments and separated from the environment by lipid bilayer membranes. Essential molecules are transported back and forth across the membranes. We have investigated how folded proteins use narrow transmembrane pores to move between compartments. During this process, the proteins must unfold. To examine co-translocational unfolding of individual molecules, we tagged protein substrates with oligonucleotides to enable potential-driven unidirectional movement through a model protein nanopore, a process that differs fundamentally from extension during force spectroscopy measurements. Our findings support a four-step translocation mechanism for model thioredoxin substrates. First, the DNA tag is captured by the pore. Second, the oligonucleotide is pulled through the pore, causing local unfolding of the C terminus of the thioredoxin adjacent to the pore entrance. Third, the remainder of the protein unfolds spontaneously. Finally, the unfolded polypeptide diffuses through the pore into the recipient compartment. The unfolding pathway elucidated here differs from those revealed by denaturation experiments in solution, for which two-state mechanisms have been proposed.</p>",[],False,"[""David Rodriguez-Larrea"", ""Hagan Bayley""]","Rodriguez-Larrea, D., Bayley, H.

article,Activation of different split functionalities on re-association of RNA–DNA hybrids,"<p>Split-protein systems, an approach that relies on fragmentation of proteins with their further conditional re-association to form functional complexes, are increasingly used for various biomedical applications. This approach offers tight control of protein functions and improved detection sensitivity. Here we report a similar technique based on a pair of RNA&#8211;DNA hybrids that can be used generally for triggering different split functionalities. Individually, each hybrid is inactive but when two cognate hybrids re-associate, different functionalities are triggered inside mammalian cells. As a proof of concept, this work mainly focuses on the activation of RNA interference. However, the release of other functionalities (such as resonance energy transfer and RNA aptamer) is also shown. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrate a significant uptake of the hybrids by tumours together with specific gene silencing.
