letter,A surface-patterned chip as a strong source of ultracold atoms for quantum technologies,"<p>Laser-cooled atoms are central to modern precision measurements. They are also increasingly important as an enabling technology for experimental cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum information processing and matter&#8211;wave interferometry. Although significant progress has been made in miniaturizing atomic metrological devices, these are limited in accuracy by their use of hot atomic ensembles and buffer gases. Advances have also been made in producing portable apparatus that benefits from the advantages of atoms in the microkelvin regime. However, simplifying atomic cooling and loading using microfabrication technology has proved difficult. In this Letter we address this problem, realizing an atom chip that enables the integration of laser cooling and trapping into a compact apparatus. Our source delivers ten thousand times more atoms than previous magneto-optical traps with microfabricated optics and, for the first time, can reach sub-Doppler temperatures. Moreover, the same chip design offers a simple way to form stable optical lattices. These features, combined with simplicity of fabrication and ease of operation, make these new traps a key advance in the development of cold-atom technology for high-accuracy, portable measurement devices.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

letter,Direct observation and dynamics of spontaneous skyrmion-like magnetic domains in a ferromagnet,"<p>The structure and dynamics of submicrometre magnetic domains are the main factors determining the physical properties of magnetic materials. Here, we report the first observation of skyrmion-like magnetic nanodomains in a ferromagnetic manganite, La<sub>0.5</sub>Ba<sub>0.5</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>, using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM). The skyrmion-like magnetic domains appear as clusters above the Curie temperature. We found that the repeated reversal of magnetic chirality is caused by thermal fluctuation. The closely spaced clusters exhibit dynamic coupling, and the repeated magnetization reversal becomes fully synchronized with the same chirality. Quantitative analysis of such dynamics was performed by LTEM to directly determine the barrier energy for the magnetization reversal of skyrmion-like nanometre domains. This study is expected to pave the way for further investigation of the unresolved nature and dynamics of magnetic vortex-like nanodomains.</p>",[],False,"[""Masahiro Nagao"", ""Yeong-Gi So"", ""Hiroyuki Yoshida"", ""Masaaki Isobe"", ""Toru Hara"", ""Kazuo Ishizuka"", ""Koji Kimoto""]","Nagao, M., So, YG., Yoshida, H. et al.

letter,A nanoscale combing technique for the large-scale assembly of highly aligned nanowires,"<p>The controlled assembly of nanowires is a key challenge in the development of a range of bottom-up devices. Recent advances in the post-growth assembly of nanowires and carbon nanotubes have led to alignment ratios of 80&#8211;95% for a misalignment angle of &#177;5&#176; (refs&#160;) and allowed various multiwire devices to be fabricated. However, these methods still create a significant number of crossing defects, which restricts the development of device arrays and circuits based on single nanowires/nanotubes. Here, we show that a nanocombing assembly technique, in which nanowires are anchored to defined areas of a surface and then drawn out over chemically distinct regions of the surface, can yield arrays with greater than 98.5% of the nanowires aligned to within &#177;1&#176; of the combing direction. The arrays have a crossing defect density of &#8764;0.04 nanowires per &#181;m and efficient end registration at the anchoring/combing interface. With this technique, arrays of single-nanowire devices are tiled over chips and shown to have reproducible electronic properties. We also show that nanocombing can be used for laterally deterministic assembly, to align ultralong (millimetre-scale) nanowires to within &#177;1&#176; and to assemble suspended and crossed nanowire arrays.</p>",[],False,"[""Jun Yao"", ""Hao Yan"", ""Charles M.

letter,A biomimetic nanosponge that absorbs pore-forming toxins,"<p>Detoxification treatments such as toxin-targeted anti-virulence therapy offer ways to cleanse the body of virulence factors that are caused by bacterial infections, venomous injuries and biological weaponry. Because existing detoxification platforms such as antisera, monoclonal antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors and molecularly imprinted polymers act by targeting the molecular structures of toxins, customized treatments are required for different diseases. Here, we show a biomimetic toxin nanosponge that functions as a toxin decoy in vivo. The nanosponge, which consists of a polymeric nanoparticle core surrounded by red blood cell membranes, absorbs membrane-damaging toxins and diverts them away from their cellular targets. In a mouse model, the nanosponges markedly reduce the toxicity of staphylococcal alpha-haemolysin (&#945;-toxin) and thus improve the survival rate of toxin-challenged mice. This biologically inspired toxin nanosponge presents a detoxification treatment that can potentially treat a variety of injuries and diseases caused by pore-forming toxins.</p>",[],False,"[""Che-Ming J.

article,Dynamic switching of the spin circulation in tapered magnetic nanodisks,"<p>Magnetic vortices are characterized by the sense of in-plane magnetization circulation and by the polarity of the vortex core. With each having two possible states, there are four possible stable magnetization configurations that can be utilized for a multibit memory cell. Dynamic control of vortex core polarity has been demonstrated using both alternating and pulsed magnetic fields and currents. Here, we show controlled dynamic switching of spin circulation in vortices using nanosecond field pulses by imaging the process with full-field soft X-ray transmission microscopy. The dynamic reversal process is controlled by far-from-equilibrium gyrotropic precession of the vortex core, and the reversal is achieved at significantly reduced field amplitudes when compared with static switching. We further show that both the field pulse amplitude and duration required for efficient circulation reversal can be controlled by appropriate selection of the disk geometry.</p>",[],False,"[""V.

article,Using nanoscale thermocapillary flows to create arrays of purely semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>Among the remarkable variety of semiconducting nanomaterials that have been discovered over the past two decades, single-walled carbon nanotubes remain uniquely well suited for applications in high-performance electronics, sensors and other technologies. The most advanced opportunities demand the ability to form perfectly aligned, horizontal arrays of purely semiconducting, chemically pristine carbon nanotubes. Here, we present strategies that offer this capability. Nanoscale thermocapillary flows in thin-film organic coatings followed by reactive ion etching serve as highly efficient means for selectively removing metallic carbon nanotubes from electronically heterogeneous aligned arrays grown on quartz substrates. The low temperatures and unusual physics associated with this process enable robust, scalable operation, with clear potential for practical use. We carry out detailed experimental and theoretical studies to reveal all of the essential attributes of the underlying thermophysical phenomena. We demonstrate use of the purified arrays in transistors that achieve mobilities exceeding 1,000&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and on/off switching ratios of &#8764;10,000 with current outputs in the milliamp range.

article,A general method for transferring graphene onto soft surfaces,"<p>Recent advances in chemical vapour deposition have led to the fabrication of large graphene sheets on metal foils for use in research and development. However, further breakthroughs are required in the way these graphenes are transferred from their growth substrates onto the final substrate. Although various methods have been developed, as yet there is no general way to reliably transfer graphene onto arbitrary surfaces, such as &#8216;soft&#8217; ones. Here, we report a method that allows the graphene to be transferred with high fidelity at the desired location on almost all surfaces, including fragile polymer thin films and hydrophobic surfaces. The method relies on a sacrificial &#8216;self-releasing&#8217; polymer layer placed between a conventional polydimethylsiloxane elastomer stamp and the graphene that is to be transferred. This self-releasing layer provides a low work of adhesion on the stamp, which facilitates delamination of the graphene and its placement on the new substrate. To demonstrate the generality and reliability of our method, we fabricate high field-strength polymer capacitors using graphene as the top contact over a polymer dielectric thin film. These capacitors show superior dielectric breakdown characteristics compared with those made with evaporated metal top contacts. Furthermore, we fabricate low-operation-voltage organic field-effect transistors using graphene as the gate electrode placed over a thin polymer gate dielectric layer. We finally demonstrate an artificial graphite intercalation compound by stacking alternate monolayers of graphene and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F<sub>4</sub>TCNQ). This compound, which comprises graphene sheets p-doped by partial hole transfer from the F<sub>4</sub>TCNQ, shows a high and remarkably stable hole conductivity, even when heated in the presence of moisture.</p>",[],False,"[""Jie Song"", ""Fong-Yu Kam"", ""Rui-Qi Png"", ""Wei-Ling Seah"", ""Jing-Mei Zhuo"", ""Geok-Kieng Lim"", ""Peter K.
