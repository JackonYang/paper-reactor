letter,Voltage-controlled domain wall traps in ferromagnetic nanowires,"<p>Electrical control of magnetism has the potential to bring about revolutionary new spintronic devices, many of which rely on efficient manipulation of magnetic domain walls in ferromagnetic nanowires. Recently, it has been shown that voltage-induced charge accumulation at a metal&#8211;oxide interface can influence domain wall motion in ultrathin metallic ferromagnets, but the effects have been relatively modest and limited to the slow, thermally activated regime. Here we show that a voltage can generate non-volatile switching of magnetic properties at the nanoscale by modulating interfacial chemistry rather than charge density. Using a solid-state ionic conductor as a gate dielectric, we generate unprecedentedly strong voltage-controlled domain wall traps that function as non-volatile, electrically programmable and switchable pinning sites. Pinning strengths of at least 650 Oe can be readily achieved, enough to bring to a standstill domain walls travelling at speeds of at least &#8764;20 m s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. We exploit this new magneto-ionic effect to demonstrate a prototype non-volatile memory device in which voltage-controlled domain wall traps facilitate electrical bit selection in a magnetic nanowire register.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Uwe Bauer', ',\xa0Satoru Emori', '\xa0&\xa0Geoffrey S.

letter,Gigahertz quantized charge pumping in graphene quantum dots,"<p>Single-electron pumps are set to revolutionize electrical metrology by enabling the ampere to be redefined in terms of the elementary charge of an electron. Pumps based on lithographically fixed tunnel barriers in mesoscopic metallic systems and normal/superconducting hybrid turnstiles can reach very small error rates, but only at megahertz pumping speeds that correspond to small currents of the order of picoamperes. Tunable barrier pumps in semiconductor structures are operated at gigahertz frequencies, but the theoretical treatment of the error rate is more complex and only approximate predictions are available. Here, we present a monolithic, fixed-barrier single-electron pump made entirely from graphene that performs at frequencies up to several gigahertz. Combined with the record-high accuracy of the quantum Hall effect and proximity-induced Josephson junctions, quantized-current generation brings an all-graphene closure of the quantum metrological triangle within reach. Envisaged applications for graphene charge pumps outside quantum metrology include single-photon generation via electron&#8211;hole recombination in electrostatically doped bilayer graphene reservoirs, single Dirac fermion emission in relativistic electron quantum optics and read-out of spin-based graphene qubits in quantum information processing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Physical Laboratory, Hampton Road, Teddington, TW11 0LW, UK', 'authors': ['M.

letter,A transparent electrode based on a metal nanotrough network,"<p>Transparent conducting electrodes are essential components for numerous flexible optoelectronic devices, including touch screens and interactive electronics. Thin films of indium tin oxide&#8212;the prototypical transparent electrode material&#8212;demonstrate excellent electronic performances, but film brittleness, low infrared transmittance and low abundance limit suitability for certain industrial applications. Alternatives to indium tin oxide have recently been reported and include conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes and graphene. However, although flexibility is greatly improved, the optoelectronic performance of these carbon-based materials is limited by low conductivity. Other examples include metal nanowire-based electrodes, which can achieve sheet resistances of less than 10&#937;&#160;&#9633;<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 90% transmission because of the high conductivity of the metals. To achieve these performances, however, metal nanowires must be defect-free, have conductivities close to their values in bulk, be as long as possible to minimize the number of wire-to-wire junctions, and exhibit small junction resistance. Here, we present a facile fabrication process that allows us to satisfy all these requirements and fabricate a new kind of transparent conducting electrode that exhibits both superior optoelectronic performances (sheet resistance of &#8764;2&#937; &#9633;<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 90% transmission) and remarkable mechanical flexibility under both stretching and bending stresses. The electrode is composed of a free-standing metallic nanotrough network and is produced with a process involving electrospinning and metal deposition. We demonstrate the practical suitability of our transparent conducting electrode by fabricating a flexible touch-screen device and a transparent conducting tape.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, California, 94305, USA', 'authors': ['Hui Wu', ',\xa0Desheng Kong', ',\xa0Po-Chun Hsu', ',\xa0Thomas J.

letter,A general and robust strategy for the synthesis of nearly monodisperse colloidal nanocrystals,"<p>Colloidal nanocrystals exhibit a wide range of size- and shape-dependent properties and have found application in myriad fields, incuding optics, electronics, mechanics, drug delivery and catalysis, to name but a few. Synthetic protocols that enable the simple and convenient production of colloidal nanocrystals with controlled size, shape and composition are therefore of key general importance. Current strategies include organic solution-phase synthesis, thermolysis of organometallic precursors, sol&#8211;gel processes, hydrothermal reactions and biomimetic and dendrimer templating. Often, however, these procedures require stringent experimental conditions, are difficult to generalize, or necessitate tedious multistep reactions and purification. Recently, linear amphiphilic block co-polymer micelles have been used as templates to synthesize functional nanocrystals, but the thermodynamic instability of these micelles limits the scope of this approach. Here, we report a general strategy for crafting a large variety of functional nanocrystals with precisely controlled dimensions, compositions and architectures by using star-like block co-polymers as nanoreactors. This new class of co-polymers forms unimolecular micelles that are structurally stable, therefore overcoming the intrinsic instability of linear block co-polymer micelles. Our approach enables the facile synthesis of organic solvent- and water-soluble nearly monodisperse nanocrystals with desired composition and architecture, including core&#8211;shell and hollow nanostructures. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by describing, as examples, the synthesis of various sizes and architectures of metallic, ferroelectric, magnetic, semiconductor and luminescent colloidal nanocrystals.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, 30332, Georgia, USA', 'authors': ['Xinchang Pang', ',\xa0Lei Zhao', ',\xa0Wei Han', ',\xa0Xukai Xin', '\xa0&\xa0Zhiqun Lin']}]",False,"['Xinchang Pang', 'Lei Zhao', 'Wei Han', 'Xukai Xin', 'Zhiqun Lin']","Pang, X., Zhao, L., Han, W. et al.A general and robust strategy for the synthesis of nearly monodisperse colloidal nanocrystals.

article,Long-distance coherent coupling in a quantum dot array,"<p>Controlling long-distance quantum correlations is central to quantum computation and simulation. In quantum dot arrays, experiments so far rely on nearest-neighbour couplings only, and inducing long-distance correlations requires sequential local operations. Here, we show that two distant sites can be tunnel-coupled directly. The coupling is mediated by virtual occupation of an intermediate site, with a strength that is controlled via the energy detuning of this site. It permits a single charge to oscillate coherently between the outer sites of a triple dot array without passing through the middle, as demonstrated through the observation of Landau&#8211;Zener&#8211;St&#252;ckelberg interference. The long-distance coupling significantly improves the prospects of fault-tolerant quantum computation using quantum dot arrays, and opens up new avenues for performing quantum simulations in nanoscale devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, TU Delft, 2600 GA Delft, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['F.

article,Exchange bias of the interface spin system at the Fe/MgO interface,"<p>The ferromagnet/oxide interface is key to developing emerging multiferroic and spintronic technologies with new functionality. Here we probe the Fe/MgO interface magnetization, and identify a new exchange bias phenomenon manifested only in the interface spin system, and not in the bulk. The interface magnetization exhibits a pronounced exchange bias, and the hysteresis loop is shifted entirely to one side of the zero field axis. However, the bulk magnetization does not, in marked contrast to typical systems where exchange bias is manifested in the net magnetization. This reveals the existence of an antiferromagnetic exchange pinning layer at the interface, identified here as FeO patches that exist even for a nominally &#8216;clean&#8217; interface. These results demonstrate that atomic moments at the interface are non-collinear with the bulk magnetization, and therefore may affect the net anisotropy or serve as spin scattering sites. We control the exchange bias magnitude by varying the interface oxygen concentration and Fe&#8211;O bonding.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Applied Science, College of William and Mary, 251 Jamestown Road, Williamsburg, 23187, Virginia, USA', 'authors': ['Y.

article,Glass-like phonon scattering from a spontaneous nanostructure in AgSbTe2,"<p>Materials with very low thermal conductivity are of great interest for both thermoelectric and optical phase-change applications. Synthetic nanostructuring is most promising for suppressing thermal conductivity through phonon scattering, but challenges remain in producing bulk samples. In crystalline AgSbTe<sub>2</sub> we show that a spontaneously forming nanostructure leads to a suppression of thermal conductivity to a glass-like level. Our mapping of the phonon mean free paths provides a novel bottom-up microscopic account of thermal conductivity and also reveals intrinsic anisotropies associated with the nanostructure. Ground-state degeneracy in AgSbTe<sub>2</sub> leads to the natural formation of nanoscale domains with different orderings on the cation sublattice, and correlated atomic displacements, which efficiently scatter phonons. This mechanism is general and suggests a new avenue for the nanoscale engineering of materials to achieve low thermal conductivities for efficient thermoelectric converters and phase-change memory devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Quantum Condensed Matter Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, 37831, Tennessee, USA', 'authors': ['J.

article,DNA sequencing using electrical conductance measurements of a DNA polymerase,"<p>The development of personalized medicine&#8212;in which medical treatment is customized to an individual on the basis of genetic information&#8212;requires techniques that can sequence DNA quickly and cheaply. Single-molecule sequencing technologies, such as nanopores, can potentially be used to sequence long strands of DNA without labels or amplification, but a viable technique has yet to be established. Here, we show that single DNA molecules can be sequenced by monitoring the electrical conductance of a phi29 DNA polymerase as it incorporates unlabelled nucleotides into a template strand of DNA. The conductance of the polymerase is measured by attaching it to a protein transistor that consists of an antibody molecule (immunoglobulin G) bound to two gold nanoparticles, which are in turn connected to source and drain electrodes. The electrical conductance of the DNA polymerase exhibits well-separated plateaux that are &#8764;3 pA in height. Each plateau corresponds to an individual base and is formed at a rate of &#8764;22 nucleotides per second. Additional spikes appear on top of the plateaux and can be used to discriminate between the four different nucleotides.

article,Two DNA nanomachines map pH changes along intersecting endocytic pathways inside the same cell,"<p>DNA is a versatile scaffold for molecular sensing in living cells, and various cellular applications of DNA nanodevices have been demonstrated. However, the simultaneous use of different DNA nanodevices within the same living cell remains a challenge. Here, we show that two distinct DNA nanomachines can be used simultaneously to map pH gradients along two different but intersecting cellular entry pathways. The two nanomachines, which are molecularly programmed to enter cells via different pathways, can map pH changes within well-defined subcellular environments along both pathways inside the same cell. We applied these nanomachines to probe the pH of early endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, in real time. When delivered either sequentially or simultaneously, both nanomachines localized into and independently captured the pH of the organelles for which they were designed. The successful functioning of DNA nanodevices within living systems has important implications for sensing and therapies in a diverse range of contexts.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Centre for Biological Sciences, TIFR, GKVK, Bellary Road, Bangalore, 560065, India', 'authors': ['Souvik Modi', ',\xa0Sunaina Surana', ',\xa0Saheli Halder', '\xa0&\xa0Yamuna Krishnan']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire de Physique, UMR5588 CNRS-Université Grenoble I, Grenoble, France', 'authors': ['Clément Nizak']}]",False,"['Souvik Modi', 'Clément Nizak', 'Sunaina Surana', 'Saheli Halder', 'Yamuna Krishnan']","Modi, S., Nizak, C., Surana, S. et al.
