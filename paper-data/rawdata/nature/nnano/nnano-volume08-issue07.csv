letter,Readout and control of a single nuclear spin with a metastable electron spin ancilla,"<p>Electron and nuclear spins associated with point defects in insulators are promising systems for solid-state quantum technology. The electron spin is usually used for readout and addressing, and nuclear spins are used as exquisite quantum bits and memory systems. With these systems, single-shot readout of single nuclear spins as well as entanglement, aided by the electron spin, have been shown. Although the electron spin in this example is essential for readout, it usually limits the nuclear spin coherence, leading to a quest for defects with spin-free ground states. Here, we isolate a hitherto unidentified defect in diamond and use it at room temperature to demonstrate optical spin polarization and readout with exceptionally high contrast (up to 45%), coherent manipulation of an individual excited triplet state spin, and coherent nuclear spin manipulation using the triplet electron spin as a metastable ancilla. We demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance and Rabi oscillations of the uncoupled nuclear spin in the spin-free electronic ground state. Our study demonstrates that nuclei coupled to single metastable electron spins are useful quantum systems with long memory times, in spite of electronic relaxation processes.</p>",[],False,"[""Sang-Yun Lee"", ""Matthias Widmann"", ""Torsten Rendler"", ""Marcus W.

letter,Ultrasensitive force detection with a nanotube mechanical resonator,"<p>Since the advent of atomic force microscopy, mechanical resonators have been used to study a wide variety of phenomena, including the dynamics of individual electron spins, persistent currents in normal metal rings and the Casimir force. Key to these experiments is the ability to measure weak forces. Here, we report on force sensing experiments with a sensitivity of 12&#160;zN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> at a temperature of 1.2&#160;K using a resonator made of a carbon nanotube. An ultrasensitive method based on cross-correlated electrical noise measurements, in combination with parametric downconversion, is used to detect the low-amplitude vibrations of the nanotube induced by weak forces. The force sensitivity is quantified by applying a known capacitive force. This detection method also allows us to measure the Brownian vibrations of the nanotube down to cryogenic temperatures. Force sensing with nanotube resonators offers new opportunities for detecting and manipulating individual nuclear spins as well as for magnetometry measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""J. Moser"", ""J.

letter,Ultrasensitive photodetectors based on monolayer MoS2,"<p>Two-dimensional materials are an emerging class of new materials with a wide range of electrical properties and potential practical applications. Although graphene is the most well-studied two-dimensional material, single layers of other materials, such as insulating BN (ref.&#160;) and semiconducting MoS<sub>2</sub> (refs&#160;) or WSe<sub>2</sub> (refs&#160;), are gaining increasing attention as promising gate insulators and channel materials for field-effect transistors. Because monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> is a direct-bandgap semiconductor due to quantum-mechanical confinement, it could be suitable for applications in optoelectronic devices where the direct bandgap would allow a high absorption coefficient and efficient electron&#8211;hole pair generation under photoexcitation. Here, we demonstrate ultrasensitive monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> phototransistors with improved device mobility and ON current. Our devices show a maximum external photoresponsivity of 880&#160;A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at a wavelength of 561&#160;nm and a photoresponse in the 400&#8211;680&#160;nm range.

letter,"Bright, long-lived and coherent excitons in carbon nanotube quantum dots","<p>Carbon nanotubes exhibit a wealth of unique physical properties. By virtue of their exceptionally low mass and extreme stiffness they provide ultrahigh-quality mechanical resonances, promise long electron spin coherence times in a nuclear-spin free lattice for quantum information processing and spintronics, and feature unprecedented tunability of optical transitions for optoelectronic applications. Excitons in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes could facilitate the upconversion of spin, mechanical or hybrid spin&#8211;mechanical degrees of freedom to optical frequencies for efficient manipulation and detection. However, successful implementation of such schemes with carbon nanotubes has been impeded by rapid exciton decoherence at non-radiative quenching sites, environmental dephasing and emission intermittence. Here we demonstrate that these limitations may be overcome by exciton localization in suspended carbon nanotubes. For excitons localized in nanotube quantum dots we found narrow optical lines free of spectral wandering, radiative exciton lifetimes and effectively suppressed blinking. Our findings identify the great potential of localized excitons for efficient and spectrally precise interfacing of photons, phonons and spins in novel carbon nanotube-based quantum devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Matthias S.

letter,Lasing action in strongly coupled plasmonic nanocavity arrays,"<p>Periodic dielectric structures are typically integrated with a planar waveguide to create photonic band-edge modes for feedback in one-dimensional distributed feedback lasers and two-dimensional photonic-crystal lasers. Although photonic band-edge lasers are widely used in optics and biological applications, drawbacks include low modulation speeds and diffraction-limited mode confinement. In contrast, plasmonic nanolasers can support ultrafast dynamics and ultrasmall mode volumes. However, because of the large momentum mismatch between their nanolocalized lasing fields and free-space light, they suffer from large radiative losses and lack beam directionality. Here, we report lasing action from band-edge lattice plasmons in arrays of plasmonic nanocavities in a homogeneous dielectric environment. We find that optically pumped, two-dimensional arrays of plasmonic Au or Ag nanoparticles surrounded by an organic gain medium show directional beam emission (divergence angle &lt;1.5&#176; and linewidth &lt;1.3&#160;nm) characteristic of lasing action in the far-field, and behave as arrays of nanoscale light sources in the near-field. Using a semi-quantum electromagnetic approach to simulate the active optical responses, we show that lasing is achieved through stimulated energy transfer from the gain to the band-edge lattice plasmons in the deep subwavelength vicinity of the individual nanoparticles. Using femtosecond-transient absorption spectroscopy, we verified that lattice plasmons in plasmonic nanoparticle arrays could reach a 200-fold enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of the dye because of their large local density of optical states.</p>",[],False,"[""Wei Zhou"", ""Montacer Dridi"", ""Jae Yong Suh"", ""Chul Hoon Kim"", ""Dick T.

letter,A plasmonic 'antenna-in-box' platform for enhanced single-molecule analysis at micromolar concentrations,"<p>Single-molecule fluorescence techniques are key for a number of applications, including DNA sequencing, molecular and cell biology and early diagnosis. Unfortunately, observation of single molecules by diffraction-limited optics is restricted to detection volumes in the femtolitre range and requires pico- or nanomolar concentrations, far below the micromolar range where most biological reactions occur. This limitation can be overcome using plasmonic nanostructures, which enable the confinement of light down to nanoscale volumes. Although these nanoantennas enhance fluorescence brightness, large background signals and/or unspecific binding to the metallic surface have hampered the detection of individual fluorescent molecules in solution at high concentrations. Here we introduce a novel &#8216;antenna-in-box&#8217; platform that is based on a gap-antenna inside a nanoaperture. This design combines fluorescent signal enhancement and background screening, offering high single-molecule sensitivity (fluorescence enhancement up to 1,100-fold and microsecond transit times) at micromolar sample concentrations and zeptolitre-range detection volumes. The antenna-in-box device can be optimized for single-molecule fluorescence studies at physiologically relevant concentrations, as we demonstrate using various biomolecules.</p>",[],False,"[""Deep Punj"", ""Mathieu Mivelle"", ""Satish Babu Moparthi"", ""Thomas S. van Zanten"", ""Herv\u00e9 Rigneault"", ""Niek F. van Hulst"", ""Mar\u00eda F.

letter,Silicon chips detect intracellular pressure changes in living cells,"<p>The ability to measure pressure changes inside different components of a living cell is important, because it offers an alternative way to study fundamental processes that involve cell deformation. Most current techniques such as pipette aspiration, optical interferometry or external pressure probes use either indirect measurement methods or approaches that can damage the cell membrane. Here we show that a silicon chip small enough to be internalized into a living cell can be used to detect pressure changes inside the cell. The chip, which consists of two membranes separated by a vacuum gap to form a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonator, detects pressure changes that can be quantified from the intensity of the reflected light.

letter,Rapid detection of bacterial resistance to antibiotics using AFM cantilevers as nanomechanical sensors,"<p>The widespread misuse of drugs has increased the number of multiresistant bacteria, and this means that tools that can rapidly detect and characterize bacterial response to antibiotics are much needed in the management of infections. Various techniques, such as the resazurin-reduction assays, the mycobacterial growth indicator tube or polymerase chain reaction-based methods, have been used to investigate bacterial metabolism and its response to drugs. However, many are relatively expensive or unable to distinguish between living and dead bacteria. Here we show that the fluctuations of highly sensitive atomic force microscope cantilevers can be used to detect low concentrations of bacteria, characterize their metabolism and quantitatively screen (within minutes) their response to antibiotics. We applied this methodology to Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, showing that live bacteria produced larger cantilever fluctuations than bacteria exposed to antibiotics.

article,Chiral spin torque at magnetic domain walls,"<p>Spin-polarized currents provide a powerful means of manipulating the magnetization of nanodevices, and give rise to spin transfer torques that can drive magnetic domain walls along nanowires. In ultrathin magnetic wires, domain walls are found to move in the opposite direction to that expected from bulk spin transfer torques, and also at much higher speeds. Here we show that this is due to two intertwined phenomena, both derived from spin&#8211;orbit interactions. By measuring the influence of magnetic fields on current-driven domain-wall motion in perpendicularly magnetized Co/Ni/Co trilayers, we find an internal effective magnetic field acting on each domain wall, the direction of which alternates between successive domain walls. This chiral effective field arises from a Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction at the Co/Pt interfaces and, in concert with spin Hall currents, drives the domain walls in lock-step along the nanowire. Elucidating the mechanism for the manipulation of domain walls in ultrathin magnetic films will enable the development of new families of spintronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Kwang-Su Ryu"", ""Luc Thomas"", ""See-Hun Yang"", ""Stuart Parkin""]","Ryu, KS., Thomas, L., Yang, SH. et al.

However, the observation of ballistic heat transport at room temperature is challenging because of the short phonon mean free path. Here we show that ballistic thermal conduction persisting over 8.3 &#181;m can be observed in SiGe nanowires with low thermal conductivity for a wide range of structural variations and alloy concentrations. We find that an unexpectedly low percentage (&#8764;0.04%) of phonons carry out the heat conduction process in SiGe nanowires, and that the ballistic phonons display properties including non-additive thermal resistances in series, unconventional contact thermal resistance, and unusual robustness against external perturbations.
