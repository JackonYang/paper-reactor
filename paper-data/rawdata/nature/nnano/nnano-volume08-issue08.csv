letter,Observation of Dirac plasmons in a topological insulator,"<p>Plasmons are quantized collective oscillations of electrons and have been observed in metals and doped semiconductors. The plasmons of ordinary, massive electrons have been the basic ingredients of research in plasmonics and in optical metamaterials for a long time. However, plasmons of massless Dirac electrons have only recently been observed in graphene, a purely two-dimensional electron system. Their properties are promising for novel tunable plasmonic metamaterials in the terahertz and mid-infrared frequency range. Dirac fermions also occur in the two-dimensional electron gas that forms at the surface of topological insulators as a result of the strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction existing in the insulating bulk phase. One may therefore look for their collective excitations using infrared spectroscopy. Here we report the first experimental evidence of plasmonic excitations in a topological insulator (Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>). The material was prepared in thin micro-ribbon arrays of different widths W and periods 2W to select suitable values of the plasmon wavevector k. The linewidth of the plasmon was found to remain nearly constant at temperatures between 6&#160;K and 300&#160;K, as expected when exciting topological carriers. Moreover, by changing W and measuring the plasmon frequency in the terahertz range versus k we show, without using any fitting parameter, that the dispersion curve agrees quantitatively with that predicted for Dirac plasmons.</p>",,"[{'address': 'CNR–SPIN, Corso F.

letter,Atomic clock transitions in silicon-based spin qubits,"<p>A major challenge in using spins in the solid state for quantum technologies is protecting them from sources of decoherence. This is particularly important in nanodevices where the proximity of material interfaces, and their associated defects, can play a limiting role. Spin decoherence can be addressed to varying degrees by improving material purity or isotopic composition, for example, or active error correction methods such as dynamic decoupling (or even combinations of the two). However, a powerful method applied to trapped ions in the context of atomic clocks is the use of particular spin transitions that are inherently robust to external perturbations. Here, we show that such &#8216;clock transitions&#8217; can be observed for electron spins in the solid state, in particular using bismuth donors in silicon. This leads to dramatic enhancements in the electron spin coherence time, exceeding seconds. We find that electron spin qubits based on clock transitions become less sensitive to the local magnetic environment, including the presence of <sup>29</sup>Si nuclear spins as found in natural silicon. We expect the use of such clock transitions will be of additional significance for donor spins in nanodevices, mitigating the effects of magnetic or electric field noise arising from nearby interfaces and gates.</p>",,"[{'address': 'London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London, London, WC1H 0AH, UK', 'authors': ['Gary Wolfowicz', ',\xa0Richard E.

letter,A valley–spin qubit in a carbon nanotube,"<p>Although electron spins in III&#8211;V semiconductor quantum dots have shown great promise as qubits, hyperfine decoherence remains a major challenge in these materials. Group IV semiconductors possess dominant nuclear species that are spinless, allowing qubit coherence times up to 2&#160;s. In carbon nanotubes, where the spin&#8211;orbit interaction allows for all-electrical qubit manipulation, theoretical predictions of the coherence time vary by at least six orders of magnitude and range up to 10&#160;s or more. Here, we realize a qubit encoded in two nanotube valley&#8211;spin states, with coherent manipulation via electrically driven spin resonance mediated by a bend in the nanotube. Readout uses Pauli blockade leakage current through a double quantum dot. Arbitrary qubit rotations are demonstrated and the coherence time is measured for the first time via Hahn echo, allowing comparison with theoretical predictions. The coherence time is found to be &#8764;65 ns, probably limited by electrical noise. This shows that, even with low nuclear spin abundance, coherence can be strongly degraded if the qubit states are coupled to electric fields.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, Delft, 2600 GA, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['E.

letter,Realization of pristine and locally tunable one-dimensional electron systems in carbon nanotubes,"<p>The ability to tune local parameters of quantum Hamiltonians has been demonstrated in experimental systems including ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting circuits and photonic crystals. Such systems possess negligible disorder, enabling local tunability. Conversely, in condensed-matter systems, electrons are subject to disorder, which often destroys delicate correlated phases and precludes local tunability. The realization of a disorder-free and locally-tunable condensed-matter system thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new technique for deterministic creation of locally-tunable, ultralow-disorder electron systems in carbon nanotubes suspended over complex electronic circuits. Using transport experiments we show that electrons can be localized at any position along the nanotube and that the confinement potential can be smoothly moved from location to location. The high mirror symmetry of transport characteristics about the nanotube centre establishes the negligible effects of electronic disorder, thus allowing experiments in precision-engineered one-dimensional potentials. We further demonstrate the ability to position multiple nanotubes at chosen separations, generalizing these devices to coupled one-dimensional systems. These capabilities could enable many novel experiments on electronics, mechanics and spins in one dimension.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Switching of a coupled spin pair in a single-molecule junction,"<p>Single-molecule spintronics investigates electron transport through magnetic molecules that have an internal spin degree of freedom. To understand and control these individual molecules it is important to read their spin state. For unpaired spins, the Kondo effect has been observed as a low-temperature anomaly at small voltages. Here, we show that a coupled spin pair in a single magnetic molecule can be detected and that a bias voltage can be used to switch between two states of the molecule. In particular, we use the mechanically controlled break-junction technique to measure electronic transport through a single-molecule junction containing two coupled spin centres that are confined on two Co<sup>2+</sup> ions. Spin&#8211;orbit configuration interaction methods are used to calculate the combined spin system, where the ground state is found to be a pseudo-singlet and the first excitations behave as a pseudo-triplet. Experimentally, these states can be assigned to the absence and occurrence of a Kondo-like zero-bias anomaly in the low-temperature conductance data, respectively. By applying finite bias, we can repeatedly switch between the pseudo-singlet state and the pseudo-triplet state.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Lehrstuhl für Angewandte Physik, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Staudtstrasse 7, Erlangen, D-91058, Germany', 'authors': ['Stefan Wagner', ',\xa0Ferdinand Kisslinger', ',\xa0Stefan Ballmann', ',\xa0Daniel Secker', '\xa0&\xa0Heiko B.

article,Symmetry and magnitude of spin–orbit torques in ferromagnetic heterostructures,"<p>Recent demonstrations of magnetization switching induced by in-plane current injection in heavy metal/ferromagnetic heterostructures have drawn increasing attention to spin torques based on orbital-to-spin momentum transfer. The symmetry, magnitude and origin of spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs), however, remain a matter of debate. Here we report on the three-dimensional vector measurement of SOTs in AlO<sub>x</sub>/Co/Pt and MgO/CoFeB/Ta trilayers using harmonic analysis of the anomalous and planar Hall effects. We provide a general scheme to measure the amplitude and direction of SOTs as a function of the magnetization direction. Based on space and time inversion symmetry arguments, we demonstrate that heavy metal/ferromagnetic layers allow for two different SOTs having odd and even behaviour with respect to magnetization reversal. Such torques include strongly anisotropic field-like and spin transfer-like components, which depend on the type of heavy metal layer and annealing treatment. These results call for SOT models that go beyond the spin Hall and Rashba effects investigated thus far.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2), Barcelona, E-08193, Spain', 'authors': ['Kevin Garello', ',\xa0Can Onur Avci', '\xa0&\xa0Pietro Gambardella']}, {'address': 'SPINTEC, UMR-8191, CEA/CNRS/UJF/GINP, INAC, Grenoble, F-38054, France', 'authors': ['Ioan Mihai Miron', ',\xa0Stéphane Auffret', ',\xa0Olivier Boulle', '\xa0&\xa0Gilles Gaudin']}, {'address': 'Peter Grünberg Institut and Institute for Advanced Simulation, Forschungszentrum Jülich and JARA, Jülich, 52425, Germany', 'authors': ['Frank Freimuth', ',\xa0Yuriy Mokrousov', '\xa0&\xa0Stefan Blügel']}, {'address': 'Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), Barcelona, E-08010, Spain', 'authors': ['Pietro Gambardella']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials, ETH Zurich, Zurich, CH-8093, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Pietro Gambardella']}]",False,"['Kevin Garello', 'Ioan Mihai Miron', 'Can Onur Avci', 'Frank Freimuth', 'Yuriy Mokrousov', 'Stefan Blügel', 'Stéphane Auffret', 'Olivier Boulle', 'Gilles Gaudin', 'Pietro Gambardella']","Garello, K., Miron, I., Avci, C. et al.

article,Destructive extraction of phospholipids from Escherichia coli membranes by graphene nanosheets,"<p>Understanding how nanomaterials interact with cell membranes is related to how they cause cytotoxicity and is therefore critical for designing safer biomedical applications. Recently, graphene (a two-dimensional nanomaterial) was shown to have antibacterial activity on Escherichia coli, but its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show experimentally and theoretically that pristine graphene and graphene oxide nanosheets can induce the degradation of the inner and outer cell membranes of Escherichia coli, and reduce their viability. Transmission electron microscopy shows three rough stages, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the atomic details of the process. Graphene nanosheets can penetrate into and extract large amounts of phospholipids from the cell membranes because of the strong dispersion interactions between graphene and lipid molecules.

However, it is known that macromolecular crowding, a key feature in natural cells, can dramatically influence biochemical kinetics via volume exclusion effects, which reduce diffusion rates and enhance binding rates of macromolecules. Here, we demonstrate that macromolecular crowding can increase the robustness of gene expression by integrating synthetic cellular components of biological circuits and artificial cellular nanosystems. Furthermore, we reveal how ubiquitous cellular modules, including genetic components, a negative feedback loop and the size of the crowding molecules can fine-tune gene circuit response to molecular crowding. By bridging a key gap between artificial and living cells, our work has implications for efficient and robust control of both synthetic and natural cellular circuits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Lane Center for Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, Pennsylvania, USA', 'authors': ['Cheemeng Tan', ',\xa0Russell Schwartz', '\xa0&\xa0Philip LeDuc']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, Pennsylvania, USA', 'authors': ['Saumya Saurabh', '\xa0&\xa0Marcel P.
