letter,Optical generation of excitonic valley coherence in monolayer WSe2,"<p>As a consequence of degeneracies arising from crystal symmetries, it is possible for electron states at band-edges (&#8216;valleys&#8217;) to have additional spin-like quantum numbers. An important question is whether coherent manipulation can be performed on such valley pseudospins, analogous to that implemented using true spin, in the quest for quantum technologies. Here, we show that valley coherence can be generated and detected. Because excitons in a single valley emit circularly polarized photons, linear polarization can only be generated through recombination of an exciton in a coherent superposition of the two valley states. Using monolayer semiconductor WSe<sub>2</sub> devices, we first establish the circularly polarized optical selection rules for addressing individual valley excitons and trions. We then demonstrate coherence between valley excitons through the observation of linearly polarized luminescence, whose orientation coincides with that of the linearly polarized excitation, for any given polarization angle. In contrast, the corresponding photoluminescence from trions is not observed to be linearly polarized, consistent with the expectation that the emitted photon polarization is entangled with valley pseudospin. The ability to address coherence, in addition to valley polarization, is a step forward towards achieving quantum manipulation of the valley index necessary for coherent valleytronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Aaron M.

letter,A scanning superconducting quantum interference device with single electron spin sensitivity,"<p>Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) can be used to detect weak magnetic fields and have traditionally been the most sensitive magnetometers available. However, because of their relatively large effective size (on the order of 1&#160;&#181;m), the devices have so far been unable to achieve the level of sensitivity required to detect the field generated by the spin magnetic moment (&#956;<sub>B</sub>) of a single electron. Here we show that nanoscale SQUIDs with diameters as small as 46&#160;nm can be fabricated on the apex of a sharp tip. The nano-SQUIDs have an extremely low flux noise of 50&#160;n&#934;<sub>0</sub>&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> and a spin sensitivity of down to 0.38&#160;&#956;<sub>B</sub>&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>, which is almost two orders of magnitude better than previous devices. They can also operate over a wide range of magnetic fields, providing a sensitivity of 0.6&#160;&#956;<sub>B</sub>&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> at 1&#160;T. The unique geometry of our nano-SQUIDs makes them well suited to scanning probe microscopy, and we use the devices to image vortices in a type II superconductor, spaced 120&#160;nm apart, and to record magnetic fields due to alternating currents down to 50&#160;nT.</p>",[],False,"[""Denis Vasyukov"", ""Yonathan Anahory"", ""Lior Embon"", ""Dorri Halbertal"", ""Jo Cuppens"", ""Lior Neeman"", ""Amit Finkler"", ""Yehonathan Segev"", ""Yuri Myasoedov"", ""Michael L.

letter,A current-driven single-atom memory,"<p>The possibility of fabricating electronic devices with functional building blocks of atomic size is a major driving force of nanotechnology. The key elements in electronic circuits are switches, usually realized by transistors, which can be configured to perform memory operations. Electronic switches have been miniaturized all the way down to the atomic scale. However, at such scales, three-terminal devices are technically challenging to implement. Here we show that a metallic atomic-scale contact can be operated as a reliable and fatigue-resistant two-terminal switch. We apply a careful electromigration protocol to toggle the conductance of an aluminium atomic contact between two well-defined values in the range of a few conductance quanta. Using the nonlinearities of the current&#8211;voltage characteristics caused by superconductivity in combination with molecular dynamics and quantum transport calculations, we provide evidence that the switching process is caused by the reversible rearrangement of single atoms. Owing to its hysteretic behaviour with two distinct states, this two-terminal switch can be used as a non-volatile information storage element.</p>",[],False,"[""C. Schirm"", ""M. Matt"", ""F.

letter,Luminescence upconversion in colloidal double quantum dots,"<p>Luminescence upconversion nanocrystals capable of converting two low-energy photons into a single photon at a higher energy are sought-after for a variety of applications, including bioimaging and photovoltaic light harvesting. Currently available systems, based on rare-earth-doped dielectrics, are limited in both tunability and absorption cross-section. Here we present colloidal double quantum dots as an alternative nanocrystalline upconversion system, combining the stability of an inorganic crystalline structure with the spectral tunability afforded by quantum confinement. By tailoring its composition and morphology, we form a semiconducting nanostructure in which excited electrons are delocalized over the entire structure, but a double potential well is formed for holes. Upconversion occurs by excitation of an electron in the lower energy transition, followed by intraband absorption of the hole, allowing it to cross the barrier to a higher energy state. An overall conversion efficiency of 0.1% per double excitation event is achieved.</p>",[],False,"[""Zvicka Deutsch"", ""Lior Neeman"", ""Dan Oron""]","Deutsch, Z., Neeman, L. & Oron, D.

article,Self-consistent measurement and state tomography of an exchange-only spin qubit,"<p>Quantum-dot spin qubits characteristically use oscillating magnetic or electric fields, or quasi-static Zeeman field gradients, to realize full qubit control. For the case of three confined electrons, exchange interaction between two pairs allows qubit rotation around two axes, hence full control, using only electrostatic gates. Here, we report initialization, full control, and single-shot readout of a three-electron exchange-driven spin qubit. Control via the exchange interaction is fast, yielding a demonstrated 75 qubit rotations in less than 2&#160;ns. Measurement and state tomography are performed using a maximum-likelihood estimator method, allowing decoherence, leakage out of the qubit state space, and measurement fidelity to be quantified.

article,Flow-based solution–liquid–solid nanowire synthesis,"<p>Discovered almost two decades ago, the solution&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid (SLS) method for semiconductor nanowire synthesis has proven to be an important route to high-quality, single-crystalline anisotropic nanomaterials. In execution, the SLS technique is similar to colloidal quantum-dot synthesis in that it entails the injection of chemical precursors into a hot surfactant solution, but mechanistically it is considered the solution-phase analogue to vapour&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid (VLS) growth. Both SLS and VLS methods make use of molten metal nanoparticles to catalyse the nucleation and elongation of single-crystalline nanowires. Significantly, however, the methods differ in how chemical precursors are introduced to the metal catalysts. In SLS, precursors are added in a one-off fashion in a flask, whereas in VLS they are carried by a flow of gas through the reaction chamber, and by-products are removed similarly. The ability to dynamically control the introduction of reactants and removal of by-products in VLS synthesis has enabled a degree of synthetic control not possible with SLS growth. We show here that SLS synthesis can be transformed into a continuous technique using a microfluidic reactor. The resulting flow-based SLS (&#8216;flow-SLS&#8217;) platform allows us to slow down the synthesis of nanowires and capture mechanistic details concerning their growth in the solution phase, as well as synthesize technologically relevant axially heterostructured semiconductor nanowires, while maintaining the propensity of SLS for accessing ultrasmall diameters below 10&#160;nm.</p>",[],False,"[""Rawiwan Laocharoensuk"", ""Kumaranand Palaniappan"", ""Nickolaus A.

article,Hierarchical patterns of three-dimensional block-copolymer films formed by electrohydrodynamic jet printing and self-assembly,"<p>Self-assembly of block-copolymers provides a route to the fabrication of small (size, &lt;50 nm) and dense (pitch, &lt;100 nm) features with an accuracy that approaches even the demanding specifications for nanomanufacturing set by the semiconductor industry. A key requirement for practical applications, however, is a rapid, high-resolution method for patterning block-copolymers with different molecular weights and compositions across a wafer surface, with complex geometries and diverse feature sizes. Here we demonstrate that an ultrahigh-resolution jet printing technique that exploits electrohydrodynamic effects can pattern large areas with block-copolymers based on poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate) with various molecular weights and compositions. The printed geometries have diameters and linewidths in the sub-500 nm range, line edge roughness as small as &#8764;45 nm, and thickness uniformity and repeatability that can approach molecular length scales (&#8764;2 nm). Upon thermal annealing on bare, or chemically or topographically structured substrates, such printed patterns yield nanodomains of block-copolymers with well-defined sizes, periodicities and morphologies, in overall layouts that span dimensions from the scale of nanometres (with sizes continuously tunable between 13 nm and 20 nm) to centimetres. As well as its engineering relevance, this methodology enables systematic studies of unusual behaviours of block-copolymers in geometrically confined films.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

article,Geometric curvature controls the chemical patchiness and self-assembly of nanoparticles,"<p>When organic molecules are tethered onto non-spherical nanoparticles, their chemical properties depend on the particles&#8217; local curvature and shape. Based on this observation, we show here that it is possible to engineer chemical patchiness across the surface of a non-spherical nanoparticle using a single chemical species. In particular, when acidic ligands are used, regions of the particle surface with different curvature become charged at different pH values of the surrounding solution. This interplay between particle shape and local electrostatics allows for fine control over nanoscale self-assembly leading to structures with varying degrees of complexity. These structures range from particle cross-stacks to open-lattice crystals, the latter with pore sizes on the order of tens of nanometres, that is, at the lower synthetic limits of metallic mesoporous materials.</p>",[],False,"[""David A.
