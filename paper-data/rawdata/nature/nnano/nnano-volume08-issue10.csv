letter,Quantum interference in plasmonic circuits,"<p>Surface plasmon polaritons (plasmons) are a combination of light and a collective oscillation of the free electron plasma at metal/dielectric interfaces. This interaction allows subwavelength confinement of light beyond the diffraction limit inherent to dielectric structures. As a result, the intensity of the electromagnetic field is enhanced, with the possibility to increase the strength of the optical interactions between waveguides, light sources and detectors. Plasmons maintain non-classical photon statistics and preserve entanglement upon transmission through thin, patterned metallic films or weakly confining waveguides. For quantum applications, it is essential that plasmons behave as indistinguishable quantum particles. Here we report on a quantum interference experiment in a nanoscale plasmonic circuit consisting of an on-chip plasmon beamsplitter with integrated superconducting single-photon detectors to allow efficient single plasmon detection. We demonstrate a quantum-mechanical interaction between pairs of indistinguishable surface plasmons by observing Hong&#8211;Ou&#8211;Mandel (HOM) interference, a hallmark non-classical interference effect that is the basis of linear optics-based quantum computation. Our work shows that it is feasible to shrink quantum optical experiments to the nanoscale and offers a promising route towards subwavelength quantum optical networks.</p>",[],False,"[""Reinier W.

letter,Towards control of the size and helicity of skyrmions in helimagnetic alloys by spin–orbit coupling,"<p>Chirality&#8212;that is, left- or right-handedness&#8212;is an important concept in a broad range of scientific areas. In condensed matter, chirality is found not only in molecular or crystal forms, but also in magnetic structures. A magnetic skyrmion is a topologically stable spin vortex structure, as observed in chiral-lattice helimagnets, and is one example of such a structure. The spin swirling direction (skyrmion helicity) should be closely related to the underlying lattice chirality via the relativistic spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Here, we report on the correlation between skyrmion helicity and crystal chirality in alloys of helimagnets Mn<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>Ge with varying compositions by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and convergent-beam electron diffraction over a broad range of compositions (x&#160;=&#160;0.3&#8211;1.0). The skyrmion lattice constant shows non-monotonous variation with composition x, with a divergent behaviour around x&#160;=&#160;0.8, where the correlation between magnetic helicity and crystal chirality changes sign. This originates from continuous variation of the spin&#8211;orbit coupling strength and its sign reversal in the metallic alloys as a function of x. Controllable spin&#8211;orbit coupling may offer a promising way to tune skyrmion size and helicity.</p>",[],False,"[""K. Shibata"", ""X. Z. Yu"", ""T. Hara"", ""D. Morikawa"", ""N. Kanazawa"", ""K.

letter,Single-nanocrystal sensitivity achieved by enhanced upconversion luminescence,"<p>Upconversion nanocrystals convert infrared radiation to visible luminescence, and are promising for applications in biodetection, bioimaging, solar cells and three-dimensional display technologies. Although the design of suitable nanocrystals has improved the performance of upconversion nanocrystals, their emission brightness is limited by the low doping concentration of activator ions needed to avoid the luminescence quenching that occurs at high concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that high excitation irradiance can alleviate concentration quenching in upconversion luminescence when combined with higher activator concentration, which can be increased from 0.5&#160;mol% to 8&#160;mol% Tm<sup>3+</sup> in NaYF<sub>4</sub>. This leads to significantly enhanced luminescence signals, by up to a factor of 70. By using such bright nanocrystals, we demonstrate remote tracking of a single nanocrystal with a microstructured optical-fibre dip sensor. This represents a sensitivity improvement of three orders of magnitude over benchmark nanocrystals such as quantum dots.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiangbo Zhao"", ""Dayong Jin"", ""Erik P.

letter,Sensitive capture of circulating tumour cells by functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets,"<p>The spread of cancer throughout the body is driven by circulating tumour cells (CTCs). These cells detach from the primary tumour and move from the bloodstream to a new site of subsequent tumour growth. They also carry information about the primary tumour and have the potential to be valuable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and progression, and for the molecular characterization of certain biological properties of the tumour. However, the limited sensitivity and specificity of current methods for measuring and studying these cells in patient blood samples prevents the realization of their full clinical potential. The use of microfluidic devices is a promising method for isolating CTCs. However, the devices are reliant on three-dimensional structures, which limits further characterization and expansion of cells on the chip. Here we demonstrate an effective approach to isolating CTCs from blood samples of pancreatic, breast and lung cancer patients, by using functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets on a patterned gold surface. CTCs were captured with high sensitivity at a low concentration of target cells (73&#160;&#177;&#160;32.4% at 3&#8211;5&#160;cells per ml blood).</p>",[],False,"[""Hyeun Joong Yoon"", ""Tae Hyun Kim"", ""Zhuo Zhang"", ""Ebrahim Azizi"", ""Trinh M.

article,Current-induced skyrmion dynamics in constricted geometries,"<p>Magnetic skyrmions&#8212;vortex-like swirling spin structures with a quantized topological number that are observed in chiral magnets&#8212;are appealing for potential applications in spintronics because it is possible to control their motion with ultralow current density. To realize skyrmion-based spintronic devices, it is essential to understand skyrmion motions in confined geometries. Here we show by micromagnetic simulations that the current-induced motion of skyrmions in the presence of geometrical boundaries is very different from that in an infinite plane. In a channel of finite width, transverse confinement results in steady-state characteristics of the skyrmion velocity as a function of current that are similar to those of domain walls in ferromagnets, whereas the transient behaviour depends on the initial distance of the skyrmion from the boundary. Furthermore, we show that a single skyrmion can be created by an electric current in a simple constricted geometry comprising a plate-shaped specimen of suitable size and geometry. These findings could guide the design of skyrmion-based devices in which skyrmions are used as information carriers.</p>",[],False,"[""Junichi Iwasaki"", ""Masahito Mochizuki"", ""Naoto Nagaosa""]","Iwasaki, J., Mochizuki, M. & Nagaosa, N.

article,Switching of ferroelectric polarization in epitaxial BaTiO3 films on silicon without a conducting bottom electrode,"<p>Epitaxial growth of SrTiO<sub>3</sub> on silicon by molecular beam epitaxy has opened up the route to the integration of functional complex oxides on a silicon platform. Chief among them is ferroelectric functionality using perovskite oxides such as BaTiO<sub>3</sub>. However, it has remained a challenge to achieve ferroelectricity in epitaxial BaTiO<sub>3</sub> films with a polarization pointing perpendicular to the silicon substrate without a conducting bottom electrode. Here, we demonstrate ferroelectricity in such stacks. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of crystalline domains with the long axis of the tetragonal structure oriented perpendicular to the substrate. Using piezoforce microscopy, polar domains can be written and read and are reversibly switched with a phase change of 180&#176;. Open, saturated hysteresis loops are recorded. Thus, ferroelectric switching of 8- to 40-nm-thick BaTiO<sub>3</sub> films in metal&#8211;ferroelectric&#8211;semiconductor structures is realized, and field-effect devices using this epitaxial oxide stack can be envisaged.</p>",[],False,"[""Catherine Dubourdieu"", ""John Bruley"", ""Thomas M.

article,Programmable chemical controllers made from DNA,"<p>Biological organisms use complex molecular networks to navigate their environment and regulate their internal state. The development of synthetic systems with similar capabilities could lead to applications such as smart therapeutics or fabrication methods based on self-organization. To achieve this, molecular control circuits need to be engineered to perform integrated sensing, computation and actuation. Here we report a DNA-based technology for implementing the computational core of such controllers. We use the formalism of chemical reaction networks as a 'programming language' and our DNA architecture can, in principle, implement any behaviour that can be mathematically expressed as such. Unlike logic circuits, our formulation naturally allows complex signal processing of intrinsically analogue biological and chemical inputs. Controller components can be derived from biologically synthesized (plasmid) DNA, which reduces errors associated with chemically synthesized DNA. We implement several building-block reaction types and then combine them into a network that realizes, at the molecular level, an algorithm used in distributed control systems for achieving consensus between multiple agents.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuan-Jyue Chen"", ""Neil Dalchau"", ""Niranjan Srinivas"", ""Andrew Phillips"", ""Luca Cardelli"", ""David Soloveichik"", ""Georg Seelig""]","Chen, YJ., Dalchau, N., Srinivas, N. et al.

article,Self-assembly of carbon nanotubes and antibodies on tumours for targeted amplified delivery,"<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can deliver imaging agents or drugs to tumours and offer significant advantages over approaches based on antibodies or other nanomaterials. In particular, the nanotubes can carry a substantial amount of cargo (100 times more than a monoclonal antibody), but can still be rapidly eliminated from the circulation by renal filtration, like a small molecule, due to their high aspect ratio. Here we show that SWNTs can target tumours in a two-step approach in which nanotubes modified with morpholino oligonucleotide sequences bind to cancer cells that have been pretargeted with antibodies modified with oligonucleotide strands complementary to those on the nanotubes. The nanotubes can carry fluorophores or radioisotopes, and are shown to selectively bind to cancer cells in vitro and in tumour-bearing xenografted mice. The binding process is also found to lead to antigen capping and internalization of the antibody&#8211;nanotube complexes. The nanotube conjugates were labelled with both alpha-particle and gamma-ray emitting isotopes, at high specific activities.

article,Rapid formation of plasma protein corona critically affects nanoparticle pathophysiology,"<p>In biological fluids, proteins bind to the surface of nanoparticles to form a coating known as the protein corona, which can critically affect the interaction of the nanoparticles with living systems. As physiological systems are highly dynamic, it is important to obtain a time-resolved knowledge of protein-corona formation, development and biological relevancy. Here we show that label-free snapshot proteomics can be used to obtain quantitative time-resolved profiles of human plasma coronas formed on silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various size and surface functionalization. Complex time- and nanoparticle-specific coronas, which comprise almost 300 different proteins, were found to form rapidly (&lt;0.5 minutes) and, over time, to change significantly in terms of the amount of bound protein, but not in composition.
