letter,Electronic and plasmonic phenomena at graphene grain boundaries,"<p>Graphene, a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms of great interest in (opto)electronics and plasmonics, can be obtained by means of diverse fabrication techniques, among which chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is one of the most promising for technological applications. The electronic and mechanical properties of CVD-grown graphene depend in large part on the characteristics of the grain boundaries. However, the physical properties of these grain boundaries remain challenging to characterize directly and conveniently. Here we show that it is possible to visualize and investigate the grain boundaries in CVD-grown graphene using an infrared nano-imaging technique. We harness surface plasmons that are reflected and scattered by the graphene grain boundaries, thus causing plasmon interference. By recording and analysing the interference patterns, we can map grain boundaries for a large-area CVD graphene film and probe the electronic properties of individual grain boundaries. Quantitative analysis reveals that grain boundaries form electronic barriers that obstruct both electrical transport and plasmon propagation. The effective width of these barriers (&#8764;10&#8211;20 nm) depends on the electronic screening and is on the order of the Fermi wavelength of graphene. These results uncover a microscopic mechanism that is responsible for the low electron mobility observed in CVD-grown graphene, and suggest the possibility of using electronic barriers to realize tunable plasmon reflectors and phase retarders in future graphene-based plasmonic circuits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, 92093, California, USA', 'authors': ['Z.

letter,Graphene–MoS2 hybrid structures for multifunctional photoresponsive memory devices,"<p>Combining the electronic properties of graphene and molybdenum disulphide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) in hybrid heterostructures offers the possibility to create devices with various functionalities. Electronic logic and memory devices have already been constructed from graphene&#8211;MoS<sub>2</sub> hybrids, but they do not make use of the photosensitivity of MoS<sub>2</sub>, which arises from its optical-range bandgap. Here, we demonstrate that graphene-on-MoS<sub>2</sub> binary heterostructures display remarkable dual optoelectronic functionality, including highly sensitive photodetection and gate-tunable persistent photoconductivity. The responsivity of the hybrids was found to be nearly 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>10</sup> A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 130&#160;K and 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>8</sup>&#160;A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at room temperature, making them the most sensitive graphene-based photodetectors. When subjected to time-dependent photoillumination, the hybrids could also function as a rewritable optoelectronic switch or memory, where the persistent state shows almost no relaxation or decay within experimental timescales, indicating near-perfect charge retention. These effects can be quantitatively explained by gate-tunable charge exchange between the graphene and MoS<sub>2</sub> layers, and may lead to new graphene-based optoelectronic devices that are naturally scalable for large-area applications at room temperature.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India', 'authors': ['Kallol Roy', ',\xa0Medini Padmanabhan', ',\xa0Srijit Goswami', ',\xa0T.

letter,Multivalent ligands control stem cell behaviour in vitro and in vivo,"<p>There is broad interest in designing nanostructured materials that can interact with cells and regulate key downstream functions. In particular, materials with nanoscale features may enable control over multivalent interactions, which involve the simultaneous binding of multiple ligands on one entity to multiple receptors on another and are ubiquitous throughout biology. Cellular signal transduction of growth factor and morphogen cues (which have critical roles in regulating cell function and fate) often begins with such multivalent binding of ligands, either secreted or cell-surface-tethered to target cell receptors, leading to receptor clustering. Cellular mechanisms that orchestrate ligand&#8211;receptor oligomerization are complex, however, so the capacity to control multivalent interactions and thereby modulate key signalling events within living systems is currently very limited. Here, we demonstrate the design of potent multivalent conjugates that can organize stem cell receptors into nanoscale clusters and control stem cell behaviour in vitro and in vivo. The ectodomain of ephrin-B2, normally an integral membrane protein ligand, was conjugated to a soluble biopolymer to yield multivalent nanoscale conjugates that potently induce signalling in neural stem cells and promote their neuronal differentiation both in culture and within the brain. Super-resolution microscopy analysis yielded insights into the organization of the receptor&#8211;ligand clusters at the nanoscale. We also found that synthetic multivalent conjugates of ephrin-B1 strongly enhance human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation into functional dopaminergic neurons. Multivalent bioconjugates are therefore powerful tools and potential nanoscale therapeutics for controlling the behaviour of target stem cells in vitro and in vivo.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, 201 Gilman Hall, University of California, Berkeley, 94720-1462, California, USA', 'authors': ['Anthony Conway', ',\xa0Tandis Vazin', '\xa0&\xa0David V.

article,"Nucleation, stability and current-induced motion of isolated magnetic skyrmions in nanostructures","<p>Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable spin configurations, which usually originate from chiral interactions known as Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. Skyrmion lattices were initially observed in bulk non-centrosymmetric crystals, but have more recently been noted in ultrathin films, where their existence is explained by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions induced by the proximity to an adjacent layer with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Skyrmions are promising candidates as information carriers for future information-processing devices due to their small size (down to a few nanometres) and to the very small current densities needed to displace skyrmion lattices. However, any practical application will probably require the creation, manipulation and detection of isolated skyrmions in magnetic thin-film nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate by numerical investigations that an isolated skyrmion can be a stable configuration in a nanostructure, can be locally nucleated by injection of spin-polarized current, and can be displaced by current-induced spin torques, even in the presence of large defects.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Unité Mixte de Physique CNRS/Thales and Université, Paris Sud, Palaiseau, France', 'authors': ['J.

article,Hot-electron nanoscopy using adiabatic compression of surface plasmons,"<p>Surface plasmon polaritons are a central concept in nanoplasmonics and have been exploited to develop ultrasensitive chemical detection platforms, as well as imaging and spectroscopic techniques at the nanoscale. Surface plasmons can decay to form highly energetic (or hot) electrons in a process that is usually thought to be parasitic for applications, because it limits the lifetime and propagation length of surface plasmons and therefore has an adverse influence on the functionality of nanoplasmonic devices. Recently, however, it has been shown that hot electrons produced by surface plasmon decay can be harnessed to produce useful work in photodetection, catalysis and solar energy conversion. Nevertheless, the surface-plasmon-to-hot-electron conversion efficiency has been below 1% in all cases. Here we show that adiabatic focusing of surface plasmons on a Schottky diode-terminated tapered tip of nanoscale dimensions allows for a plasmon-to-hot-electron conversion efficiency of &#8764;30%. We further demonstrate that, with such high efficiency, hot electrons can be used for a new nanoscopy technique based on an atomic force microscopy set-up. We show that this hot-electron nanoscopy preserves the chemical sensitivity of the scanned surface and has a spatial resolution below 50 nm, with margins for improvement.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nanostructures, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, via Morego 30, Genova, 16163, Italy', 'authors': ['A.

article,Direct probing of the exchange interaction at buried interfaces,"<p>The fundamental interactions between magnetic moments at interfaces have an important impact on the properties of layered magnetic structures. Hence, a direct probing of these interactions is highly desirable for understanding a wide range of phenomena in low-dimensional solids. Here we propose a method for probing the magnetic exchange interaction at buried interfaces using spin-polarized electrons and taking advantage of the collective nature of elementary magnetic excitations (magnons). We demonstrate that, for the case of weak coupling at the interface, the low-energy magnon mode is mainly localized at the interface. Because this mode has the longest lifetime of the modes and has a finite spectral weight across the layers on top, it can be probed by electrons. A comparison of experimental data and first-principles calculations leads to the determination of the interface exchange parameters. This method may help the development of spectroscopy of buried magnetic interfaces.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Max-Planck-Institut für Mikrostrukturphysik, Weinberg 2, Halle, 06120, Germany', 'authors': ['Kh.

article,Formation and electronic properties of InSb nanocrosses,"<p>Signatures of Majorana fermions have recently been reported from measurements on hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor nanowire devices. Majorana fermions are predicted to obey special quantum statistics, known as non-Abelian statistics. To probe this requires an exchange operation, in which two Majorana fermions are moved around one another, which requires at least a simple network of nanowires. Here, we report on the synthesis and electrical characterization of crosses of InSb nanowires. The InSb wires grow horizontally on flexible vertical stems, allowing nearby wires to meet and merge. In this way, near-planar single-crystalline nanocrosses are created, which can be measured by four electrical contacts. Our transport measurements show that the favourable properties of the InSb nanowire devices&#8212;high carrier mobility and the ability to induce superconductivity&#8212;are preserved in the cross devices. Our nanocrosses thus represent a promising system for the exchange of Majorana fermions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, PO Box 513, 5600 MB, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Sébastien R.

article,A general strategy for the DNA-mediated self-assembly of functional nanoparticles into heterogeneous systems,"<p>Nanoparticles coated with DNA molecules can be programmed to self-assemble into three-dimensional superlattices. Such superlattices can be made from nanoparticles with different functionalities and could potentially exploit the synergetic properties of the nanoscale components. However, the approach has so far been used primarily with single-component systems. Here, we report a general strategy for the creation of heterogeneous nanoparticle superlattices using DNA and carboxylic-based conjugation. We show that nanoparticles with all major types of functionality&#8212;plasmonic (gold), magnetic (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), catalytic (palladium) and luminescent (CdSe/Te@ZnS and CdSe@ZnS)&#8212;can be incorporated into binary systems in a rational manner. We also examine the effect of nanoparticle characteristics (including size, shape, number of DNA per particle and DNA flexibility) on the phase behaviour of the heterosystems, and demonstrate that the assembled materials can have novel optical and field-responsive properties.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Functional Nanomaterials, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York, 11973, USA', 'authors': ['Yugang Zhang', ',\xa0Fang Lu', ',\xa0Kevin G.

article,In vivo biosensing via tissue-localizable near-infrared-fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are particularly attractive for biomedical applications, because they exhibit a fluorescent signal in a spectral region where there is minimal interference from biological media. Although single-walled carbon nanotubes have been used as highly sensitive detectors for various compounds, their use as in vivo biomarkers requires the simultaneous optimization of various parameters, including biocompatibility, molecular recognition, high fluorescence quantum efficiency and signal transduction. Here we show that a polyethylene glycol ligated copolymer stabilizes near-infrared-fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes sensors in solution, enabling intravenous injection into mice and the selective detection of local nitric oxide concentration with a detection limit of 1&#160;&#181;M. The half-life for liver retention is 4&#160;h, with sensors clearing the lungs within 2&#160;h after injection, thus avoiding a dominant route of in vivo nanotoxicology. After localization within the liver, it is possible to follow the transient inflammation using nitric oxide as a marker and signalling molecule. To this end, we also report a spatial-spectral imaging algorithm to deconvolute fluorescence intensity and spatial information from measurements. Finally, we demonstrate that alginate-encapsulated single-walled carbon nanotubes can function as implantable inflammation sensors for nitric oxide detection, with no intrinsic immune reactivity or other adverse response for more than 400 days.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Nicole M.
