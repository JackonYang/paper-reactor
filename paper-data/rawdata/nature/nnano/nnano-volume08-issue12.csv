letter,Superlubricity in centimetres-long double-walled carbon nanotubes under ambient conditions,"<p>Friction and wear are two main causes of mechanical energy dissipation and component failure, especially in micro/nanomechanical systems with large surface-to-volume ratios. In the past decade there has been an increasing level of research interest regarding superlubricity, a phenomenon, also called structural superlubricity, in which friction almost vanishes between two incommensurate solid surfaces. However, all experimental structural superlubricity has been obtained on the microscale or nanoscale, and predominantly under high vacuum. Here, we show that superlubricity can be realized in centimetres-long double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) under ambient conditions. Centimetres-long inner shells can be pulled out continuously from such nanotubes, with an intershell friction lower than 1&#160;nN that is independent of nanotube length. The shear strength of the DWCNTs is only several pascals, four orders of magnitude lower than the lowest reported value in CNTs and graphite. The perfect structure of the ultralong DWCNTs used in our experiments is essential for macroscale superlubricity.</p>",[],False,"[""Rufan Zhang"", ""Zhiyuan Ning"", ""Yingying Zhang"", ""Quanshui Zheng"", ""Qing Chen"", ""Huanhuan Xie"", ""Qiang Zhang"", ""Weizhong Qian"", ""Fei Wei""]","Zhang, R., Ning, Z., Zhang, Y. et al.

letter,High-throughput optical imaging and spectroscopy of individual carbon nanotubes in devices,"<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are uniquely identified by a pair of chirality indices (n,m), which dictate the physical structures and electronic properties of each species. Carbon nanotube research is currently facing two outstanding challenges: achieving chirality-controlled growth and understanding chirality-dependent device physics. Addressing these challenges requires, respectively, high-throughput determination of the nanotube chirality distribution on growth substrates and in situ characterization of the nanotube electronic structure in operating devices. Direct optical imaging and spectroscopy techniques are well suited for both goals, but their implementation at the single nanotube level has remained a challenge due to the small nanotube signal and unavoidable environment background. Here, we report high-throughput real-time optical imaging and broadband in situ spectroscopy of individual carbon nanotubes on various substrates and in field-effect transistor devices using polarization-based microscopy combined with supercontinuum laser illumination. Our technique enables the complete chirality profiling of hundreds of individual carbon nanotubes, both semiconducting and metallic, on a growth substrate. In devices, we observe that high-order nanotube optical resonances are dramatically broadened by electrostatic doping, an unexpected behaviour that points to strong interband electron&#8211;electron scattering processes that could dominate ultrafast dynamics of excited states in carbon nanotubes.</p>",[],False,"[""Kaihui Liu"", ""Xiaoping Hong"", ""Qin Zhou"", ""Chenhao Jin"", ""Jinghua Li"", ""Weiwei Zhou"", ""Jie Liu"", ""Enge Wang"", ""Alex Zettl"", ""Feng Wang""]","Liu, K., Hong, X., Zhou, Q. et al.

letter,Graphene mechanical oscillators with tunable frequency,"<p>Oscillators, which produce continuous periodic signals from direct current power, are central to modern communications systems, with versatile applications including timing references and frequency modulators. However, conventional oscillators typically consist of macroscopic mechanical resonators such as quartz crystals, which require excessive off-chip space. Here, we report oscillators built on micrometre-size, atomically thin graphene nanomechanical resonators, whose frequencies can be electrostatically tuned by as much as 14%. Self-sustaining mechanical motion is generated and transduced at room temperature in these oscillators using simple electrical circuitry. The prototype graphene voltage-controlled oscillators exhibit frequency stability and a modulation bandwidth sufficient for the modulation of radiofrequency carrier signals. As a demonstration, we use a graphene oscillator as the active element for frequency-modulated signal generation and achieve efficient audio signal transmission.</p>",[],False,"[""Changyao Chen"", ""Sunwoo Lee"", ""Vikram V.

letter,Reprogramming an ATP-driven protein machine into a light-gated nanocage,"<p>Natural protein assemblies have many sophisticated architectures and functions, creating nanoscale storage containers, motors and pumps. Inspired by these systems, protein monomers have been engineered to self-assemble into supramolecular architectures including symmetrical, metal-templated and cage-like structures. The complexity of protein machines, however, has made it difficult to create assemblies with both defined structures and controllable functions. Here we report protein assemblies that have been engineered to function as light-controlled nanocontainers. We show that an adenosine-5&#8242;-triphosphate-driven group II chaperonin, which resembles a barrel with a built-in lid, can be reprogrammed to open and close on illumination with different wavelengths of light. By engineering photoswitchable azobenzene-based molecules into the structure, light-triggered changes in interatomic distances in the azobenzene moiety are able to drive large-scale conformational changes of the protein assembly. The different states of the assembly can be visualized with single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, and the nanocages can be used to capture and release non-native cargos. Similar strategies that switch atomic distances with light could be used to build other controllable nanoscale machines.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel Hoersch"", ""Soung-Hun Roh"", ""Wah Chiu"", ""Tanja Kortemme""]","Hoersch, D., Roh, SH., Chiu, W. et al.

letter,Nanoparticle-detained toxins for safe and effective vaccination,"<p>Toxoid vaccines&#8212;vaccines based on inactivated bacterial toxins&#8212;are routinely used to promote antitoxin immunity for the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. Following chemical or heat denaturation, inactivated toxins can be administered to mount toxin-specific immune responses. However, retaining faithful antigenic presentation while removing toxin virulence remains a major challenge and presents a trade-off between efficacy and safety in toxoid development. Here, we show a nanoparticle-based toxin-detainment strategy that safely delivers non-disrupted pore-forming toxins for immune processing. Using erythrocyte membrane-coated nanoparticles and staphylococcal &#945;-haemolysin, we demonstrate effective virulence neutralization via spontaneous particle entrapment. Compared with vaccination with heat-denatured toxin, mice vaccinated with the nanoparticle-detained toxin showed superior protective immunity against toxin-mediated adverse effects. We find that the non-disruptive detoxification approach benefited the immunogenicity and efficacy of toxoid vaccines.

article,Detecting the translocation of DNA through a nanopore using graphene nanoribbons,"<p>Solid-state nanopores can act as single-molecule sensors and could potentially be used to rapidly sequence DNA molecules. However, nanopores are typically fabricated in insulating membranes that are as thick as 15 bases, which makes it difficult for the devices to read individual bases. Graphene is only 0.335&#160;nm thick (equivalent to the spacing between two bases in a DNA chain) and could therefore provide a suitable membrane for sequencing applications. Here, we show that a solid-state nanopore can be integrated with a graphene nanoribbon transistor to create a sensor for DNA translocation. As DNA molecules move through the pore, the device can simultaneously measure drops in ionic current and changes in local voltage in the transistor, which can both be used to detect the molecules. We examine the correlation between these two signals and use the ionic current measurements as a real-time control of the graphene-based sensing device.</p>",[],False,"[""F. Traversi"", ""C.

article,Optoelectronic control of surface charge and translocation dynamics in solid-state nanopores,"<p>Nanopores can be used to detect and analyse biomolecules. However, controlling the translocation speed of molecules through a pore is difficult, which limits the wider application of these sensors. Here, we show that low-power visible light can be used to control surface charge in solid-state nanopores and can influence the translocation dynamics of DNA and proteins. We find that laser light precisely focused at a nanopore can induce reversible negative surface charge densities as high as 1&#160;C&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, and that the effect is tunable on submillisecond timescales by adjusting the photon density. By modulating the surface charge, we can control the amount of electroosmotic flow through the nanopore, which affects the speed of translocating biomolecules. In particular, a few milliwatts of green light can reduce the translocation speed of double-stranded DNA by more than an order of magnitude and the translocation speed of small globular proteins such as ubiquitin by more than two orders of magnitude. The laser light can also be used to unclog blocked pores. Finally, we discuss a mechanism to account for the observed optoelectronic phenomenon.</p>",[],False,"[""Nicolas Di Fiori"", ""Allison Squires"", ""Daniel Bar"", ""Tal Gilboa"", ""Theodore D.

Vertical integration of layered materials can enable the design of novel electronic and photonic devices.

The weak electrostatic screening effect of graphene allows the integration of single or dual gates under and/or above the vertical heterostructure to tune the band slope and photocurrent generation. We demonstrate that the amplitude and polarity of the photocurrent in the gated vertical heterostructures can be readily modulated by the electric field of an external gate to achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 55% and internal quantum efficiency up to 85%.

article,Molecular recognition using corona phase complexes made of synthetic polymers adsorbed on carbon nanotubes,"<p>Understanding molecular recognition is of fundamental importance in applications such as therapeutics, chemical catalysis and sensor design. The most common recognition motifs involve biological macromolecules such as antibodies and aptamers. The key to biorecognition consists of a unique three-dimensional structure formed by a folded and constrained bioheteropolymer that creates a binding pocket, or an interface, able to recognize a specific molecule. Here, we show that synthetic heteropolymers, once constrained onto a single-walled carbon nanotube by chemical adsorption, also form a new corona phase that exhibits highly selective recognition for specific molecules. To prove the generality of this phenomenon, we report three examples of heteropolymer&#8211;nanotube recognition complexes for riboflavin, L-thyroxine and oestradiol. In each case, the recognition was predicted using a two-dimensional thermodynamic model of surface interactions in which the dissociation constants can be tuned by perturbing the chemical structure of the heteropolymer. Moreover, these complexes can be used as new types of spatiotemporal sensors based on modulation of the carbon nanotube photoemission in the near-infrared, as we show by tracking riboflavin diffusion in murine macrophages.</p>",[],False,"[""Jingqing Zhang"", ""Markita P.
