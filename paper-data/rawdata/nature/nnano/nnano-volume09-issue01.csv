letter,Engineering myosins for long-range transport on actin filaments,"<p>Cytoskeletal motors act as cargo transporters in cells and may be harnessed for directed transport applications in molecular detection and diagnostic devices. High processivity, the ability to take many steps along a track before dissociating, is often a desirable characteristic because it allows nanoscale motors to transport cargoes over distances on the scale of micrometres, in vivo and in vitro. Natural processive myosins are dimeric and use internal tension to coordinate the detachment cycles of the two heads. Here, we show that processivity can be enhanced in engineered myosins using two non-natural strategies designed to optimize the effectiveness of random, uncoordinated stepping: (1) the formation of three-headed and four-headed myosins and (2) the introduction of flexible elements between heads. We quantify improvements using systematic single-molecule characterization of a panel of engineered motors. To test the modularity of our approach, we design a controllably bidirectional myosin that is robustly processive in both forward and backward directions, and also produce the fastest processive cytoskeletal motor measured so far, reaching a speed of 10&#160;&#181;m&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p>",[],False,"[""Tony D.

letter,A synthetic DNA motor that transports nanoparticles along carbon nanotubes,"<p>Intracellular protein motors have evolved to perform specific tasks critical to the function of cells such as intracellular trafficking and cell division. Kinesin and dynein motors, for example, transport cargoes in living cells by walking along microtubules powered by adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. These motors can make discrete 8&#160;nm centre-of-mass steps and can travel over 1&#160;&#181;m by changing their conformations during the course of adenosine triphosphate binding, hydrolysis and product release. Inspired by such biological machines, synthetic analogues have been developed including self-assembled DNA walkers that can make stepwise movements on RNA/DNA substrates or can function as programmable assembly lines. Here, we show that motors based on RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes can transport nanoparticle cargoes&#8212;CdS nanocrystals in this case&#8212;along single-walled carbon nanotubes. Our motors extract chemical energy from RNA molecules decorated on the nanotubes and use that energy to fuel autonomous, processive walking through a series of conformational changes along the one-dimensional track. The walking is controllable and adapts to changes in the local environment, which allows us to remotely direct &#8216;go&#8217; and &#8216;stop&#8217; actions. The translocation of individual motors can be visualized in real time using the visible fluorescence of the cargo nanoparticle and the near-infared emission of the carbon-nanotube track. We observed unidirectional movements of the molecular motors over 3&#160;&#181;m with a translocation velocity on the order of 1&#160;nm&#160;min<sup>&#8722;1</sup> under our experimental conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Tae-Gon Cha"", ""Jing Pan"", ""Haorong Chen"", ""Janette Salgado"", ""Xiang Li"", ""Chengde Mao"", ""Jong Hyun Choi""]","Cha, TG., Pan, J., Chen, H. et al.A synthetic DNA motor that transports nanoparticles along carbon nanotubes.

letter,Transport and self-organization across different length scales powered by motor proteins and programmed by DNA,"<p>In eukaryotic cells, cargo is transported on self-organized networks of microtubule trackways by kinesin and dynein motor proteins. Synthetic microtubule networks have previously been assembled in vitro, and microtubules have been used as shuttles to carry cargoes on lithographically defined tracks consisting of surface-bound kinesin motors. Here, we show that molecular signals can be used to program both the architecture and the operation of a self-organized transport system that is based on kinesin and microtubules and spans three orders of magnitude in length scale. A single motor protein, dimeric kinesin-1, is conjugated to various DNA nanostructures to accomplish different tasks. Instructions encoded into the DNA sequences are used to direct the assembly of a polar array of microtubules and can be used to control the loading, active concentration and unloading of cargo on this track network, or to trigger the disassembly of the network.</p>",[],False,"[""Adam J.

letter,Enhancing spontaneous emission rates of molecules using nanopatterned multilayer hyperbolic metamaterials,"<p>Plasmonic nanostructures have been extensively used to manipulate the spontaneous light emission rate of molecules and their radiative efficiency. Because molecules near a metallic surface experience a different environment than in free space, their spontaneous radiative emission rate is generally enhanced. Such enhancement, measured by means of the Purcell factor, arises as a consequence of the overlap between the surface plasmon mode frequency and the emission spectrum of the molecule. However, such overlap is available only for a few narrow bands of frequency due to the limited plasmonic materials existing in nature. Although this limitation can be overcome by using hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs)&#8212;a type of nanoscale artificial material with hyperbolic dispersion relations&#8212;the Purcell factor and the radiative power have remained relatively low. Here, we show that by nanopatterning a hyperbolic metamaterial made of Ag and Si multilayers, the spontaneous emission rate of rhodamine dye molecules is enhanced 76-fold at tunable frequencies and the emission intensity of the dye increases by &#8764;80-fold compared with the same hyperbolic metamaterial without nanostructuring. We explain these results using a dynamic Lorentzian model in the time domain.</p>",[],False,"[""Dylan Lu"", ""Jimmy J. Kan"", ""Eric E.

letter,Molecular-sized fluorescent nanodiamonds,"<p>Doping of carbon nanoparticles with impurity atoms is central to their application.

Here, we show that isolated diamond nanoparticles as small as 1.6 nm, comprising only &#8764;400 carbon atoms, are capable of housing stable photoluminescent colour centres, namely the silicon vacancy (SiV). Surprisingly, fluorescence from SiVs is stable over time, and few or only single colour centres are found per nanocrystal. We also observe size-dependent SiV emission supported by quantum-chemical simulation of SiV energy levels in small nanodiamonds.

letter,Spin Hall effect clocking of nanomagnetic logic without a magnetic field,"<p>Spin-based computing schemes could enable new functionalities beyond those of charge-based approaches. Examples include nanomagnetic logic, where information can be processed using dipole coupled nanomagnets, as demonstrated by multi-bit computing gates. One fundamental benefit of using magnets is the possibility of a significant reduction in the energy per bit compared with conventional transistors. However, so far, practical implementations of nanomagnetic logic have been limited by the necessity to apply a magnetic field for clocking. Although the energy associated with magnetic switching itself could be very small, the energy necessary to generate the magnetic field renders the overall logic scheme uncompetitive when compared with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) counterparts. Here, we demonstrate a nanomagnetic logic scheme at room temperature where the necessity for using a magnetic field clock can be completely removed by using spin&#8211;orbit torques. We construct a chain of three perpendicularly polarized CoFeB nanomagnets on top of a tantalum wire and show that an unpolarized current flowing through the wire can &#8216;clock&#8217; the perpendicular magnetization to a metastable state. An input magnet can then drive the nanomagnetic chain deterministically to one of two dipole-coupled states, &#8216;2 up 1 down&#8217; or &#8216;2 down 1 up&#8217;, depending on its own polarization. Thus, information can flow along the chain, dictated by the input magnet and clocked solely by a charge current in tantalum, without any magnetic field. A three to four order of magnitude reduction in energy dissipation is expected for our scheme when compared with state-of-the-art nanomagnetic logic.</p>",[],False,"[""Debanjan Bhowmik"", ""Long You"", ""Sayeef Salahuddin""]","Bhowmik, D., You, L. & Salahuddin, S.

letter,Control of single-spin magnetic anisotropy by exchange coupling,"<p>The properties of quantum systems interacting with their environment, commonly called open quantum systems, can be affected strongly by this interaction. Although this can lead to unwanted consequences, such as causing decoherence in qubits used for quantum computation, it can also be exploited as a probe of the environment. For example, magnetic resonance imaging is based on the dependence of the spin relaxation times of protons in water molecules in a host's tissue. Here we show that the excitation energy of a single spin, which is determined by magnetocrystalline anisotropy and controls its stability and suitability for use in magnetic data-storage devices, can be modified by varying the exchange coupling of the spin to a nearby conductive electrode. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we observe variations up to a factor of two of the spin excitation energies of individual atoms as the strength of the spin's coupling to the surrounding electronic bath changes. These observations, combined with calculations, show that exchange coupling can strongly modify the magnetic anisotropy. This system is thus one of the few open quantum systems in which the energy levels, and not just the excited-state lifetimes, can be renormalized controllably. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, a property normally determined by the local structure around a spin, can be tuned electronically. These effects may play a significant role in the development of spintronic devices in which an individual magnetic atom or molecule is coupled to conducting leads.</p>",[],False,"[""Jenny C.

letter,Efficient solar water-splitting using a nanocrystalline CoO photocatalyst,"<p>The generation of hydrogen from water using sunlight could potentially form the basis of a clean and renewable source of energy. Various water-splitting methods have been investigated previously, but the use of photocatalysts to split water into stoichiometric amounts of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> (overall water splitting) without the use of external bias or sacrificial reagents is of particular interest because of its simplicity and potential low cost of operation. However, despite progress in the past decade, semiconductor water-splitting photocatalysts (such as (Ga<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>Zn<sub>x</sub>)(N<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>O<sub>x</sub>)) do not exhibit good activity beyond 440&#160;nm (refs) and water-splitting devices that can harvest visible light typically have a low solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of around 0.1%. Here we show that cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) nanoparticles can carry out overall water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of around 5%. The photocatalysts were synthesized from non-active CoO micropowders using two distinct methods (femtosecond laser ablation and mechanical ball milling), and the CoO nanoparticles that result can decompose pure water under visible-light irradiation without any co-catalysts or sacrificial reagents. Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we show that the high photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles arises from a significant shift in the position of the band edge of the material.</p>",[],False,"[""Longb Liao"", ""Qiuhui Zhang"", ""Zhihua Su"", ""Zhongzheng Zhao"", ""Yanan Wang"", ""Yang Li"", ""Xiaoxiang Lu"", ""Dongguang Wei"", ""Guoying Feng"", ""Qingkai Yu"", ""Xiaojun Cai"", ""Jimin Zhao"", ""Zhifeng Ren"", ""Hui Fang"", ""Francisco Robles-Hernandez"", ""Steven Baldelli"", ""Jiming Bao""]","Liao, L., Zhang, Q., Su, Z. et al.

Short molecular linkers have previously been used to create assemblies of nanoparticles, but the approach is limited to small interparticle distances, typically less than 10&#160;nm. Alternatively, DNA origami can precisely organize nanoscale objects over much larger length scales.

The nanoclusters have a tunable stoichiometry, defined distances of 5&#8211;200&#160;nm between components, and controllable overall sizes of up to 500&#160;nm. We also show that the nanoscale components can be positioned along the radial DNA spacers of the nanostructures, which allows short- and long-range interactions between nanoparticles and dyes to be studied in solution.

article,Spin-resolved Andreev levels and parity crossings in hybrid superconductor–semiconductor nanostructures,"<p>The physics and operating principles of hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor devices rest ultimately on the magnetic properties of their elementary subgap excitations, usually called Andreev levels. Here we report a direct measurement of the Zeeman effect on the Andreev levels of a semiconductor quantum dot with large electron g-factor, strongly coupled to a conventional superconductor with a large critical magnetic field. This material combination allows spin degeneracy to be lifted without destroying superconductivity. We show that a spin-split Andreev level crossing the Fermi energy results in a quantum phase transition to a spin-polarized state, which implies a change in the fermionic parity of the system. This crossing manifests itself as a zero-bias conductance anomaly at finite magnetic field with properties that resemble those expected for Majorana modes in a topological superconductor. Although this resemblance is understood without evoking topological superconductivity, the observed parity transitions could be regarded as precursors of Majorana modes in the long-wire limit.</p>",[],False,"[""Eduardo J.
