letter,Formation of a protected sub-band for conduction in quantum point contacts under extreme biasing,"<p>Managing energy dissipation is critical to the scaling of current microelectronics and to the development of novel devices that use quantum coherence to achieve enhanced functionality. To this end, strategies are needed to tailor the electron&#8211;phonon interaction, which is the dominant mechanism for cooling non-equilibrium (&#8216;hot&#8217;) carriers. In experiments aimed at controlling the quantum state, this interaction causes decoherence that fundamentally disrupts device operation. Here, we show a contrasting behaviour, in which strong electron&#8211;phonon scattering can instead be used to generate a robust mode for electrical conduction in GaAs quantum point contacts, driven into extreme non-equilibrium by nanosecond voltage pulses. When the amplitude of these pulses is much larger than all other relevant energy scales, strong electron&#8211;phonon scattering induces an attraction between electrons in the quantum-point-contact channel, which leads to the spontaneous formation of a narrow current filament and to a renormalization of the electronic states responsible for transport. The lowest of these states coalesce to form a sub-band separated from all others by an energy gap larger than the source voltage. Evidence for this renormalization is provided by a suppression of heating-related signatures in the transient conductance, which becomes pinned near 2e<sup>2</sup>/h (e, electron charge; h, Planck constant) for a broad range of source and gate voltages. This collective non-equilibrium mode is observed over a wide range of temperature (4.2&#8211;300&#160;K) and may provide an effective means to manage electron&#8211;phonon scattering in nanoscale devices.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

letter,Strain-mediated coupling in a quantum dot–mechanical oscillator hybrid system,"<p>Recent progress in nanotechnology has allowed the fabrication of new hybrid systems in which a single two-level system is coupled to a mechanical nanoresonator. In such systems the quantum nature of a macroscopic degree of freedom can be revealed and manipulated. This opens up appealing perspectives for quantum information technologies, and for the exploration of the quantum&#8211;classical boundary. Here we present the experimental realization of a monolithic solid-state hybrid system governed by material strain: a quantum dot is embedded within a nanowire that features discrete mechanical resonances corresponding to flexural vibration modes. Mechanical vibrations result in a time-varying strain field that modulates the quantum dot transition energy. This approach simultaneously offers a large light-extraction efficiency and a large exciton&#8211;phonon coupling strength g<sub>0</sub>. By means of optical and mechanical spectroscopy, we find that g<sub>0</sub>/2&#960; is nearly as large as the mechanical frequency, a criterion that defines the ultrastrong coupling regime.</p>",[],False,"[""I.

letter,Direct observation of the transition from indirect to direct bandgap in atomically thin epitaxial MoSe2,"<p>Quantum systems in confined geometries are host to novel physical phenomena. Examples include quantum Hall systems in semiconductors and Dirac electrons in graphene. Interest in such systems has also been intensified by the recent discovery of a large enhancement in photoluminescence quantum efficiency and a potential route to valleytronics in atomically thin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides, MX<sub>2</sub> (M&#160;=&#160;Mo, W; X&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te), which are closely related to the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition in monolayers. Here, we report the first direct observation of the transition from indirect to direct bandgap in monolayer samples by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on high-quality thin films of MoSe<sub>2</sub> with variable thickness, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The band structure measured experimentally indicates a stronger tendency of monolayer MoSe<sub>2</sub> towards a direct bandgap, as well as a larger gap size, than theoretically predicted. Moreover, our finding of a significant spin-splitting of &#8764;180 meV at the valence band maximum of a monolayer MoSe<sub>2</sub> film could expand its possible application to spintronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Yi Zhang"", ""Tay-Rong Chang"", ""Bo Zhou"", ""Yong-Tao Cui"", ""Hao Yan"", ""Zhongkai Liu"", ""Felix Schmitt"", ""James Lee"", ""Rob Moore"", ""Yulin Chen"", ""Hsin Lin"", ""Horng-Tay Jeng"", ""Sung-Kwan Mo"", ""Zahid Hussain"", ""Arun Bansil"", ""Zhi-Xun Shen""]","Zhang, Y., Chang, TR., Zhou, B. et al.

letter,Radial modulation doping in core–shell nanowires,"<p>Semiconductor nanowires are potential candidates for applications in quantum information processing, Josephson junctions and field-effect transistors and provide a unique test bed for low-dimensional physical phenomena. The ability to fabricate nanowire heterostructures with atomically flat, defect-free interfaces enables energy band engineering in both axial and radial directions. The design of radial, or core&#8211;shell, nanowire heterostructures relies on energy band offsets that confine charge carriers into the core region, potentially reducing scattering from charged impurities on the nanowire surface. Key to the design of such nanoscale heterostructures is a fundamental understanding of the heterointerface properties, particularly energy band offsets and strain. The charge-transfer and confinement mechanism can be used to achieve modulation doping in core&#8211;shell structures. By selectively doping the shell, which has a larger bandgap, charge carriers are donated and confined in the core, generating a quasi-one-dimensional electron system with higher mobility. Here, we demonstrate radial modulation doping in coherently strained Ge&#8211;Si<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>1&#8722;</sub><sub>x</sub> core&#8211;shell nanowires and a technique to directly measure their valence band offset. Radial modulation doping is achieved by incorporating a B-doped layer during epitaxial shell growth. In contrast to previous work showing site-selective doping in Ge&#8211;Si core&#8211;shell nanowires, we find both an enhancement in peak hole mobility compared with undoped nanowires and observe a decoupling of electron transport in the core and shell regions. This decoupling stems from the higher carrier mobility in the core than in the shell and allows a direct measurement of the valence band offset for nanowires of various shell compositions.</p>",[],False,"[""David C.

letter,Propagation of magnetic vortices using nanocontacts as tunable attractors,"<p>Magnetic vortices in thin films are in-plane spiral spin configurations with a core in which the magnetization twists out of the film plane. Vortices result from the competition between atomic-scale exchange forces and long-range dipolar interactions. They are often the ground state of magnetic dots, and have applications in medicine, microwave generation and information storage. The compact nature of the vortex core, which is 10&#8211;20&#160;nm wide, makes it a suitable probe of magnetism at the nanoscale. However, thus far the positioning of a vortex has been possible only in confined structures, which prevents its transport over large distances. Here we show that vortices can be propagated in an unconstrained system that comprises electrical nanocontacts (NCs). The NCs are used as tunable vortex attractors in a manner that resembles the propelling of space craft with gravitational slingshots. By passing current from the NCs to a ferromagnetic film, circulating magnetic fields are generated, which nucleate the vortex and create a potential well for it. The current becomes spin polarized in the film, and thereby drives the vortex into gyration through spin-transfer torques. The vortex can be guided from one NC to another by tuning attractive strengths of the NCs. We anticipate that NC networks may be used as multiterminal sources of vortices and spin waves (as well as heat, spin and charge flows) to sense the fundamental interactions between physical objects and fluxes of the next-generation spintronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

letter,A nanophotonic solar thermophotovoltaic device,"<p>The most common approaches to generating power from sunlight are either photovoltaic, in which sunlight directly excites electron&#8211;hole pairs in a semiconductor, or solar&#8211;thermal, in which sunlight drives a mechanical heat engine. Photovoltaic power generation is intermittent and typically only exploits a portion of the solar spectrum efficiently, whereas the intrinsic irreversibilities of small heat engines make the solar&#8211;thermal approach best suited for utility-scale power plants. There is, therefore, an increasing need for hybrid technologies for solar power generation. By converting sunlight into thermal emission tuned to energies directly above the photovoltaic bandgap using a hot absorber&#8211;emitter, solar thermophotovoltaics promise to leverage the benefits of both approaches: high efficiency, by harnessing the entire solar spectrum; scalability and compactness, because of their solid-state nature; and dispatchablility, owing to the ability to store energy using thermal or chemical means. However, efficient collection of sunlight in the absorber and spectral control in the emitter are particularly challenging at high operating temperatures. This drawback has limited previous experimental demonstrations of this approach to conversion efficiencies around or below 1% (refs&#160;). Here, we report on a full solar thermophotovoltaic device, which, thanks to the nanophotonic properties of the absorber&#8211;emitter surface, reaches experimental efficiencies of 3.2%. The device integrates a multiwalled carbon nanotube absorber and a one-dimensional Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> photonic-crystal emitter on the same substrate, with the absorber&#8211;emitter areas optimized to tune the energy balance of the device. Our device is planar and compact and could become a viable option for high-performance solar thermophotovoltaic energy conversion.</p>",[],False,"[""Andrej Lenert"", ""David M.

letter,A surface-bound molecule that undergoes optically biased Brownian rotation,"<p>Developing molecular systems with functions analogous to those of macroscopic machine components, such as rotors, gyroscopes and valves, is a long-standing goal of nanotechnology. However, macroscopic analogies go only so far in predicting function in nanoscale environments, where friction dominates over inertia. In some instances, ratchet mechanisms have been used to bias the ever-present random, thermally driven (Brownian) motion and drive molecular diffusion in desired directions. Here, we visualize the motions of surface-bound molecular rotors using defocused fluorescence imaging, and observe the transition from hindered to free Brownian rotation by tuning medium viscosity. We show that the otherwise random rotations can be biased by the polarization of the excitation light field, even though the associated optical torque is insufficient to overcome thermal fluctuations. The biased rotation is attributed instead to a fluctuating-friction mechanism in which photoexcitation of the rotor strongly inhibits its diffusion rate.</p>",[],False,"[""James A.

Inspired by biological systems, stimuli-responsive materials have been created that can oscillate, transport fluid, provide homeostasis and undergo complex changes in shape. However, the effectiveness of synthetic stimuli-responsive materials in generating work is limited when compared with mechanical actuators. Here, we show that the mechanical response of Bacillus spores to water gradients exhibits an energy density of more than 10&#160;MJ&#160;m<sup>&#8722;3</sup>, which is two orders of magnitude higher than synthetic water-responsive materials. We also identified mutations that can approximately double the energy density of the spores and found that they can self-assemble into dense, submicrometre-thick monolayers on substrates such as silicon microcantilevers and elastomer sheets, creating bio-hybrid hygromorph actuators. To illustrate the potential applications of the spores, we used them to build an energy-harvesting device that can remotely generate electrical power from an evaporating body of water.</p>",[],False,"[""Xi Chen"", ""L.

letter,Free-standing kinked nanowire transistor probes for targeted intracellular recording in three dimensions,"<p>Recording intracellular (IC) bioelectrical signals is central to understanding the fundamental behaviour of cells and cell networks in, for example, neural and cardiac systems. The standard tool for IC recording, the patch-clamp micropipette is applied widely, yet remains limited in terms of reducing the tip size, the ability to reuse the pipette and ion exchange with the cytoplasm. Recent efforts have been directed towards developing new chip-based tools, including micro-to-nanoscale metal pillars, transistor-based kinked nanowires and nanotube devices. These nanoscale tools are interesting with respect to chip-based multiplexing, but, so far, preclude targeted recording from specific cell regions and/or subcellular structures. Here we overcome this limitation in a general manner by fabricating free-standing probes in which a kinked silicon nanowire with an encoded field-effect transistor detector serves as the tip end. These probes can be manipulated in three dimensions within a standard microscope to target specific cells or cell regions, and record stable full-amplitude IC action potentials from different targeted cells without the need to clean or change the tip. Simultaneous measurements from the same cell made with free-standing nanowire and patch-clamp probes show that the same action potential amplitude and temporal properties are recorded without corrections to the raw nanowire signal. In addition, we demonstrate real-time monitoring of changes in the action potential as different ion-channel blockers are applied to cells, and multiplexed recording from cells by independent manipulation of two free-standing nanowire probes.</p>",[],False,"[""Quan Qing"", ""Zhe Jiang"", ""Lin Xu"", ""Ruixuan Gao"", ""Liqiang Mai"", ""Charles M.

Here, we describe the use of DNA to control the biological delivery and elimination of inorganic nanoparticles by organizing them into colloidal superstructures. The individual nanoparticles serve as building blocks, whose size, surface chemistry and assembly architecture dictate the overall superstructure design. These superstructures interact with cells and tissues as a function of their design, but subsequently degrade into building blocks that can escape biological sequestration. We demonstrate that this strategy reduces nanoparticle retention by macrophages and improves their in vivo tumour accumulation and whole-body elimination. Superstructures can be further functionalized to carry and protect imaging or therapeutic agents against enzymatic degradation. These results suggest a different strategy to engineer nanostructure interactions with biological systems and highlight new directions in the design of biodegradable and multifunctional nanomedicine.</p>",[],False,"[""Leo Y.
