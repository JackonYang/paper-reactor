letter,Universal control and error correction in multi-qubit spin registers in diamond,"<p>Quantum registers of nuclear spins coupled to electron spins of individual solid-state defects are a promising platform for quantum information processing. Pioneering experiments selected defects with favourably located nuclear spins with particularly strong hyperfine couplings. To progress towards large-scale applications, larger and deterministically available nuclear registers are highly desirable. Here, we realize universal control over multi-qubit spin registers by harnessing abundant weakly coupled nuclear spins. We use the electron spin of a nitrogen&#8211;vacancy centre in diamond to selectively initialize, control and read out carbon-13 spins in the surrounding spin bath and construct high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. We exploit these new capabilities to implement a three-qubit quantum-error-correction protocol and demonstrate the robustness of the encoded state against applied errors. These results transform weakly coupled nuclear spins from a source of decoherence into a reliable resource, paving the way towards extended quantum networks and surface-code quantum computing based on multi-qubit nodes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, PO Box 5046, 2600 GA Delft, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['T.

letter,Fractionalized wave packets from an artificial Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid,"<p>The model of interacting fermion systems in one dimension known as a Tomonaga&#8211;Luttinger liquid (TLL) provides a simple and exactly solvable theoretical framework that predicts various intriguing physical properties. Evidence of a TLL has been observed as power-law behaviour in electronic transport on various types of one-dimensional conductor. However, these measurements, which rely on d.c. transport involving electron tunneling processes, cannot identify the long-awaited hallmark of charge fractionalization, in which an injection of elementary charge e from a non-interacting lead is divided into the non-trivial effective charge e* and the remainder, e&#8722;e* (refs&#160;). Here, we report time-resolved transport measurements on an artificial TLL composed of coupled integer quantum Hall edge channels, in which we successfully identify single charge fractionalization processes. A wave packet of charge q incident from a non-interacting region breaks up into several fractionalized charge wave packets at the edges of the artificial TLL, from which transport eigenmodes can be evaluated directly. These results are informative for elucidating the nature of TLLs and low-energy excitations in the edge channels.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro, Tokyo, 152-8551, Japan', 'authors': ['H.

letter,Impact of local compressive stress on the optical transitions of single organic dye molecules,"<p>The ability to mechanically control the optical properties of individual molecules is a grand challenge in nanoscience and could enable the manipulation of chemical reactivity at the single-molecule level. In the past, light has been used to alter the emission wavelength of individual molecules or modulate the energy transfer quantum yield between them. Furthermore, tensile stress has been applied to study the force dependence of protein folding/unfolding and of the chemistry and photochemistry of single molecules, although in these mechanical experiments the strength of the weakest bond limits the amount of applicable force. Here, we show that compressive stress modifies the photophysical properties of individual dye molecules. We use an atomic force microscope tip to prod individual molecules adsorbed on a surface and follow the effect of the applied force on the electronic states of the molecule by fluorescence spectroscopy. Applying a localized compressive force on an isolated molecule induces a stress that is redistributed throughout the structure. Accordingly, we observe reversible spectral shifts and even shifts that persist after retracting the microscope tip, which we attribute to transitions to metastable states. Using quantum-mechanical calculations, we show that these photophysical changes can be associated with transitions among the different possible conformers of the adsorbed molecule.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut für Physikalische Chemie, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, Duesbergweg 10-14, Mainz, 55128, Germany', 'authors': ['Sven Stöttinger', ',\xa0Gerald Hinze', ',\xa0Gregor Diezemann', '\xa0&\xa0Thomas Basché']}, {'address': 'Max-Planck-Institut für Polymerforschung, Ackermannweg 10, Mainz, 55128, Germany', 'authors': ['Ingo Oesterling', '\xa0&\xa0Klaus Müllen']}]",False,"['Sven Stöttinger', 'Gerald Hinze', 'Gregor Diezemann', 'Ingo Oesterling', 'Klaus Müllen', 'Thomas Basché']","Stöttinger, S., Hinze, G., Diezemann, G. et al.

letter,A pomegranate-inspired nanoscale design for large-volume-change lithium battery anodes,"<p>Silicon is an attractive material for anodes in energy storage devices, because it has ten times the theoretical capacity of its state-of-the-art carbonaceous counterpart. Silicon anodes can be used both in traditional lithium-ion batteries and in more recent Li&#8211;O<sub>2</sub> and Li&#8211;S batteries as a replacement for the dendrite-forming lithium metal anodes. The main challenges associated with silicon anodes are structural degradation and instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase caused by the large volume change (&#8764;300%) during cycling, the occurrence of side reactions with the electrolyte, and the low volumetric capacity when the material size is reduced to a nanometre scale. Here, we propose a hierarchical structured silicon anode that tackles all three of these problems. Our design is inspired by the structure of a pomegranate, where single silicon nanoparticles are encapsulated by a conductive carbon layer that leaves enough room for expansion and contraction following lithiation and delithiation. An ensemble of these hybrid nanoparticles is then encapsulated by a thicker carbon layer in micrometre-size pouches to act as an electrolyte barrier. As a result of this hierarchical arrangement, the solid-electrolyte interphase remains stable and spatially confined, resulting in superior cyclability (97% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles). In addition, the microstructures lower the electrode&#8211;electrolyte contact area, resulting in high Coulombic efficiency (99.87%) and volumetric capacity (1,270&#160;mAh&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>), and the cycling remains stable even when the areal capacity is increased to the level of commercial lithium-ion batteries (3.7&#160;mAh&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>).</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Nian Liu']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA', 'authors': ['Zhenda Lu', ',\xa0Jie Zhao', ',\xa0Matthew T.

letter,Biosynthesis of magnetic nanostructures in a foreign organism by transfer of bacterial magnetosome gene clusters,"<p>The synthetic production of monodisperse single magnetic domain nanoparticles at ambient temperature is challenging. In nature, magnetosomes&#8212;membrane-bound magnetic nanocrystals with unprecedented magnetic properties&#8212;can be biomineralized by magnetotactic bacteria. However, these microbes are difficult to handle. Expression of the underlying biosynthetic pathway from these fastidious microorganisms within other organisms could therefore greatly expand their nanotechnological and biomedical applications. So far, this has been hindered by the structural and genetic complexity of the magnetosome organelle and insufficient knowledge of the biosynthetic functions involved. Here, we show that the ability to biomineralize highly ordered magnetic nanostructures can be transferred to a foreign recipient. Expression of a minimal set of genes from the magnetotactic bacterium Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense resulted in magnetosome biosynthesis within the photosynthetic model organism Rhodospirillum rubrum.

letter,Multi-resolution 3D visualization of the early stages of cellular uptake of peptide-coated nanoparticles,"<p>A detailed understanding of the cellular uptake process is essential to the development of cellular delivery strategies and to the study of viral trafficking. However, visualization of the entire process, encompassing the fast dynamics (local to the freely diffusing nanoparticle) as well the state of the larger-scale cellular environment, remains challenging. Here, we introduce a three-dimensional multi-resolution method to capture, in real time, the transient events leading to cellular binding and uptake of peptide (HIV1-Tat)-modified nanoparticles. Applying this new method to observe the landing of nanoparticles on the cellular contour in three dimensions revealed long-range deceleration of the delivery particle, possibly due to interactions with cellular receptors. Furthermore, by using the nanoparticle as a nanoscale &#8216;dynamics pen&#8217;, we discovered an unexpected correlation between small membrane terrain structures and local nanoparticle dynamics.

letter,Prevention of vascular inflammation by nanoparticle targeting of adherent neutrophils,"<p>Inflammatory diseases such as acute lung injury and ischaemic tissue injury are caused by the adhesion of a type of white blood cell&#8212;polymorphonuclear neutrophils&#8212;to the lining of the circulatory system or vascular endothelium and unchecked neutrophil transmigration. Nanoparticle-mediated targeting of activated neutrophils on vascular endothelial cells at the site of injury may be a useful means of directly inactivating neutrophil transmigration and hence mitigating vascular inflammation. Here, we report a method employing drug-loaded albumin nanoparticles, which efficiently deliver drugs into neutrophils adherent to the surface of the inflamed endothelium. Using intravital microscopy of tumour necrosis factor-&#945;-challenged mouse cremaster post-capillary venules, we demonstrate that fluorescently tagged albumin nanoparticles are largely internalized by neutrophils adherent to the activated endothelium via cell surface Fc&#611; receptors. Administration of albumin nanoparticles loaded with the spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, piceatannol, which blocks &#8216;outside-in&#8217; &#946;2 integrin signalling in leukocytes, detached the adherent neutrophils and elicited their release into the circulation. Thus, internalization of drug-loaded albumin nanoparticles into neutrophils inactivates the pro-inflammatory function of activated neutrophils, thereby offering a promising approach for treating inflammatory diseases resulting from inappropriate neutrophil sequestration and activation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, 60612, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Zhenjia Wang', ',\xa0Jing Li', ',\xa0Jaehyung Cho', '\xa0&\xa0Asrar B.

article,An antidamping spin–orbit torque originating from the Berry curvature,"<p>Magnetization switching at the interface between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic metals, controlled by current-induced torques, could be exploited in magnetic memory technologies. Compelling questions arise regarding the role played in the switching by the spin Hall effect in the paramagnet and by the spin&#8211;orbit torque originating from the broken inversion symmetry at the interface. Of particular importance are the antidamping components of these current-induced torques acting against the equilibrium-restoring Gilbert damping of the magnetization dynamics. Here, we report the observation of an antidamping spin&#8211;orbit torque that stems from the Berry curvature, in analogy to the origin of the intrinsic spin Hall effect. We chose the ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As as a material system because its crystal inversion asymmetry allows us to measure bare ferromagnetic films, rather than ferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic heterostructures, eliminating by design any spin Hall effect contribution. We provide an intuitive picture of the Berry curvature origin of this antidamping spin&#8211;orbit torque as well as its microscopic modelling. We expect the Berry curvature spin&#8211;orbit torque to be of comparable strength to the spin-Hall-effect-driven antidamping torque in ferromagnets interfaced with paramagnets with strong intrinsic spin Hall effect.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Microelectronics Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, JJ Thomson Avenue, CB3 0HE, Cambridge, UK', 'authors': ['H.

article,Electrical detection of charge-current-induced spin polarization due to spin-momentum locking in Bi2Se3,"<p>Topological insulators exhibit metallic surface states populated by massless Dirac fermions with spin-momentum locking, where the carrier spin lies in-plane, locked at right angles to the carrier momentum. Here, we show that a charge current produces a net spin polarization via spin-momentum locking in Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> films, and this polarization is directly manifested as a voltage on a ferromagnetic contact. This voltage is proportional to the projection of the spin polarization onto the contact magnetization, is determined by the direction and magnitude of the charge current, scales inversely with Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> film thickness, and its sign is that expected from spin-momentum locking rather than Rashba effects. Similar data are obtained for two different ferromagnetic contacts, demonstrating that these behaviours are independent of the details of the ferromagnetic contact. These results demonstrate direct electrical access to the topological insulators&#8217; surface-state spin system and enable utilization of its remarkable properties for future technological applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Materials Science and Technology Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, 20375, District of Columbia, USA', 'authors': ['C.

article,Surface-stress sensors for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of active free drugs in human serum,"<p>There is a growing appreciation that mechanical signals can be as important as chemical and electrical signals in biology. To include such signals in a systems biology description for understanding pathobiology and developing therapies, quantitative experiments on how solution-phase and surface chemistry together produce biologically relevant mechanical signals are needed. Because of the appearance of drug-resistant hospital &#8216;superbugs&#8217;, there is currently great interest in the destruction of bacteria by bound drug&#8211;target complexes that stress bacterial cell membranes. Here, we use nanomechanical cantilevers as surface-stress sensors, together with equilibrium theory, to describe quantitatively the mechanical response of a surface receptor to different antibiotics in the presence of competing ligands in solution. The antibiotics examined are the standard, Food and Drug Administration-approved drug of last resort, vancomycin, and the yet-to-be approved oritavancin, which shows promise for controlling vancomycin-resistant infections. The work reveals variations among strong and weak competing ligands, such as proteins in human serum, that determine dosages in drug therapies. The findings further enhance our understanding of the biophysical mode of action of the antibiotics and will help develop better treatments, including choice of drugs as well as dosages, against pathogens.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Medicine and Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London, 17–19 Gordon Street, London, WC1H 0AH, UK', 'authors': ['Joseph W.

article,Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles as photoacoustic molecular imaging probes in living mice,"<p>Photoacoustic imaging holds great promise for the visualization of physiology and pathology at the molecular level with deep tissue penetration and fine spatial resolution. To fully utilize this potential, photoacoustic molecular imaging probes have to be developed. Here, we introduce near-infrared light absorbing semiconducting polymer nanoparticles as a new class of contrast agents for photoacoustic molecular imaging. These nanoparticles can produce a stronger signal than the commonly used single-walled carbon nanotubes and gold nanorods on a per mass basis, permitting whole-body lymph-node photoacoustic mapping in living mice at a low systemic injection mass. Furthermore, the semiconducting polymer nanoparticles possess high structural flexibility, narrow photoacoustic spectral profiles and strong resistance to photodegradation and oxidation, enabling the development of the first near-infrared ratiometric photoacoustic probe for in vivo real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species&#8212;vital chemical mediators of many diseases. These results demonstrate semiconducting polymer nanoparticles to be an ideal nanoplatform for developing photoacoustic molecular probes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Radiology, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford, Stanford University School of Medicine, 1201 Welch Road, Stanford, 94305-5484, California, USA', 'authors': ['Kanyi Pu', ',\xa0Adam J.
