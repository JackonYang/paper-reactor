letter,Solar-energy conversion and light emission in an atomic monolayer p–n diode,"<p>The limitations of the bulk semiconductors currently used in electronic devices&#8212;rigidity, heavy weight and high costs&#8212;have recently shifted the research efforts to two-dimensional atomic crystals such as graphene and atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. These materials have the potential to be produced at low cost and in large areas, while maintaining high material quality. These properties, as well as their flexibility, make two-dimensional atomic crystals attractive for applications such as solar cells or display panels. The basic building blocks of optoelectronic devices are p&#8211;n junction diodes, but they have not yet been demonstrated in a two-dimensional material. Here, we report a p&#8211;n junction diode based on an electrostatically doped tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) monolayer. We present applications as a photovoltaic solar cell, a photodiode and a light-emitting diode, and obtain light&#8211;power conversion and electroluminescence efficiencies of &#8764;0.5% and &#8764;0.1%, respectively.

letter,Optoelectronic devices based on electrically tunable p–n diodes in a monolayer dichalcogenide,"<p>The p&#8211;n junction is the functional element of many electronic and optoelectronic devices, including diodes, bipolar transistors, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and solar cells. In conventional p&#8211;n junctions, the adjacent p- and n-type regions of a semiconductor are formed by chemical doping. Ambipolar semiconductors, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires and organic molecules, allow for p&#8211;n junctions to be configured and modified by electrostatic gating. This electrical control enables a single device to have multiple functionalities. Here, we report ambipolar monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> devices in which two local gates are used to define a p&#8211;n junction within the WSe<sub>2</sub> sheet. With these electrically tunable p&#8211;n junctions, we demonstrate both p&#8211;n and n&#8211;p diodes with ideality factors better than 2. Under optical excitation, the diodes demonstrate a photodetection responsivity of 210&#160;mA&#160;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup> and photovoltaic power generation with a peak external quantum efficiency of 0.2%, promising values for a nearly transparent monolayer material in a lateral device geometry.

letter,Electrically tunable excitonic light-emitting diodes based on monolayer WSe2 p–n junctions,"<p>The development of light-emitting diodes with improved efficiency, spectral properties, compactness and integrability is important for lighting, display, optical interconnect, logic and sensor applications. Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides have recently emerged as interesting candidates for optoelectronic applications due to their unique optical properties. Electroluminescence has already been observed from monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> devices. However, the electroluminescence efficiency was low and the linewidth broad due both to the poor optical quality of the MoS<sub>2</sub> and to ineffective contacts. Here, we report electroluminescence from lateral p&#8211;n junctions in monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> induced electrostatically using a thin boron nitride support as a dielectric layer with multiple metal gates beneath. This structure allows effective injection of electrons and holes, and, combined with the high optical quality of WSe<sub>2</sub>, yields bright electroluminescence with 1,000 times smaller injection current and 10 times smaller linewidth than in MoS<sub>2</sub> (refs). Furthermore, by increasing the injection bias we can tune the electroluminescence between regimes of impurity-bound, charged and neutral excitons. This system has the required ingredients for new types of optoelectronic device, such as spin- and valley-polarized light-emitting diodes, on-chip lasers and two-dimensional electro-optic modulators.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, Washington, USA', 'authors': ['Jason S.

letter,Graphene photodetectors with ultra-broadband and high responsivity at room temperature,"<p>The ability to detect light over a broad spectral range is central to several technological applications in imaging, sensing, spectroscopy and communication. Graphene is a promising candidate material for ultra-broadband photodetectors, as its absorption spectrum covers the entire ultraviolet to far-infrared range. However, the responsivity of graphene-based photodetectors has so far been limited to tens of mA&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (refs&#160;) due to the small optical absorption of a monolayer of carbon atoms. Integration of colloidal quantum dots in the light absorption layer can improve the responsivity of graphene photodetectors to &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>7</sup>&#160;A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (ref.&#160;), but the spectral range of photodetection is reduced because light absorption occurs in the quantum dots. Here, we report an ultra-broadband photodetector design based on a graphene double-layer heterostructure. The detector is a phototransistor consisting of a pair of stacked graphene monolayers (top layer, gate; bottom layer, channel) separated by a thin tunnel barrier. Under optical illumination, photoexcited hot carriers generated in the top layer tunnel into the bottom layer, leading to a charge build-up on the gate and a strong photogating effect on the channel conductance. The devices demonstrated room-temperature photodetection from the visible to the mid-infrared range, with mid-infrared responsivity higher than 1&#160;A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, as required by most applications. These results address key challenges for broadband infrared detectors, and are promising for the development of graphene-based hot-carrier optoelectronic applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, 1301 Beal Avenue, Ann Arbor, 48109, Michigan, USA', 'authors': ['Chang-Hua Liu', ',\xa0Theodore B.

letter,Subnanometre resolution in three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging of individual dark spins,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized biomedical science by providing non-invasive, three-dimensional biological imaging. However, spatial resolution in conventional MRI systems is limited to tens of micrometres, which is insufficient for imaging on molecular scales. Here, we demonstrate an MRI technique that provides subnanometre spatial resolution in three dimensions, with single electron-spin sensitivity. Our imaging method works under ambient conditions and can measure ubiquitous &#8216;dark&#8217; spins, which constitute nearly all spin targets of interest. In this technique, the magnetic quantum-projection noise of dark spins is measured using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometer located near the surface of a diamond chip. The distribution of spins surrounding the NV magnetometer is imaged with a scanning magnetic-field gradient. To evaluate the performance of the NV-MRI technique, we image the three-dimensional landscape of electronic spins at the diamond surface and achieve an unprecedented combination of resolution (0.8&#160;nm laterally and 1.5&#160;nm vertically) and single-spin sensitivity. Our measurements uncover electronic spins on the diamond surface that can potentially be used as resources for improved magnetic imaging. This NV-MRI technique is immediately applicable to diverse systems including imaging spin chains, readout of spin-based quantum bits, and determining the location of spin labels in biological systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Harvard University, 17 Oxford Street, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['M.

letter,Random nanolasing in the Anderson localized regime,"<p>The development of nanoscale optical devices for classical and quantum photonics is affected by unavoidable fabrication imperfections that often impose performance limitations. However, disorder may also enable new functionalities, for example in random lasers, where lasing relies on random multiple scattering. The applicability of random lasers has been limited due to multidirectional emission, lack of tunability, and strong mode competition with chaotic fluctuations due to a weak mode confinement. The regime of Anderson localization of light has been proposed for obtaining stable multimode random lasing, and initial work concerned macroscopic one-dimensional layered media. Here, we demonstrate on-chip random nanolasers where the cavity feedback is provided by the intrinsic disorder. The strong confinement achieved by Anderson localization reduces the spatial overlap between lasing modes, thus preventing mode competition and improving stability. This enables highly efficient, stable and broadband wavelength-controlled lasers with very small mode volumes. Furthermore, the complex interplay between gain, dispersion-controlled slow light, and disorder is demonstrated experimentally for a non-conservative random medium. The statistical analysis shows a way towards optimizing random-lasing performance by reducing the localization length, a universal parameter.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Photonics Engineering, DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Ørsteds Plads 343, Lyngby, DK-2800 Kgs, Denmark', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Third-harmonic-upconversion enhancement from a single semiconductor nanoparticle coupled to a plasmonic antenna,"<p>The ability to convert low-energy quanta into a quantum of higher energy is of great interest for a variety of applications, including bioimaging, drug delivery and photovoltaics. Although high conversion efficiencies can be achieved using macroscopic nonlinear crystals, upconverting light at the nanometre scale remains challenging because the subwavelength scale of materials prevents the exploitation of phase-matching processes. Light&#8211;plasmon interactions that occur in nanostructured noble metals have offered alternative opportunities for nonlinear upconversion of infrared light, but conversion efficiency rates remain extremely low due to the weak penetration of the exciting fields into the metal. Here, we show that third-harmonic generation from an individual semiconductor indium tin oxide nanoparticle is significantly enhanced when coupled within a plasmonic gold dimer. The plasmonic dimer acts as a receiving optical antenna, confining the incident far-field radiation into a near field localized at its gap; the indium tin oxide nanoparticle located at the plasmonic dimer gap acts as a localized nonlinear transmitter upconverting three incident photons at frequency &#969; into a photon at frequency 3&#969;. This hybrid nanodevice provides third-harmonic-generation enhancements of up to 10<sup>6</sup>-fold compared with an isolated indium tin oxide nanoparticle, with an effective third-order susceptibility up to 3.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>3</sup>&#160;nm&#160;V<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and conversion efficiency of 0.0007%. We also show that the upconverted third-harmonic emission can be exploited to probe the near-field intensity at the plasmonic dimer gap.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, The Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, UK', 'authors': ['Heykel Aouani', ',\xa0Mohsen Rahmani', '\xa0&\xa0Stefan A.

letter,Three-dimensional manipulation with scanning near-field optical nanotweezers,"<p>Recent advances in nanotechnologies have prompted the need for tools to accurately and non-invasively manipulate individual nano-objects. Among the possible strategies, optical forces have been predicted to provide researchers with nano-optical tweezers capable of trapping a specimen and moving it in three dimensions. In practice, however, the combination of weak optical forces and photothermal issues has thus far prevented their experimental realization. Here, we demonstrate the first three-dimensional optical manipulation of single 50&#160;nm dielectric objects with near-field nanotweezers. The nano-optical trap is built by engineering a bowtie plasmonic aperture at the extremity of a tapered metal-coated optical fibre. Both the trapping operation and monitoring are performed through the optical fibre, making these nanotweezers totally autonomous and free of bulky optical elements. The achieved trapping performances allow for the trapped specimen to be moved over tens of micrometres over a period of several minutes with very low in-trap intensities. This non-invasive approach is foreseen to open new horizons in nanosciences by offering an unprecedented level of control of nanosized objects, including heat-sensitive biospecimens.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ICFO – Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, 08860, Castelldefels (Barcelona), Spain', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Engineering bright sub-10-nm upconverting nanocrystals for single-molecule imaging,"<p>Imaging at the single-molecule level reveals heterogeneities that are lost in ensemble imaging experiments, but an ongoing challenge is the development of luminescent probes with the photostability, brightness and continuous emission necessary for single-molecule microscopy.

However, the brightness of upconverting nanoparticles has been limited by open questions about energy transfer and relaxation within individual nanocrystals and unavoidable tradeoffs between brightness and size. Here, we develop upconverting nanoparticles under 10&#160;nm in diameter that are over an order of magnitude brighter under single-particle imaging conditions than existing compositions, allowing us to visualize single upconverting nanoparticles as small (d&#160;=&#160;4.8&#160;nm) as fluorescent proteins. We use advanced single-particle characterization and theoretical modelling to find that surface effects become critical at diameters under 20&#160;nm and that the fluences used in single-molecule imaging change the dominant determinants of nanocrystal brightness. These results demonstrate that factors known to increase brightness in bulk experiments lose importance at higher excitation powers and that, paradoxically, the brightest probes under single-molecule excitation are barely luminescent at the ensemble level.</p>",,"[{'address': '', 'authors': ['P.

letter,All-water-based electron-beam lithography using silk as a resist,"<p>Traditional nanofabrication techniques often require complex lithographic steps and the use of toxic chemicals. To move from the laboratory scale to large scales, nanofabrication should be carried out using alternative procedures that are simple, inexpensive and use non-toxic solvents. Recent efforts have focused on nanoimprinting and the use of organic resists (such as quantum dot&#8211;polymer hybrids, DNA and poly(ethylene glycol)), which still require, for the most part, noxious chemicals for processing. Significant advances have been achieved using &#8216;green&#8217; resists that can be developed with water, but so far these approaches have suffered from low electron sensitivity, line edge roughness and scalability constraints. Here, we present the use of silk as a natural and biofunctional resist for electron-beam lithography. The process is entirely water-based, starting with the silk aqueous solution and ending with simple development of the exposed silk film in water. Because of its polymorphic crystalline structure, silk can be used either as a positive or negative resist through interactions with an electron beam. Moreover, silk can be easily modified, thereby enabling a variety of &#8216;functional resists&#8217;, including biologically active versions. As a proof of principle of the viability of all-water-based silk electron-beam lithography (EBL), we fabricate nanoscale photonic lattices using both neat silk and silk doped with quantum dots, green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) or horseradish peroxidase (HRP).</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tufts University, 4 Colby Street, Medford, 02155, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Sunghwan Kim', ',\xa0Benedetto Marelli', ',\xa0Mark A.

letter,Biogenic gas nanostructures as ultrasonic molecular reporters,"<p>Ultrasound is among the most widely used non-invasive imaging modalities in biomedicine, but plays a surprisingly small role in molecular imaging due to a lack of suitable molecular reporters on the nanoscale. Here, we introduce a new class of reporters for ultrasound based on genetically encoded gas nanostructures from microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. Gas vesicles are gas-filled protein-shelled compartments with typical widths of 45&#8211;250&#160;nm and lengths of 100&#8211;600&#160;nm that exclude water and are permeable to gas. We show that gas vesicles produce stable ultrasound contrast that is readily detected in vitro and in vivo, that their genetically encoded physical properties enable multiple modes of imaging, and that contrast enhancement through aggregation permits their use as molecular biosensors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Miller Research Institute, University of California at Berkeley, 2536 Channing Way, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['Mikhail G.

article,Nanofluidic transport governed by the liquid/vapour interface,"<p>Liquid/vapour interfaces govern the behaviour of a wide range of systems but remain poorly understood, leaving ample margin for the exploitation of intriguing functionalities for applications. Here, we systematically investigate the role of liquid/vapour interfaces in the transport of water across apposing liquid menisci in osmosis membranes comprising short hydrophobic nanopores that separate two fluid reservoirs. We show experimentally that mass transport is limited by molecular reflection from the liquid/vapour interface below a certain length scale, which depends on the transmission probability of water molecules across the nanopores and on the condensation probability of a water molecule incident on the liquid surface. This fundamental yet elusive condensation property of water is measured under near-equilibrium conditions and found to decrease from 0.36&#160;&#177;&#160;0.21 at 30&#160;&#176;C to 0.18&#160;&#177;&#160;0.09 at 60&#160;&#176;C. These findings define the regime in which liquid/vapour interfaces govern nanofluidic transport and have implications for understanding mass transport in nanofluidic devices, droplets and bubbles, biological components and porous media involving liquid/vapour interfaces.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Jongho Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Rohit Karnik']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia', 'authors': ['Tahar Laoui']}]",False,"['Jongho Lee', 'Tahar Laoui', 'Rohit Karnik']","Lee, J., Laoui, T. & Karnik, R.
