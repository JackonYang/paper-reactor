letter,Observation of the magnetic flux and three-dimensional structure of skyrmion lattices by electron holography,"<p>Skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that are viewed as promising candidates as information carriers in future spintronic devices. Skyrmions have been observed using neutron scattering and microscopy techniques. Real-space imaging using electrons is a straightforward way to interpret spin configurations by detecting the phase shifts due to electromagnetic fields. Here, we report the first observation by electron holography of the magnetic flux and the three-dimensional spin configuration of a skyrmion lattice in Fe<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>0.5</sub>Si thin samples. The magnetic flux inside and outside a skyrmion was directly visualized and the handedness of the magnetic flux flow was found to be dependent on the direction of the applied magnetic field. The electron phase shifts &#966; in the helical and skyrmion phases were determined using samples with a stepped thickness t (from 55&#160;nm to 510&#160;nm), revealing a linear relationship (&#966;&#160;=&#160;0.00173t). The phase measurements were used to estimate the three-dimensional structures of both the helical and skyrmion phases, demonstrating that electron holography is a useful tool for studying complex magnetic structures and for three-dimensional, real-space mapping of magnetic fields.</p>",,"[{'address': 'RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan', 'authors': ['Hyun Soon Park', ',\xa0Xiuzhen Yu', ',\xa0Shinji Aizawa', ',\xa0Toshiaki Tanigaki', ',\xa0Daisuke Shindo', '\xa0&\xa0Yoshinori Tokura']}, {'address': 'Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd, 2520 Akanuma, Hatoyama-machi, Hiki-gun, Hatoyama, Saitama, 350-0395, Japan', 'authors': ['Tetsuya Akashi', ',\xa0Yoshio Takahashi', '\xa0&\xa0Akira Tonomura']}, {'address': 'Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-1-8, Honcho, Kawaguchi-shi, Saitama, 332-0012, Japan', 'authors': ['Tsuyoshi Matsuda']}, {'address': 'Department of Applied Physics and Quantum-Phase Electronics Center (QPEC), University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan', 'authors': ['Naoya Kanazawa', '\xa0&\xa0Yoshinori Tokura']}, {'address': 'Department of Basic Science, University of Tokyo, 3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-8902, Japan', 'authors': ['Yoshinori Onose']}, {'address': 'Interdisciplinary Materials Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, 1-1-2-chome, Katahira, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 332-0012, Japan', 'authors': ['Daisuke Shindo']}]",False,"['Hyun Soon Park', 'Xiuzhen Yu', 'Shinji Aizawa', 'Toshiaki Tanigaki', 'Tetsuya Akashi', 'Yoshio Takahashi', 'Tsuyoshi Matsuda', 'Naoya Kanazawa', 'Yoshinori Onose', 'Daisuke Shindo', 'Akira Tonomura', 'Yoshinori Tokura']","Park, H., Yu, X., Aizawa, S. et al.

letter,The effect of spin transport on spin lifetime in nanoscale systems,"<p>Spintronics use the electron spin as a state variable for information processing and storage. This requires manipulation of spin ensembles for data encoding, and spin transport for information transfer. Because of the central importance of lifetime for understanding and controlling spins, mechanisms that determine this lifetime in bulk systems have been extensively studied. However, a clear understanding of few-spin systems remains challenging. Here, we report spatially resolved magnetic resonance studies of electron spin ensembles confined to a &#8216;spin nanowire&#8217; formed by nitrogen ion implantation in diamond. We measure the spin lifetime of the ensemble&#8212;that is, its spin autocorrelation time&#8212;by monitoring the statistical fluctuations of its net moment, which is in thermal equilibrium and has no imposed polarization gradient. We find that the lifetime of the ensemble is dominated by spin transport from the ensemble into the adjacent spin reservoir that is provided by the remainder of the nanowire. This is in striking contrast to conventional spin-lattice relaxation measurements of isolated spin ensembles. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy performed on nanoscale spin ensembles by means of a novel spin manipulation protocol corroborates spin transport in strong field gradients. Our experiments, supported by microscopic Monte Carlo modelling, provide a unique insight into the intrinsic dynamics of pure spin currents needed for nanoscale devices that seek to control spins.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Ohio State University, Columbus, 43210, Ohio, USA', 'authors': ['Jeremy Cardellino', ',\xa0Nicolas Scozzaro', ',\xa0Michael Herman', ',\xa0Andrew J.

letter,Photoinduced doping in heterostructures of graphene and boron nitride,"<p>The design of stacks of layered materials in which adjacent layers interact by van der Waals forces has enabled the combination of various two-dimensional crystals with different electrical, optical and mechanical properties as well as the emergence of novel physical phenomena and device functionality. Here, we report photoinduced doping in van der Waals heterostructures consisting of graphene and boron nitride layers. It enables flexible and repeatable writing and erasing of charge doping in graphene with visible light. We demonstrate that this photoinduced doping maintains the high carrier mobility of the graphene/boron nitride heterostructure, thus resembling the modulation doping technique used in semiconductor heterojunctions, and can be used to generate spatially varying doping profiles such as p&#8211;n junctions. We show that this photoinduced doping arises from microscopically coupled optical and electrical responses of graphene/boron nitride heterostructures, including optical excitation of defect transitions in boron nitride, electrical transport in graphene, and charge transfer between boron nitride and graphene.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA', 'authors': ['L.

letter,Universal computing by DNA origami robots in a living animal,"<p>Biological systems are collections of discrete molecular objects that move around and collide with each other. Cells carry out elaborate processes by precisely controlling these collisions, but developing artificial machines that can interface with and control such interactions remains a significant challenge. DNA is a natural substrate for computing and has been used to implement a diverse set of mathematical problems, logic circuits and robotics. The molecule also interfaces naturally with living systems, and different forms of DNA-based biocomputing have already been demonstrated. Here, we show that DNA origami can be used to fabricate nanoscale robots that are capable of dynamically interacting with each other in a living animal. The interactions generate logical outputs, which are relayed to switch molecular payloads on or off. As a proof of principle, we use the system to create architectures that emulate various logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOT, CNOT and a half adder). Following an ex vivo prototyping phase, we successfully used the DNA origami robots in living cockroaches (Blaberus discoidalis) to control a molecule that targets their cells.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Faculty of Life Sciences and the Institute of Nanotechnology & Advanced Materials, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, 52900, Israel', 'authors': ['Yaniv Amir', ',\xa0Eldad Ben-Ishay', ',\xa0Shmulik Ittah', ',\xa0Almogit Abu-Horowitz', '\xa0&\xa0Ido Bachelet']}, {'address': 'Wyss Institute for Bio-Inspired Engineering, Harvard Medical School, 3 Blackfan Circle, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA', 'authors': ['Daniel Levner']}]",False,"['Yaniv Amir', 'Eldad Ben-Ishay', 'Daniel Levner', 'Shmulik Ittah', 'Almogit Abu-Horowitz', 'Ido Bachelet']","Amir, Y., Ben-Ishay, E., Levner, D. et al.

article,Dynamic relaxation of a levitated nanoparticle from a non-equilibrium steady state,"<p>Fluctuation theorems are a generalization of thermodynamics on small scales and provide the tools to characterize the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities in non-equilibrium nanoscale systems. They are particularly important for understanding irreversibility and the second law in fundamental chemical and biological processes that are actively driven, thus operating far from thermal equilibrium. Here, we apply the framework of fluctuation theorems to investigate the important case of a system relaxing from a non-equilibrium state towards equilibrium. Using a vacuum-trapped nanoparticle, we demonstrate experimentally the validity of a fluctuation theorem for the relative entropy change occurring during relaxation from a non-equilibrium steady state. The platform established here allows non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems to be studied experimentally for arbitrary steady states and can be extended to investigate quantum fluctuation theorems as well as systems that do not obey detailed balance.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ICFO–Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, Castelldefels (Barcelona), 08860, Spain', 'authors': ['Jan Gieseler', '\xa0&\xa0Romain Quidant']}, {'address': 'ICREA–Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, Barcelona, 08010, Spain', 'authors': ['Romain Quidant']}, {'address': 'University of Vienna, Faculty of Physics, Boltzmanngasse 5, Wien, 1090, Austria', 'authors': ['Christoph Dellago']}, {'address': 'ETH Zürich, Photonics Laboratory, Zürich, 8093, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Lukas Novotny']}]",False,"['Jan Gieseler', 'Romain Quidant', 'Christoph Dellago', 'Lukas Novotny']","Gieseler, J., Quidant, R., Dellago, C. et al.

article,Electronic control of optical Anderson localization modes,"<p>Anderson localization of light has been demonstrated in a few different dielectric materials and lithographically fabricated structures. However, such localization is difficult to control, and requires strong magnetic fields or nonlinear optical effects, and electronic control has not been demonstrated. Here, we show control of optical Anderson localization using charge carriers injected into more than 100 submicrometre-scale p&#8211;n diodes. The diodes are embedded into the cross-section of the optical waveguide and are fabricated with a technology compatible with the current electronics industry. Large variations in the output signal, exceeding a factor of 100, were measured with 1&#160;V and a control current of 1&#160;mA. The transverse footprint of our device is only 0.125&#160;&#181;m<sup>2</sup>, about five orders of magnitude smaller than optical two-dimensional lattices.

article,Generating electricity by moving a droplet of ionic liquid along graphene,"<p>Since the early nineteenth century, it has been known that an electric potential can be generated by driving an ionic liquid through fine channels or holes under a pressure gradient. More recently, it has been reported that carbon nanotubes can generate a voltage when immersed in flowing liquids, but the exact origin of these observations is unclear, and generating electricity without a pressure gradient remains a challenge. Here, we show that a voltage of a few millivolts can be produced by moving a droplet of sea water or ionic solution over a strip of monolayer graphene under ambient conditions. Through experiments and density functional theory calculations, we find that a pseudocapacitor is formed at the droplet/graphene interface, which is driven forward by the moving droplet, charging and discharging at the front and rear of the droplet. This gives rise to an electric potential that is proportional to the velocity and number of droplets. The potential is also found to be dependent on the concentration and ionic species of the droplet, and decreases sharply with an increasing number of graphene layers. We illustrate the potential of this electrokinetic phenomenon by using it to create a handwriting sensor and an energy-harvesting device.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Control of Mechanical Structures, Key Laboratory for Intelligent Nano Materials and Devices of the Ministry of Education, and Institute of Nanoscience, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 29 Yudao Street, Nanjing, 210016, China', 'authors': ['Jun Yin', ',\xa0Xuemei Li', ',\xa0Jin Yu', ',\xa0Zhuhua Zhang', ',\xa0Jianxin Zhou', '\xa0&\xa0Wanlin Guo']}]",False,"['Jun Yin', 'Xuemei Li', 'Jin Yu', 'Zhuhua Zhang', 'Jianxin Zhou', 'Wanlin Guo']","Yin, J., Li, X., Yu, J. et al.

article,High thermal conductivity of chain-oriented amorphous polythiophene,"<p>Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators, because the amorphous arrangement of the molecular chains reduces the mean free path of heat-conducting phonons. The most common method to increase thermal conductivity is to draw polymeric fibres, which increases chain alignment and crystallinity, but creates a material that currently has limited thermal applications. Here we show that pure polythiophene nanofibres can have a thermal conductivity up to &#8764;4.4 W m<sup>&#8211;1</sup>&#160;K<sup>&#8211;1</sup> (more than 20 times higher than the bulk polymer value) while remaining amorphous. This enhancement results from significant molecular chain orientation along the fibre axis that is obtained during electropolymerization using nanoscale templates. Thermal conductivity data suggest that, unlike in drawn crystalline fibres, in our fibres the dominant phonon-scattering process at room temperature is still related to structural disorder. Using vertically aligned arrays of nanofibres, we demonstrate effective heat transfer at critical contacts in electronic devices operating under high-power conditions at 200&#160;&#176;C over numerous cycles.</p>",,"[{'address': 'George W.

article,Atomic mechanism of the semiconducting-to-metallic phase transition in single-layered MoS2,"<p>Phase transitions can be used to alter the properties of a material without adding any additional atoms and are therefore of significant technological value. In a solid, phase transitions involve collective atomic displacements, but such atomic processes have so far only been investigated using macroscopic approaches. Here, we show that in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy can be used to follow the structural transformation between semiconducting (2H) and metallic (1T) phases in single-layered MoS<sub>2</sub>, with atomic resolution. The 2H/1T phase transition involves gliding atomic planes of sulphur and/or molybdenum and requires an intermediate phase (&#945;-phase) as a precursor. The migration of two kinds of boundaries (&#946;- and &#947;-boundaries) is also found to be responsible for the growth of the second phase. Furthermore, we show that areas of the 1T phase can be controllably grown in a layer of the 2H phase using an electron beam.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, 305-8565, Japan', 'authors': ['Yung-Chang Lin', '\xa0&\xa0Kazu Suenaga']}, {'address': 'Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, 10607, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Dumitru O.

article,Multifunctional wearable devices for diagnosis and therapy of movement disorders,"<p>Wearable systems that monitor muscle activity, store data and deliver feedback therapy are the next frontier in personalized medicine and healthcare. However, technical challenges, such as the fabrication of high-performance, energy-efficient sensors and memory modules that are in intimate mechanical contact with soft tissues, in conjunction with controlled delivery of therapeutic agents, limit the wide-scale adoption of such systems. Here, we describe materials, mechanics and designs for multifunctional, wearable-on-the-skin systems that address these challenges via monolithic integration of nanomembranes fabricated with a top-down approach, nanoparticles assembled by bottom-up methods, and stretchable electronics on a tissue-like polymeric substrate. Representative examples of such systems include physiological sensors, non-volatile memory and drug-release actuators. Quantitative analyses of the electronics, mechanics, heat-transfer and drug-diffusion characteristics validate the operation of individual components, thereby enabling system-level multifunctionalities.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Nanoparticle Research, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Seoul, 151-742, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Donghee Son', ',\xa0Jongha Lee', ',\xa0Jaemin Kim', ',\xa0Ji Eun Lee', ',\xa0Changyeong Song', ',\xa0Seok Joo Kim', ',\xa0Dong Jun Lee', ',\xa0Samuel Woojoo Jun', ',\xa0Minjoon Park', ',\xa0Jiho Shin', ',\xa0Kyungsik Do', ',\xa0Mincheol Lee', ',\xa0Kwanghun Kang', ',\xa0Taeghwan Hyeon', '\xa0&\xa0Dae-Hyeong Kim']}, {'address': 'School of Chemical and Biological Engineering and Institute of Chemical Processes, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-742, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Donghee Son', ',\xa0Jongha Lee', ',\xa0Jaemin Kim', ',\xa0Ji Eun Lee', ',\xa0Changyeong Song', ',\xa0Seok Joo Kim', ',\xa0Dong Jun Lee', ',\xa0Samuel Woojoo Jun', ',\xa0Minjoon Park', ',\xa0Jiho Shin', ',\xa0Kyungsik Do', ',\xa0Mincheol Lee', ',\xa0Kwanghun Kang', ',\xa0Taeghwan Hyeon', '\xa0&\xa0Dae-Hyeong Kim']}, {'address': 'Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Center for Mechanics of Solids, Structures and Materials, Texas Materials Institute, University of Texas at Austin, 210 E 24th Street, Austin, 78712, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Shutao Qiao', ',\xa0Shixuan Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Nanshu Lu']}, {'address': 'MC10 Inc., 9 Camp Street, Cambridge, 02140, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Roozbeh Ghaffari']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center, WCU Hybrid Materials Program, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-744, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Cheol Seong Hwang']}]",False,"['Donghee Son', 'Jongha Lee', 'Shutao Qiao', 'Roozbeh Ghaffari', 'Jaemin Kim', 'Ji Eun Lee', 'Changyeong Song', 'Seok Joo Kim', 'Dong Jun Lee', 'Samuel Woojoo Jun', 'Shixuan Yang', 'Minjoon Park', 'Jiho Shin', 'Kyungsik Do', 'Mincheol Lee', 'Kwanghun Kang', 'Cheol Seong Hwang', 'Nanshu Lu', 'Taeghwan Hyeon', 'Dae-Hyeong Kim']","Son, D., Lee, J., Qiao, S. et al.
