letter,Spin blockade and exchange in Coulomb-confined silicon double quantum dots,"<p>Electron spins confined to phosphorus donors in silicon are promising candidates as qubits because of their long coherence times, exceeding seconds in isotopically purified bulk silicon. With the recent demonstrations of initialization, readout and coherent manipulation of individual donor electron spins, the next challenge towards the realization of a Si:P donor-based quantum computer is the demonstration of exchange coupling in two tunnel-coupled phosphorus donors. Spin-to-charge conversion via Pauli spin blockade, an essential ingredient for reading out individual spin states, is challenging in donor-based systems due to the inherently large donor charging energies (&#8764;45 meV), requiring large electric fields (&gt;1 MV m<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) to transfer both electron spins onto the same donor. Here, in a carefully characterized double donor-dot device, we directly observe spin blockade of the first few electrons and measure the effective exchange interaction between electron spins in coupled Coulomb-confined systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Bent Weber"", ""Y.

letter,Atomic-scale control of competing electronic phases in ultrathin LaNiO3,"<p>In an effort to scale down electronic devices to atomic dimensions, the use of transition-metal oxides may provide advantages over conventional semiconductors. Their high carrier densities and short electronic length scales are desirable for miniaturization, while strong interactions that mediate exotic phase diagrams open new avenues for engineering emergent properties. Nevertheless, understanding how their correlated electronic states can be manipulated at the nanoscale remains challenging. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to uncover an abrupt destruction of Fermi liquid-like quasiparticles in the correlated metal LaNiO<sub>3</sub> when confined to a critical film thickness of two unit cells. This is accompanied by the onset of an insulating phase as measured by electrical transport. We show how this is driven by an instability to an incipient order of the underlying quantum many-body system, demonstrating the power of artificial confinement to harness control over competing phases in complex oxides with atomic-scale precision.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

letter,Nanophotonic trapping for precise manipulation of biomolecular arrays,"<p>Optical trapping is a powerful manipulation and measurement technique widely used in the biological and materials sciences. Miniaturizing optical trap instruments onto optofluidic platforms holds promise for high-throughput lab-on-a-chip applications. However, a persistent challenge with existing optofluidic devices has been achieving controlled and precise manipulation of trapped particles. Here, we report a new class of on-chip optical trapping devices. Using photonic interference functionalities, an array of stable, three-dimensional on-chip optical traps is formed at the antinodes of a standing-wave evanescent field on a nanophotonic waveguide. By employing the thermo-optic effect via integrated electric microheaters, the traps can be repositioned at high speed (&#8764;30 kHz) with nanometre precision. We demonstrate sorting and manipulation of individual DNA molecules. In conjunction with laminar flows and fluorescence, we also show precise control of the chemical environment of a sample with simultaneous monitoring. Such a controllable trapping device has the potential to achieve high-throughput precision measurements on chip.</p>",[],False,"[""Mohammad Soltani"", ""Jun Lin"", ""Robert A. Forties"", ""James T.

article,Subnanosecond incubation times for electric-field-induced metallization of a correlated electron oxide,"<p>Strong interactions, or correlations, between the d or f electrons in transition-metal oxides lead to various types of metal&#8211;insulator transitions that can be triggered by external parameters such as temperature, pressure, doping, magnetic fields and electric fields. Electric-field-induced metallization of such materials from their insulating states could enable a new class of ultrafast electronic switches and latches. However, significant questions remain about the detailed nature of the switching process. Here, we show, in the canonical metal-to-insulator transition system V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, that ultrafast voltage pulses result in its metallization only after an incubation time that ranges from &#8764;150 ps to many nanoseconds, depending on the electric field strength. We show that these incubation times can be accounted for by purely thermal effects and that intrinsic electronic-switching mechanisms may only be revealed using larger electric fields at even shorter timescales.</p>",[],False,"[""Justin S.

article,Selective molecular recognition by nanoscale environments in a supported iridium cluster catalyst,"<p>The active sites of enzymes are contained within nanoscale environments that exhibit exquisite levels of specificity to particular molecules. The development of such nanoscale environments on synthetic surfaces, which would be capable of discriminating between molecules that would nominally bind in a similar way to the surface, could be of use in nanosensing, selective catalysis and gas separation. However, mimicking such subtle behaviour, even crudely, with a synthetic system remains a significant challenge. Here, we show that the reactive sites on the surface of a tetrairidium cluster can be controlled by using three calixarene&#8211;phosphine ligands to create a selective nanoscale environment at the metal surface. Each ligand is 1.4&#160;nm in length and envelopes the cluster core in a manner that discriminates between the reactivities of the basal-plane and apical iridium atoms. CO ligands are initially present on the clusters and can be selectively removed from the basal-plane sites by thermal dissociation and from the apical sites by reactive decarbonylation with the bulky reactant trimethylamine-N-oxide. Both steps lead to the creation of metal sites that can bind CO molecules, but only the reactive decarbonylation step creates vacancies that are also able to bond to ethylene, and catalyse its hydrogenation.</p>",[],False,"[""Alexander Okrut"", ""Ron C.

article,Single-molecule spectroscopy of amino acids and peptides by recognition tunnelling,"<p>The human proteome has millions of protein variants due to alternative RNA splicing and post-translational modifications, and variants that are related to diseases are frequently present in minute concentrations. For DNA and RNA, low concentrations can be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, but there is no such reaction for proteins. Therefore, the development of single-molecule protein sequencing is a critical step in the search for protein biomarkers. Here, we show that single amino acids can be identified by trapping the molecules between two electrodes that are coated with a layer of recognition molecules, then measuring the electron tunnelling current across the junction. A given molecule can bind in more than one way in the junction, and we therefore use a machine-learning algorithm to distinguish between the sets of electronic &#8216;fingerprints&#8217; associated with each binding motif. With this recognition tunnelling technique, we are able to identify D and L enantiomers, a methylated amino acid, isobaric isomers and short peptides. The results suggest that direct electronic sequencing of single proteins could be possible by sequentially measuring the products of processive exopeptidase digestion, or by using a molecular motor to pull proteins through a tunnel junction integrated with a nanopore.</p>",[],False,"[""Yanan Zhao"", ""Brian Ashcroft"", ""Peiming Zhang"", ""Hao Liu"", ""Suman Sen"", ""Weisi Song"", ""JongOne Im"", ""Brett Gyarfas"", ""Saikat Manna"", ""Sovan Biswas"", ""Chad Borges"", ""Stuart Lindsay""]","Zhao, Y., Ashcroft, B., Zhang, P. et al.

article,Quantitative imaging of single mRNA splice variants in living cells,"<p>Alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing is a fundamental process of gene regulation, and errors in RNA splicing are known to be associated with a variety of different diseases. However, there is currently a lack of quantitative technologies for monitoring mRNA splice variants in cells. Here, we show that a combination of plasmonic dimer probes and hyperspectral imaging can be used to detect and quantify mRNA splice variants in living cells. The probes are made from gold nanoparticles functionalized with oligonucleotides and can hybridize to specific mRNA sequences, forming nanoparticle dimers that exhibit distinct spectral shifts due to plasmonic coupling. With this approach, we show that the spatial and temporal distribution of three selected splice variants of the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, can be monitored at single-copy resolution by measuring the hybridization dynamics of the nanoplasmonic dimers. Our study provides insights into RNA and its transport in living cells, which could improve our understanding of cellular protein complexes, pharmacogenomics, genetic diagnosis and gene therapies.</p>",[],False,"[""Kyuwan Lee"", ""Yi Cui"", ""Luke P.

article,Selective uptake of single-walled carbon nanotubes by circulating monocytes for enhanced tumour delivery,"<p>In cancer imaging, nanoparticle biodistribution is typically visualized in living subjects using &#8216;bulk&#8217; imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography and whole-body fluorescence. Accordingly, nanoparticle influx is observed only macroscopically, and the mechanisms by which they target cancer remain elusive. Nanoparticles are assumed to accumulate via several targeting mechanisms, particularly extravasation (leakage into tumour). Here, we show that, in addition to conventional nanoparticle-uptake mechanisms, single-walled carbon nanotubes are almost exclusively taken up by a single immune cell subset, Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (almost 100% uptake in Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, below 3% in all other circulating cells), and delivered to the tumour in mice. We also demonstrate that a targeting ligand (RGD) conjugated to nanotubes significantly enhances the number of single-walled carbon nanotube-loaded monocytes reaching the tumour (P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.001, day&#160;7&#160;post-injection).
