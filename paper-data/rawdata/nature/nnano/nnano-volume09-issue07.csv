article,Metamaterial mirrors in optoelectronic devices,"<p>The phase reversal that occurs when light is reflected from a metallic mirror produces a standing wave with reduced intensity near the reflective surface. This effect is highly undesirable in optoelectronic devices that use metal films as both electrical contacts and optical mirrors, because it dictates a minimum spacing between the metal and the underlying active semiconductor layers, therefore posing a fundamental limit to the overall thickness of the device. Here, we show that this challenge can be circumvented by using a metamaterial mirror whose reflection phase is tunable from that of a perfect electric mirror (&#966;&#160;=&#160;&#960;) to that of a perfect magnetic mirror (&#966; = 0). This tunability in reflection phase can also be exploited to optimize the standing wave profile in planar devices to maximize light&#8211;matter interaction. Specifically, we show that light absorption and photocurrent generation in a sub-100 nm active semiconductor layer of a model solar cell can be enhanced by &#8764;20% over a broad spectral band.</p>",[],False,"[""Majid Esfandyarpour"", ""Erik C.

article,Switching of perpendicular magnetization by spin–orbit torques in the absence of external magnetic fields,"<p>Magnetization switching by current-induced spin&#8211;orbit torques is of great interest due to its potential applications in ultralow-power memory and logic devices. The switching of ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetization is of particular technological relevance. However, in such materials, the presence of an in-plane external magnetic field is typically required to assist spin&#8211;orbit torque-driven switching and this is an obstacle for practical applications. Here, we report the switching of out-of-plane magnetized Ta/Co<sub>20</sub>Fe<sub>60</sub>B<sub>20</sub>/TaO<sub>x</sub> structures by spin&#8211;orbit torques driven by in-plane currents, without the need for any external magnetic fields. This is achieved by introducing a lateral structural asymmetry into our devices, which gives rise to a new field-like spin&#8211;orbit torque when in-plane current flows in these structures. The direction of the current-induced effective field corresponding to this field-like spin&#8211;orbit torque is out-of-plane, facilitating the switching of perpendicular magnets.</p>",[],False,"[""Guoqiang Yu"", ""Pramey Upadhyaya"", ""Yabin Fan"", ""Juan G.

article,Scalable synthesis of hierarchically structured carbon nanotube–graphene fibres for capacitive energy storage,"<p>Micro-supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices that can complement or even replace batteries in miniaturized portable electronics and microelectromechanical systems. Their main limitation, however, is the low volumetric energy density when compared with batteries. Here, we describe a hierarchically structured carbon microfibre made of an interconnected network of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes with interposed nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets. The nanomaterials form mesoporous structures of large specific surface area (396&#160;m<sup>2</sup>&#160;g<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and high electrical conductivity (102&#160;S&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). We develop a scalable method to continuously produce the fibres using a silica capillary column functioning as a hydrothermal microreactor. The resultant fibres show a specific volumetric capacity as high as 305&#160;F&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup> in sulphuric acid (measured at 73.5&#160;mA&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup> in a three-electrode cell) or 300&#160;F&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup> in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> electrolyte (measured at 26.7&#160;mA&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup> in a two-electrode cell). A full micro-supercapacitor with PVA/H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> gel electrolyte, free from binder, current collector and separator, has a volumetric energy density of &#8764;6.3 mWh cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup> (a value comparable to that of 4&#160;V&#8211;500&#160;&#181;Ah thin-film lithium batteries) while maintaining a power density more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of batteries, as well as a long cycle life. To demonstrate that our fibre-based, all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors can be easily integrated into miniaturized flexible devices, we use them to power an ultraviolet photodetector and a light-emitting diode.</p>",[],False,"[""Dingshan Yu"", ""Kunli Goh"", ""Hong Wang"", ""Li Wei"", ""Wenchao Jiang"", ""Qiang Zhang"", ""Liming Dai"", ""Yuan Chen""]","Yu, D., Goh, K., Wang, H. et al.
