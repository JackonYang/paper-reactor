article,Valley-dependent spin polarization in bulk MoS2 with broken inversion symmetry,"<p>The valley degree of freedom of electrons is attracting growing interest as a carrier of information in various materials, including graphene, diamond and monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides. The monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides are semiconducting and are unique due to the coupling between the spin and valley degrees of freedom originating from the relativistic spin&#8211;orbit interaction. Here, we report the direct observation of valley-dependent out-of-plane spin polarization in an archetypal transition-metal dichalcogenide&#8212;MoS<sub>2</sub>&#8212;using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The result is in fair agreement with a first-principles theoretical prediction. This was made possible by choosing a 3R polytype crystal, which has a non-centrosymmetric structure, rather than the conventional centrosymmetric 2H form. We also confirm robust valley polarization in the 3R form by means of circularly polarized photoluminescence spectroscopy. Non-centrosymmetric transition-metal dichalcogenide crystals may provide a firm basis for the development of magnetic and electric manipulation of spin/valley degrees of freedom.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

article,Interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres for stable lithium metal anodes,"<p>For future applications in portable electronics, electric vehicles and grid storage, batteries with higher energy storage density than existing lithium ion batteries need to be developed. Recent efforts in this direction have focused on high-capacity electrode materials such as lithium metal, silicon and tin as anodes, and sulphur and oxygen as cathodes. Lithium metal would be the optimal choice as an anode material, because it has the highest specific capacity (3,860&#8197;mAh&#8197;g<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) and the lowest anode potential of all. However, the lithium anode forms dendritic and mossy metal deposits, leading to serious safety concerns and low Coulombic efficiency during charge/discharge cycles. Although advanced characterization techniques have helped shed light on the lithium growth process, effective strategies to improve lithium metal anode cycling remain elusive. Here, we show that coating the lithium metal anode with a monolayer of interconnected amorphous hollow carbon nanospheres helps isolate the lithium metal depositions and facilitates the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase. We show that lithium dendrites do not form up to a practical current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8197;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup>. The Coulombic efficiency improves to &#8764;99% for more than 150 cycles. This is significantly better than the bare unmodified samples, which usually show rapid Coulombic efficiency decay in fewer than 100 cycles. Our results indicate that nanoscale interfacial engineering could be a promising strategy to tackle the intrinsic problems of lithium metal anodes.</p>",[],False,"[""Guangyuan Zheng"", ""Seok Woo Lee"", ""Zheng Liang"", ""Hyun-Wook Lee"", ""Kai Yan"", ""Hongbin Yao"", ""Haotian Wang"", ""Weiyang Li"", ""Steven Chu"", ""Yi Cui""]","Zheng, G., Lee, S., Liang, Z. et al.

article,Optical trapping of individual human immunodeficiency viruses in culture fluid reveals heterogeneity with single-molecule resolution,"<p>Optical tweezers use the momentum of photons to trap and manipulate microscopic objects, contact-free, in three dimensions. Although this technique has been widely used in biology and nanotechnology to study molecular motors, biopolymers and nanostructures, its application to study viruses has been very limited, largely due to their small size. Here, using optical tweezers that can simultaneously resolve two-photon fluorescence at the single-molecule level, we show that individual HIV-1 viruses can be optically trapped and manipulated, allowing multi-parameter analysis of single virions in culture fluid under native conditions. We show that individual HIV-1 differs in the numbers of envelope glycoproteins by more than one order of magnitude, which implies substantial heterogeneity of these virions in transmission and infection at the single-particle level. Analogous to flow cytometry for cells, this fluid-based technique may allow ultrasensitive detection, multi-parameter analysis and sorting of viruses and other nanoparticles in biological fluid with single-molecule resolution.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuanjie Pang"", ""Hanna Song"", ""Jin H.

article,Non-invasive multimodal functional imaging of the intestine with frozen micellar naphthalocyanines,"<p>There is a need for safer and improved methods for non-invasive imaging of the gastrointestinal tract. Modalities based on X-ray radiation, magnetic resonance and ultrasound suffer from limitations with respect to safety, accessibility or lack of adequate contrast. Functional intestinal imaging of dynamic gut processes has not been practical using existing approaches. Here, we report the development of a family of nanoparticles that can withstand the harsh conditions of the stomach and intestine, avoid systemic absorption, and provide good optical contrast for photoacoustic imaging. The hydrophobicity of naphthalocyanine dyes was exploited to generate purified &#8764;20&#8197;nm frozen micelles, which we call nanonaps, with tunable and large near-infrared absorption values (&gt;1,000). Unlike conventional chromophores, nanonaps exhibit non-shifting spectra at ultrahigh optical densities and, following oral administration in mice, passed safely through the gastrointestinal tract. Non-invasive, non-ionizing photoacoustic techniques were used to visualize nanonap intestinal distribution with low background and remarkable resolution, and enabled real-time intestinal functional imaging with ultrasound co-registration. Positron emission tomography following seamless nanonap radiolabelling allowed complementary whole-body imaging.</p>",[],False,"[""Yumiao Zhang"", ""Mansik Jeon"", ""Laurie J.

article,A carbon nanotube–polymer composite for T-cell therapy,"<p>Clinical translation of cell therapies requires strategies that can manufacture cells efficiently and economically. One promising way to reproducibly expand T cells for cancer therapy is by attaching the stimuli for T cells onto artificial substrates with high surface area. Here, we show that a carbon nanotube&#8211;polymer composite can act as an artificial antigen-presenting cell to efficiently expand the number of T cells isolated from mice. We attach antigens onto bundled carbon nanotubes and combined this complex with polymer nanoparticles containing magnetite and the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2). The number of T cells obtained was comparable to clinical standards using a thousand-fold less soluble IL-2. T cells obtained from this expansion were able to delay tumour growth in a murine model for melanoma.

article,In vivo endothelial siRNA delivery using polymeric nanoparticles with low molecular weight,"<p>Dysfunctional endothelium contributes to more diseases than any other tissue in the body. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can help in the study and treatment of endothelial cells in vivo by durably silencing multiple genes simultaneously, but efficient siRNA delivery has so far remained challenging. Here, we show that polymeric nanoparticles made of low-molecular-weight polyamines and lipids can deliver siRNA to endothelial cells with high efficiency, thereby facilitating the simultaneous silencing of multiple endothelial genes in vivo. Unlike lipid or lipid-like nanoparticles, this formulation does not significantly reduce gene expression in hepatocytes or immune cells even at the dosage necessary for endothelial gene silencing. These nanoparticles mediate the most durable non-liver silencing reported so far and facilitate the delivery of siRNAs that modify endothelial function in mouse models of vascular permeability, emphysema, primary tumour growth and metastasis.</p>",[],False,"[""James E.
