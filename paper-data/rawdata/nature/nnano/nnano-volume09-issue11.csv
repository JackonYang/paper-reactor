article,Optomechanical photon shuttling between photonic cavities,"<p>Mechanical motion of photonic devices driven by optical forces provides a profound means of coupling between optical fields. The current focus of these optomechanical effects has been on cavity optomechanics systems in which co-localized optical and mechanical modes interact strongly to enable wave mixing between photons and phonons, and backaction cooling of mechanical modes. Alternatively, extended mechanical modes can also induce strong non-local effects on propagating optical fields or multiple localized optical modes at distances. Here, we demonstrate a multicavity optomechanical device in which torsional optomechanical motion can shuttle photons between two photonic crystal nanocavities. The resonance frequencies of the two cavities, one on each side of this &#8216;photon see-saw&#8217;, are modulated antisymmetrically by the device's rotation. Pumping photons into one cavity excites optomechanical self-oscillation, which strongly modulates the inter-cavity coupling and shuttles photons to the other empty cavity during every oscillation cycle in a well-regulated fashion.</p>",[],False,"[""Huan Li"", ""Mo Li""]","Li, H., Li, M.

article,Bidimensional nano-optomechanics and topological backaction in a non-conservative radiation force field,"<p>Optomechanics, which explores the fundamental coupling between light and mechanical motion, has made important advances in manipulating macroscopic mechanical oscillators down to the quantum level. However, dynamical effects related to the vectorial nature of the optomechanical interaction remain to be investigated. Here we study a nanowire with subwavelength dimensions coupled strongly to a tightly focused beam of light, enabling an ultrasensitive readout of the nanoresonator dynamics. We determine experimentally the vectorial structure of the optomechanical interaction and demonstrate that a bidimensional dynamical backaction governs the nanowire dynamics. Moreover, the spatial topology of the optomechanical interaction is responsible for novel canonical signatures of strong coupling between mechanical modes, which leads to a topological instability that underlies the non-conservative nature of the optomechanical interaction. These results have a universal character and illustrate the increased sensitivity of nanomechanical devices towards spatially varying interactions, opening fundamental perspectives in nanomechanics, optomechanics, ultrasensitive scanning force microscopy and nano-optics.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Growth of CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids with controlled size for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells,"<p>Perovskite solar cells with submicrometre-thick CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> or CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3&#8211;</sub><sub>x</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub> active layers show a power conversion efficiency as high as 15%. However, compared to the best-performing device, the average efficiency was as low as 12%, with a large standard deviation (s.d.). Here, we report perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency exceeding 16% and best efficiency of 17%. This was enabled by the growth of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> cuboids with a controlled size via a two-step spin-coating procedure. Spin-coating of a solution of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I with different concentrations follows the spin-coating of PbI<sub>2</sub>, and the cuboid size of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> is found to strongly depend on the concentration of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I. Light-harvesting efficiency and charge-carrier extraction are significantly affected by the cuboid size. Under simulated one-sun illumination, average efficiencies of 16.4% (s.d.&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.35), 16.3% (s.d.&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.44) and 13.5% (s.d.&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.34) are obtained from solutions of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>I with concentrations of 0.038&#8197;M, 0.050&#8197;M and 0.063 M, respectively. By controlling the size of the cuboids of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> during their growth, we achieved the best efficiency of 17.01% with a photocurrent density of 21.64&#8197;mA&#8197;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup>, open-circuit photovoltage of 1.056&#8197;V and fill factor of 0.741.</p>",[],False,"[""Jeong-Hyeok Im"", ""In-Hyuk Jang"", ""Norman Pellet"", ""Michael Gr\u00e4tzel"", ""Nam-Gyu Park""]","Im, JH., Jang, IH., Pellet, N. et al.

article,Single-molecule nucleic acid interactions monitored on a label-free microcavity biosensor platform,"<p>Biosensing relies on the detection of molecules and their specific interactions. It is therefore highly desirable to develop transducers exhibiting ultimate detection limits. Microcavities are an exemplary candidate technology for demonstrating such a capability in the optical domain and in a label-free fashion. Additional sensitivity gains, achievable by exploiting plasmon resonances, promise biosensing down to the single-molecule level. Here, we introduce a biosensing platform using optical microcavity-based sensors that exhibits single-molecule sensitivity and is selective to specific single binding events. Whispering gallery modes in glass microspheres are used to leverage plasmonic enhancements in gold nanorods for the specific detection of nucleic acid hybridization, down to single 8-mer oligonucleotides. Detection of single intercalating small molecules confirms the observation of single-molecule hybridization. Matched and mismatched strands are discriminated by their interaction kinetics. Our platform allows us to monitor specific molecular interactions transiently, hence mitigating the need for high binding affinity and avoiding permanent binding of target molecules to the receptors. Sensor lifetime is therefore increased, allowing interaction kinetics to be statistically analysed.</p>",[],False,"[""Martin D. Baaske"", ""Matthew R.

article,Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy of single nanodiamonds,"<p>Nanoparticles have attracted enormous attention for biomedical applications as optical labels, drug-delivery vehicles and contrast agents in vivo. In the quest for superior photostability and biocompatibility, nanodiamonds are considered one of the best choices due to their unique structural, chemical, mechanical and optical properties. So far, mainly fluorescent nanodiamonds have been utilized for cell imaging. However, their use is limited by the efficiency and costs in reliably producing fluorescent defect centres with stable optical properties. Here, we show that single non-fluorescing nanodiamonds exhibit strong coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) at the sp<sup>3</sup> vibrational resonance of diamond. Using correlative light and electron microscopy, the relationship between CARS signal strength and nanodiamond size is quantified. The calibrated CARS signal in turn enables the analysis of the number and size of nanodiamonds internalized in living cells in situ, which opens the exciting prospect of following complex cellular trafficking pathways quantitatively.</p>",[],False,"[""Iestyn Pope"", ""Lukas Payne"", ""George Zoriniants"", ""Evan Thomas"", ""Oliver Williams"", ""Peter Watson"", ""Wolfgang Langbein"", ""Paola Borri""]","Pope, I., Payne, L., Zoriniants, G. et al.
