article,Long-range magnetic coupling between nanoscale organic–metal hybrids mediated by a nanoskyrmion lattice,"<p>The design of nanoscale organic&#8211;metal hybrids with tunable magnetic properties as well as the realization of controlled magnetic coupling between them open gateways for novel molecular spintronic devices. Progress in this direction requires a combination of a clever choice of organic and thin-film materials, advanced magnetic characterization techniques with a spatial resolution down to the atomic length scale, and a thorough understanding of magnetic properties based on first-principles calculations. Here, we make use of carbon-based systems of various nanoscale size, such as single coronene molecules and islands of graphene, deposited on a skyrmion lattice of a single atomic layer of iron on an iridium substrate, in order to tune the magnetic characteristics (for example, magnetic moments, magnetic anisotropies and coercive field strengths) of the organic&#8211;metal hybrids. Moreover, we demonstrate long-range magnetic coupling between individual organic&#8211;metal hybrids via the chiral magnetic skyrmion lattice, thereby offering viable routes towards spin information transmission between magnetically stable states in nanoscale dimensions.</p>",[],False,"[""Jens Brede"", ""Nicolae Atodiresei"", ""Vasile Caciuc"", ""Maciej Bazarnik"", ""Ali Al-Zubi"", ""Stefan Bl\u00fcgel"", ""Roland Wiesendanger""]","Brede, J., Atodiresei, N., Caciuc, V. et al.

article,Lateral epitaxial growth of two-dimensional layered semiconductor heterojunctions,"<p>Two-dimensional layered semiconductors such as MoS<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub> have attracted considerable interest in recent times. Exploring the full potential of these layered materials requires precise spatial modulation of their chemical composition and electronic properties to create well-defined heterostructures. Here, we report the growth of compositionally modulated MoS<sub>2</sub>&#8211;MoSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>&#8211;WSe<sub>2</sub> lateral heterostructures by in situ modulation of the vapour-phase reactants during growth of these two-dimensional crystals. Raman and photoluminescence mapping studies demonstrate that the resulting heterostructure nanosheets exhibit clear structural and optical modulation. Transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping studies reveal a single crystalline structure with opposite modulation of sulphur and selenium distributions across the heterostructure interface. Electrical transport studies demonstrate that the WSe<sub>2</sub>&#8211;WS<sub>2</sub> heterojunctions form lateral p&#8211;n diodes and photodiodes, and can be used to create complementary inverters with high voltage gain. Our study is an important advance in the development of layered semiconductor heterostructures, an essential step towards achieving functional electronics and optoelectronics.</p>",[],True,"[""Xidong Duan"", ""Chen Wang"", ""Jonathan C.

article,An all-in-one nanopore battery array,"<p>A single nanopore structure that embeds all components of an electrochemical storage device could bring about the ultimate miniaturization in energy storage. Self-alignment of electrodes within each nanopore may enable closer and more controlled spacing between electrodes than in state-of-art batteries. Such an &#8216;all-in-one&#8217; nanopore battery array would also present an alternative to interdigitated electrode structures that employ complex three-dimensional geometries with greater spatial heterogeneity. Here, we report a battery composed of an array of nanobatteries connected in parallel, each composed of an anode, a cathode and a liquid electrolyte confined within the nanopores of anodic aluminium oxide, as an all-in-one nanosize device. Each nanoelectrode includes an outer Ru nanotube current collector and an inner nanotube of V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> storage material, forming a symmetric full nanopore storage cell with anode and cathode separated by an electrolyte region. The V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is prelithiated at one end to serve as the anode, with pristine V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> at the other end serving as the cathode, forming a battery that is asymmetrically cycled between 0.2&#8197;V and 1.8&#8197;V. The capacity retention of this full cell (relative to 1&#8197;C values) is 95% at 5&#8197;C and 46% at 150&#8197;C, with a 1,000-cycle life. From a fundamental point of view, our all-in-one nanopore battery array unveils an electrochemical regime in which ion insertion and surface charge mechanisms for energy storage become indistinguishable, and offers a testbed for studying ion transport limits in dense nanostructured electrode arrays.</p>",[],False,"[""Chanyuan Liu"", ""Eleanor I.

article,Long-range charge transport in single G-quadruplex DNA molecules,"<p>DNA and DNA-based polymers are of interest in molecular electronics because of their versatile and programmable structures. However, transport measurements have produced a range of seemingly contradictory results due to differences in the measured molecules and experimental set-ups, and transporting significant current through individual DNA-based molecules remains a considerable challenge. Here, we report reproducible charge transport in guanine-quadruplex (G4) DNA molecules adsorbed on a mica substrate. Currents ranging from tens of picoamperes to more than 100&#8197;pA were measured in the G4-DNA over distances ranging from tens of nanometres to more than 100&#8197;nm. Our experimental results, combined with theoretical modelling, suggest that transport occurs via a thermally activated long-range hopping between multi-tetrad segments of DNA. These results could re-ignite interest in DNA-based wires and devices, and in the use of such systems in the development of programmable circuits.</p>",[],False,"[""Gideon I.

article,Detection of cancer biomarkers in serum using a hybrid mechanical and optoplasmonic nanosensor,"<p>Blood contains a range of protein biomarkers that could be used in the early detection of disease. To achieve this, however, requires sensors capable of detecting (with high reproducibility) biomarkers at concentrations one million times lower than the concentration of the other blood proteins. Here, we show that a sandwich assay that combines mechanical and optoplasmonic transduction can detect cancer biomarkers in serum at ultralow concentrations. A biomarker is first recognized by a surface-anchored antibody and then by an antibody in solution that identifies a free region of the captured biomarker. This second antibody is tethered to a gold nanoparticle that acts as a mass and plasmonic label; the two signatures are detected by means of a silicon cantilever that serves as a mechanical resonator for &#8216;weighing&#8217; the mass of the captured nanoparticles and as an optical cavity that boosts the plasmonic signal from the nanoparticles. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated with two cancer biomarkers: the carcinoembryonic antigen and the prostate specific antigen, which are currently in clinical use for the diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of colon and prostate cancer, respectively. A detection limit of 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup> g ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in serum is achieved with both biomarkers, which is at least seven orders of magnitude lower than that achieved in routine clinical practice.

article,Squalenoyl adenosine nanoparticles provide neuroprotection after stroke and spinal cord injury,"<p>There is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of severe neurological trauma, such as stroke and spinal cord injuries. However, many drugs with potential neuropharmacological activity, such as adenosine, are inefficient upon systemic administration because of their fast metabolization and rapid clearance from the bloodstream. Here, we show that conjugation of adenosine to the lipid squalene and the subsequent formation of nanoassemblies allows prolonged circulation of this nucleoside, providing neuroprotection in mouse stroke and rat spinal cord injury models. The animals receiving systemic administration of squalenoyl adenosine nanoassemblies showed a significant improvement of their neurologic deficit score in the case of cerebral ischaemia, and an early motor recovery of the hindlimbs in the case of spinal cord injury. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the nanoassemblies were able to extend adenosine circulation and its interaction with the neurovascular unit. This Article shows, for the first time, that a hydrophilic and rapidly metabolized molecule such as adenosine may become pharmacologically efficient owing to a single conjugation with the lipid squalene.</p>",[],False,"[""Alice Gaudin"", ""M\u00fcge Yemisci"", ""Hakan Eroglu"", ""Sinda Lepetre-Mouelhi"", ""Omer Faruk Turkoglu"", ""Buket D\u00f6nmez-Demir"", ""Se\u00e7il Caban"", ""Mustafa Fevzi Sargon"", ""S\u00e9bastien Garcia-Argote"", ""Gr\u00e9gory Pieters"", ""Olivier Loreau"", ""Bernard Rousseau"", ""Oya Tagit"", ""Niko Hildebrandt"", ""Yannick Le Dantec"", ""Julie Mougin"", ""Sabrina Valetti"", ""H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Chacun"", ""Val\u00e9rie Nicolas"", ""Didier Desma\u00eble"", ""Karine Andrieux"", ""Yilmaz Capan"", ""Turgay Dalkara"", ""Patrick Couvreur""]","Gaudin, A., Yemisci, M., Eroglu, H. et al.
