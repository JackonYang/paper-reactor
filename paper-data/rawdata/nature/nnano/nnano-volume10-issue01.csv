article,Light-powered autonomous and directional molecular motion of a dissipative self-assembling system,"<p>Biomolecular motors convert energy into directed motion and operate away from thermal equilibrium. The development of dynamic chemical systems that exploit dissipative (non-equilibrium) processes is a challenge in supramolecular chemistry and a premise for the realization of artificial nanoscale motors. Here, we report the relative unidirectional transit of a non-symmetric molecular axle through a macrocycle powered solely by light. The molecular machine rectifies Brownian fluctuations by energy and information ratchet mechanisms and can repeat its working cycle under photostationary conditions. The system epitomizes the conceptual and practical elements forming the basis of autonomous light-powered directed motion with a minimalist molecular design.</p>",[],False,"[""Giulio Ragazzon"", ""Massimo Baroncini"", ""Serena Silvi"", ""Margherita Venturi"", ""Alberto Credi""]","Ragazzon, G., Baroncini, M., Silvi, S. et al.

article,Continuous observation of the stochastic motion of an individual small-molecule walker,"<p>Motion&#8212;whether it the ability to change shape, rotate or translate&#8212;is an important potential asset for functional nanostructures. For translational motion, a variety of DNA-based and small-molecule walkers have been created, but observing the translational motion of individual molecules in real time remains a significant challenge. Here, we show that the movement of a small-molecule walker along a five-foothold track can be monitored continuously within a protein nanoreactor. The walker is an organoarsenic(III) molecule with exchangeable thiol ligands, and the track a line of cysteine residues 6&#8197;&#197; apart within an &#945;-haemolysin protein pore that acts as the nanoreactor. Changes in the flow of ionic current through the pore reflect the individual steps of a single walker, which require the making and breaking of As&#8211;S bonds, and occur in aqueous solution at neutral pH and room temperature. The walker moves considerably faster (&#8764;0.7&#8197;s per step) than previous walkers based on covalent chemistry and is weakly processive (6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1 steps per outing). It shows weak net directional movement, which can be described by a thermodynamic sink arising from the different environments of the cysteines that constitute the track.</p>",[],False,"[""G\u00f6k\u00e7e Su Pulcu"", ""Ellina Mikhailova"", ""Lai-Sheung Choi"", ""Hagan Bayley""]","Pulcu, G., Mikhailova, E., Choi, LS. et al.

article,A silicon-based photocathode for water reduction with an epitaxial SrTiO3 protection layer and a nanostructured catalyst,"<p>The rapidly increasing global demand for energy combined with the environmental impact of fossil fuels has spurred the search for alternative sources of clean energy. One promising approach is to convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel using photoelectrochemical cells. However, the semiconducting photoelectrodes used in these cells typically have low efficiencies and/or stabilities. Here we show that a silicon-based photocathode with a capping epitaxial oxide layer can provide efficient and stable hydrogen production from water. In particular, a thin epitaxial layer of strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) was grown directly on Si(001) by molecular beam epitaxy. Photogenerated electrons can be transported easily through this layer because of the conduction-band alignment and lattice match between single-crystalline SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and silicon. The approach was used to create a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor photocathode that, under a broad-spectrum illumination at 100&#8197;mW cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, exhibits a maximum photocurrent density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and an open circuit potential of 450&#8197;mV; there was no observable decrease in performance after 35 hours of operation in 0.5&#8201;M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The performance of the photocathode was also found to be highly dependent on the size and spacing of the structured metal catalyst. Therefore, mesh-like Ti/Pt nanostructured catalysts were created using a nanosphere lithography lift-off process and an applied-bias photon-to-current efficiency of 4.9% was achieved.</p>",[],False,"[""Li Ji"", ""Martin D.

article,Towards non-invasive diagnostic imaging of early-stage Alzheimer's disease,"<p>One way to image the molecular pathology in Alzheimer's disease is by positron emission tomography using probes that target amyloid fibrils. However, these fibrils are not closely linked to the development of the disease. It is now thought that early-stage biomarkers that instigate memory loss are composed of A&#946; oligomers. Here, we report a sensitive molecular magnetic resonance imaging contrast probe that is specific for A&#946; oligomers. We attach oligomer-specific antibodies onto magnetic nanostructures and show that the complex is stable and binds to A&#946; oligomers on cells and brain tissues to give a magnetic resonance imaging signal. When intranasally administered to an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, the probe readily reached hippocampal A&#946; oligomers. In isolated samples of human brain tissue, we observed a magnetic resonance imaging signal that distinguished Alzheimer's disease from controls. Such nanostructures that target neurotoxic A&#946; oligomers are potentially useful for evaluating the efficacy of new drugs and ultimately for early-stage Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and disease management.</p>",[],False,"[""Kirsten L.
