article,Spin–orbit-torque engineering via oxygen manipulation,"<p>Spin transfer torques allow the electrical manipulation of magnetization at room temperature, which is desirable in spintronic devices such as spin transfer torque memories. When combined with spin&#8211;orbit coupling, they give rise to spin&#8211;orbit torques, which are a more powerful tool for controlling magnetization and can enrich device functionalities. The engineering of spin&#8211;orbit torques, based mostly on the spin Hall effect, is being intensely pursued. Here, we report that the oxidation of spin&#8211;orbit-torque devices triggers a new mechanism of spin&#8211;orbit torque, which is about two times stronger than that based on the spin Hall effect. We thus introduce a way to engineer spin&#8211;orbit torques via oxygen manipulation.

article,Inertial imaging with nanomechanical systems,"<p>Mass sensing with nanoelectromechanical systems has advanced significantly during the last decade. With nanoelectromechanical systems sensors it is now possible to carry out ultrasensitive detection of gaseous analytes, to achieve atomic-scale mass resolution and to perform mass spectrometry on single proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution of mass within an individual analyte can be imaged&#8212;in real time and at the molecular scale&#8212;when it adsorbs onto a nanomechanical resonator. Each single-molecule adsorption event induces discrete, time-correlated perturbations to all modal frequencies of the device. We show that by continuously monitoring a multiplicity of vibrational modes, the spatial moments of mass distribution can be deduced for individual analytes, one-by-one, as they adsorb. We validate this method for inertial imaging, using both experimental measurements of multimode frequency shifts and numerical simulations, to analyse the inertial mass, position of adsorption and the size and shape of individual analytes. Unlike conventional imaging, the minimum analyte size detectable through nanomechanical inertial imaging is not limited by wavelength-dependent diffraction phenomena. Instead, frequency fluctuation processes determine the ultimate attainable resolution. Advanced nanoelectromechanical devices appear capable of resolving molecular-scale analytes.</p>",[],False,"[""M. Selim Hanay"", ""Scott I. Kelber"", ""Cathal D.

article,Plateau–Rayleigh crystal growth of periodic shells on one-dimensional substrates,"<p>The Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability was first proposed in the mid-1800s to describe how a column of water breaks apart into droplets to lower its surface tension. This instability was later generalized to account for the constant volume rearrangement of various one-dimensional liquid and solid materials. Here, we report a growth phenomenon that is unique to one-dimensional materials and exploits the underlying physics of the Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability. We term the phenomenon Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh crystal growth and demonstrate that it can be used to grow periodic shells on one-dimensional substrates. Specifically, we show that for certain conditions, depositing Si onto uniform-diameter Si cores, Ge onto Ge cores and Ge onto Si cores can generate diameter-modulated core&#8211;shell nanowires. Rational control of deposition conditions enables tuning of distinct morphological features, including diameter-modulation periodicity and amplitude and cross-sectional anisotropy. Our results suggest that surface energy reductions drive the formation of periodic shells, and that variation in kinetic terms and crystal facet energetics provide the means for tunability.</p>",[],False,"[""Robert W.

article,Light-emitting self-assembled peptide nucleic acids exhibit both stacking interactions and Watson–Crick base pairing,"<p>The two main branches of bionanotechnology involve the self-assembly of either peptides or DNA. Peptide scaffolds offer chemical versatility, architectural flexibility and structural complexity, but they lack the precise base pairing and molecular recognition available with nucleic acid assemblies. Here, inspired by the ability of aromatic dipeptides to form ordered nanostructures with unique physical properties, we explore the assembly of peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), which are short DNA mimics that have an amide backbone. All 16 combinations of the very short di-PNA building blocks were synthesized and assayed for their ability to self-associate. Only three guanine-containing di-PNAs&#8212;CG, GC and GG&#8212;could form ordered assemblies, as observed by electron microscopy, and these di-PNAs efficiently assembled into discrete architectures within a few minutes. The X-ray crystal structure of the GC di-PNA showed the occurrence of both stacking interactions and Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. The assemblies were also found to exhibit optical properties including voltage-dependent electroluminescence and wide-range excitation-dependent fluorescence in the visible region.</p>",[],False,"[""Or Berger"", ""Lihi Adler-Abramovich"", ""Michal Levy-Sakin"", ""Assaf Grunwald"", ""Yael Liebes-Peer"", ""Mor Bachar"", ""Ludmila Buzhansky"", ""Estelle Mossou"", ""V.

article,An endogenous nanomineral chaperones luminal antigen and peptidoglycan to intestinal immune cells,"<p>In humans and other mammals it is known that calcium and phosphate ions are secreted from the distal small intestine into the lumen. However, why this secretion occurs is unclear. Here, we show that the process leads to the formation of amorphous magnesium-substituted calcium phosphate nanoparticles that trap soluble macromolecules, such as bacterial peptidoglycan and orally fed protein antigens, in the lumen and transport them to immune cells of the intestinal tissue. The macromolecule-containing nanoparticles utilize epithelial M cells to enter Peyer's patches, small areas of the intestine concentrated with particle-scavenging immune cells. In wild-type mice, intestinal immune cells containing these naturally formed nanoparticles expressed the immune tolerance-associated molecule &#8216;programmed death-ligand 1&#8217;, whereas in NOD1/2 double knockout mice, which cannot recognize peptidoglycan, programmed death-ligand 1 was undetected. Our results explain a role for constitutively formed calcium phosphate nanoparticles in the gut lumen and show how this helps to shape intestinal immune homeostasis.</p>",[],False,"[""Jonathan J.

article,Breaking the depth dependency of phototherapy with Cerenkov radiation and low-radiance-responsive nanophotosensitizers,"<p>The combination of light and photosensitizers for phototherapeutic interventions, such as photodynamic therapy, has transformed medicine and biology. However, the shallow penetration of light into tissues and the reliance on tissue oxygenation to generate cytotoxic radicals have limited the method to superficial or endoscope-accessible lesions. Here we report a way to overcome these limitations by using Cerenkov radiation from radionuclides to activate an oxygen-independent nanophotosensitizer, titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). We show that the administration of transferrin-coated TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and clinically used radionuclides in mice and colocalization in tumours results in either complete tumour remission or an increase in their median survival. Histological analysis of tumour sections showed the selective destruction of cancerous cells and high numbers of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, which suggests that both free radicals and the activation of the immune system mediated the destruction. Our results offer a way to harness low-radiance-sensitive nanophotosensitizers to achieve depth-independent Cerenkov-radiation-mediated therapy.</p>",[],False,"[""Nalinikanth Kotagiri"", ""Gail P.
