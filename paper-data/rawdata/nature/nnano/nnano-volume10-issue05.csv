article,Nanoscale optical tomography with cathodoluminescence spectroscopy,"<p>Tomography has enabled the characterization of the Earth's interior, visualization of the inner workings of the human brain, and three-dimensional reconstruction of matter at the atomic scale. However, tomographic techniques that rely on optical excitation or detection are generally limited in their resolution by diffraction. Here, we introduce a tomographic technique&#8212;cathodoluminescence spectroscopic tomography&#8212;to probe optical properties in three dimensions with nanometre-scale spatial and spectral resolution. We first obtain two-dimensional cathodoluminescence maps of a three-dimensional nanostructure at various orientations. We then use the method of filtered back-projection to reconstruct the cathodoluminescence intensity at each wavelength. The resulting tomograms allow us to locate regions of efficient cathodoluminescence in three dimensions across visible and near-infrared wavelengths, with contributions from material luminescence and radiative decay of electromagnetic eigenmodes. The experimental signal can be further correlated with the radiative local density of optical states in particular regions of the reconstruction. We demonstrate how cathodoluminescence tomography can be used to achieve nanoscale three-dimensional visualization of light&#8211;matter interactions by reconstructing a three-dimensional metal&#8211;dielectric nanoresonator.</p>",[],False,"[""Ashwin C.

article,Generation of photovoltage in graphene on a femtosecond timescale through efficient carrier heating,"<p>Graphene is a promising material for ultrafast and broadband photodetection. Earlier studies have addressed the general operation of graphene-based photothermoelectric devices and the switching speed, which is limited by the charge carrier cooling time, on the order of picoseconds. However, the generation of the photovoltage could occur at a much faster timescale, as it is associated with the carrier heating time. Here, we measure the photovoltage generation time and find it to be faster than 50&#8197;fs. As a proof-of-principle application of this ultrafast photodetector, we use graphene to directly measure, electrically, the pulse duration of a sub-50&#8197;fs laser pulse. The observation that carrier heating is ultrafast suggests that energy from absorbed photons can be efficiently transferred to carrier heat. To study this, we examine the spectral response and find a constant spectral responsivity of between 500 and 1,500&#8197;nm. This is consistent with efficient electron heating. These results are promising for ultrafast femtosecond and broadband photodetector applications.</p>",[],False,"[""K. J. Tielrooij"", ""L. Piatkowski"", ""M. Massicotte"", ""A. Woessner"", ""Q.

article,A metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions,"<p>The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are traditionally carried out with noble metals (such as Pt) and metal oxides (such as RuO<sub>2</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub>) as catalysts, respectively. However, these metal-based catalysts often suffer from multiple disadvantages, including high cost, low selectivity, poor stability and detrimental environmental effects. Here, we describe a mesoporous carbon foam co-doped with nitrogen and phosphorus that has a large surface area of &#8764;1,663&#8197;m<sup>2</sup>&#8197;g<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and good electrocatalytic properties for both ORR and OER. This material was fabricated using a scalable, one-step process involving the pyrolysis of a polyaniline aerogel synthesized in the presence of phytic acid. We then tested the suitability of this N,P-doped carbon foam as an air electrode for primary and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Primary batteries demonstrated an open-circuit potential of 1.48&#8197;V, a specific capacity of 735&#8197;mAh&#8197;g<sub>Zn</sub><sup>&#8722;1</sup> (corresponding to an energy density of 835&#8197;Wh&#8197;kg<sub>Zn</sub><sup>&#8722;1</sup>), a peak power density of 55&#8197;mW&#8197;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, and stable operation for 240&#8197;h after mechanical recharging. Two-electrode rechargeable batteries could be cycled stably for 180 cycles at 2&#8197;mA&#8197;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. We also examine the activity of our carbon foam for both OER and ORR independently, in a three-electrode configuration, and discuss ways in which the Zn&#8211;air battery can be further improved. Finally, our density functional theory calculations reveal that the N,P co-doping and graphene edge effects are essential for the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of our material.</p>",[],False,"[""Jintao Zhang"", ""Zhenghang Zhao"", ""Zhenhai Xia"", ""Liming Dai""]","Zhang, J., Zhao, Z., Xia, Z. et al.A metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions.

article,Nanoscale form dictates mesoscale function in plasmonic DNA–nanoparticle superlattices,"<p>The nanoscale manipulation of matter allows properties to be created in a material that would be difficult or even impossible to achieve in the bulk state. Progress towards such functional nanoscale architectures requires the development of methods to precisely locate nanoscale objects in three dimensions and for the formation of rigorous structure&#8211;function relationships across multiple size regimes (beginning from the nanoscale). Here, we use DNA as a programmable ligand to show that two- and three-dimensional mesoscale superlattice crystals with precisely engineered optical properties can be assembled from the bottom up. The superlattices can transition from exhibiting the properties of the constituent plasmonic nanoparticles to adopting the photonic properties defined by the mesoscale crystal (here a rhombic dodecahedron) by controlling the spacing between the gold nanoparticle building blocks. Furthermore, we develop a generally applicable theoretical framework that illustrates how crystal habit can be a design consideration for controlling far-field extinction and light confinement in plasmonic metamaterial superlattices.</p>",[],False,"[""Michael B.

article,Water desalination using nanoporous single-layer graphene,"<p>By creating nanoscale pores in a layer of graphene, it could be used as an effective separation membrane due to its chemical and mechanical stability, its flexibility and, most importantly, its one-atom thickness. Theoretical studies have indicated that the performance of such membranes should be superior to state-of-the-art polymer-based filtration membranes, and experimental studies have recently begun to explore their potential. Here, we show that single-layer porous graphene can be used as a desalination membrane. Nanometre-sized pores are created in a graphene monolayer using an oxygen plasma etching process, which allows the size of the pores to be tuned. The resulting membranes exhibit a salt rejection rate of nearly 100% and rapid water transport.

article,Carbon nanotube-assisted optical activation of TGF-β signalling by near-infrared light,"<p>Receptor-mediated signal transduction modulates complex cellular behaviours such as cell growth, migration and differentiation. Although photoactivatable proteins have emerged as a powerful tool for controlling molecular interactions and signalling cascades at precise times and spaces using light, many of these light-sensitive proteins are activated by ultraviolent or visible light, which has limited tissue penetration. Here, we report a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-assisted approach that enables near-infrared light-triggered activation of transforming growth factor &#946; (TGF-&#946;) signal transduction, an important signalling pathway in embryonic development and cancer progression. The protein complex of TGF-&#946; and its latency-associated peptide is conjugated onto SWCNTs, where TGF-&#946; is inactive. Upon near-infrared irradiation, TGF-&#946; is released through the photothermal effect of SWCNTs and becomes active. The released TGF-&#946; activates downstream signal transduction in live cells and modulates cellular behaviours. Furthermore, preliminary studies show that the method can be used to mediate TGF-&#946; signalling in living mice.</p>",[],False,"[""Liang Lin"", ""Ling Liu"", ""Bing Zhao"", ""Ran Xie"", ""Wei Lin"", ""He Li"", ""Yaya Li"", ""Minlong Shi"", ""Ye-Guang Chen"", ""Timothy A.

article,Mapping protein binding sites on the biomolecular corona of nanoparticles,"<p>Nanoparticles in a biological milieu are known to form a sufficiently long-lived and well-organized &#8216;corona&#8217; of biomolecules to confer a biological identity to the particle. Because this nanoparticle&#8211;biomolecule complex interacts with cells and biological barriers, potentially engaging with different biological pathways, it is important to clarify the presentation of functional biomolecular motifs at its interface. Here, we demonstrate that by using antibody-labelled gold nanoparticles, differential centrifugal sedimentation and various imaging techniques it is possible to identify the spatial location of proteins, their functional motifs and their binding sites. We show that for transferrin-coated polystyrene nanoparticles only a minority of adsorbed proteins exhibit functional motifs and the spatial organization appears random, which is consistent, overall, with a stochastic and irreversible adsorption process. Our methods are applicable to a wide array of nanoparticles and can offer a microscopic molecular description of the biological identity of nanoparticles.</p>",[],False,"[""Philip M.
