article,Multi-terminal transport measurements of MoS2 using a van der Waals heterostructure device platform,"<p>Atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors such as MoS<sub>2</sub> hold great promise for electrical, optical and mechanical devices and display novel physical phenomena. However, the electron mobility of mono- and few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> has so far been substantially below theoretically predicted limits, which has hampered efforts to observe its intrinsic quantum transport behaviours. Potential sources of disorder and scattering include defects such as sulphur vacancies in the MoS<sub>2</sub> itself as well as extrinsic sources such as charged impurities and remote optical phonons from oxide dielectrics. To reduce extrinsic scattering, we have developed here a van der Waals heterostructure device platform where MoS<sub>2</sub> layers are fully encapsulated within hexagonal boron nitride and electrically contacted in a multi-terminal geometry using gate-tunable graphene electrodes. Magneto-transport measurements show dramatic improvements in performance, including a record-high Hall mobility reaching 34,000&#8197;cm<sup>2</sup>&#8197;V<sup>&#8211;1</sup>&#8197;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup> for six-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> at low temperature, confirming that low-temperature performance in previous studies was limited by extrinsic interfacial impurities rather than bulk defects in the MoS<sub>2</sub>. We also observed Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations in high-mobility monolayer and few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub>. Modelling of potential scattering sources and quantum lifetime analysis indicate that a combination of short-range and long-range interfacial scattering limits the low-temperature mobility of MoS<sub>2</sub>.</p>",[],False,"[""Xu Cui"", ""Gwan-Hyoung Lee"", ""Young Duck Kim"", ""Ghidewon Arefe"", ""Pinshane Y.

article,High-efficiency resonant amplification of weak magnetic fields for single spin magnetometry at room temperature,"<p>Magnetic resonance techniques not only provide powerful imaging tools that have revolutionized medicine, but they have a wide spectrum of applications in other fields of science such as biology, chemistry, neuroscience and physics. However, current state-of-the-art magnetometers are unable to detect a single nuclear spin unless the tip-to-sample separation is made sufficiently small. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that by placing a ferromagnetic particle between a nitrogen&#8211;vacancy magnetometer and a target spin, the magnetometer sensitivity is improved dramatically. Using materials and techniques that are already experimentally available, our proposed set-up is sensitive enough to detect a single nuclear spin within ten milliseconds of data acquisition at room temperature. The sensitivity is practically unchanged when the ferromagnet surface to the target spin separation is smaller than the ferromagnet lateral dimensions; typically about a tenth of a micrometre. This scheme further benefits when used for nitrogen&#8211;vacancy ensemble measurements, enhancing sensitivity by an additional three orders of magnitude.</p>",[],False,"[""Luka Trifunovic"", ""Fabio L.

article,An artificial molecular pump,"<p>Carrier proteins consume fuel in order to pump ions or molecules across cell membranes, creating concentration gradients. Their control over diffusion pathways, effected entirely through noncovalent bonding interactions, has inspired chemists to devise artificial systems that mimic their function. Here, we report a wholly artificial compound that acts on small molecules to create a gradient in their local concentration. It does so by using redox energy and precisely organized noncovalent bonding interactions to pump positively charged rings from solution and ensnare them around an oligomethylene chain, as part of a kinetically trapped entanglement. A redox-active viologen unit at the heart of a dumbbell-shaped molecular pump plays a dual role, first attracting and then repelling the rings during redox cycling, thereby enacting a flashing energy ratchet mechanism with a minimalistic design. Our artificial molecular pump performs work repetitively for two cycles of operation and drives rings away from equilibrium toward a higher local concentration.</p>",[],False,"[""Chuyang Cheng"", ""Paul R.

article,Vertical nanopillars for in situ probing of nuclear mechanics in adherent cells,"<p>The mechanical stability and deformability of the cell nucleus are crucial to many biological processes, including migration, proliferation and polarization. In vivo, the cell nucleus is frequently subjected to deformation on a variety of length and time scales, but current techniques for studying nuclear mechanics do not provide access to subnuclear deformation in live functioning cells. Here we introduce arrays of vertical nanopillars as a new method for the in situ study of nuclear deformability and the mechanical coupling between the cell membrane and the nucleus in live cells. Our measurements show that nanopillar-induced nuclear deformation is determined by nuclear stiffness, as well as opposing effects from actin and intermediate filaments. Furthermore, the depth, width and curvature of nuclear deformation can be controlled by varying the geometry of the nanopillar array. Overall, vertical nanopillar arrays constitute a novel approach for non-invasive, subcellular perturbation of nuclear mechanics and mechanotransduction in live cells.</p>",[],False,"[""Lindsey Hanson"", ""Wenting Zhao"", ""Hsin-Ya Lou"", ""Ziliang Carter Lin"", ""Seok Woo Lee"", ""Praveen Chowdary"", ""Yi Cui"", ""Bianxiao Cui""]","Hanson, L., Zhao, W., Lou, HY. et al.
