article,Black silicon solar cells with interdigitated back-contacts achieve 22.1% efficiency,"<p>The nanostructuring of silicon surfaces&#8212;known as black silicon&#8212;is a promising approach to eliminate front-surface reflection in photovoltaic devices without the need for a conventional antireflection coating. This might lead to both an increase in efficiency and a reduction in the manufacturing costs of solar cells. However, all previous attempts to integrate black silicon into solar cells have resulted in cell efficiencies well below 20% due to the increased charge carrier recombination at the nanostructured surface. Here, we show that a conformal alumina film can solve the issue of surface recombination in black silicon solar cells by providing excellent chemical and electrical passivation. We demonstrate that efficiencies above 22% can be reached, even in thick interdigitated back-contacted cells, where carrier transport is very sensitive to front surface passivation. This means that the surface recombination issue has truly been solved and black silicon solar cells have real potential for industrial production. Furthermore, we show that the use of black silicon can result in a 3% increase in daily energy production when compared with a reference cell with the same efficiency, due to its better angular acceptance.</p>",[],False,"[""Hele Savin"", ""P\u00e4ivikki Repo"", ""Guillaume von Gastrow"", ""Pablo Ortega"", ""Eric Calle"", ""Moises Gar\u00edn"", ""Ramon Alcubilla""]","Savin, H., Repo, P., von Gastrow, G. et al.

article,Syringe-injectable electronics,"<p>Seamless and minimally invasive three-dimensional interpenetration of electronics within artificial or natural structures could allow for continuous monitoring and manipulation of their properties. Flexible electronics provide a means for conforming electronics to non-planar surfaces, yet targeted delivery of flexible electronics to internal regions remains difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by demonstrating the syringe injection (and subsequent unfolding) of sub-micrometre-thick, centimetre-scale macroporous mesh electronics through needles with a diameter as small as 100&#8197;&#956;m. Our results show that electronic components can be injected into man-made and biological cavities, as well as dense gels and tissue, with &gt;90% device yield. We demonstrate several applications of syringe-injectable electronics as a general approach for interpenetrating flexible electronics with three-dimensional structures, including (1) monitoring internal mechanical strains in polymer cavities, (2) tight integration and low chronic immunoreactivity with several distinct regions of the brain, and (3) in vivo multiplexed neural recording. Moreover, syringe injection enables the delivery of flexible electronics through a rigid shell, the delivery of large-volume flexible electronics that can fill internal cavities, and co-injection of electronics with other materials into host structures, opening up unique applications for flexible electronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Jia Liu"", ""Tian-Ming Fu"", ""Zengguang Cheng"", ""Guosong Hong"", ""Tao Zhou"", ""Lihua Jin"", ""Madhavi Duvvuri"", ""Zhe Jiang"", ""Peter Kruskal"", ""Chong Xie"", ""Zhigang Suo"", ""Ying Fang"", ""Charles M.

article,Prescribed nanoparticle cluster architectures and low-dimensional arrays built using octahedral DNA origami frames,"<p>Three-dimensional mesoscale clusters that are formed from nanoparticles spatially arranged in pre-determined positions can be thought of as mesoscale analogues of molecules. These nanoparticle architectures could offer tailored properties due to collective effects, but developing a general platform for fabricating such clusters is a significant challenge. Here, we report a strategy for assembling three-dimensional nanoparticle clusters that uses a molecular frame designed with encoded vertices for particle placement. The frame is a DNA origami octahedron and can be used to fabricate clusters with various symmetries and particle compositions. Cryo-electron microscopy is used to uncover the structure of the DNA frame and to reveal that the nanoparticles are spatially coordinated in the prescribed manner. We show that the DNA frame and one set of nanoparticles can be used to create nanoclusters with different chiroptical activities. We also show that the octahedra can serve as programmable interparticle linkers, allowing one- and two-dimensional arrays to be assembled with designed particle arrangements.</p>",[],False,"[""Ye Tian"", ""Tong Wang"", ""Wenyan Liu"", ""Huolin L.

article,A pH-independent DNA nanodevice for quantifying chloride transport in organelles of living cells,"<p>The concentration of chloride ions in the cytoplasm and subcellular organelles of living cells spans a wide range (5&#8211;130&#8197;mM), and is tightly regulated by intracellular chloride channels or transporters. Chloride-sensitive protein reporters have been used to study the role of these chloride regulators, but they are limited to a small range of chloride concentrations and are pH-sensitive. Here, we show that a DNA nanodevice can precisely measure the activity and location of subcellular chloride channels and transporters in living cells in a pH-independent manner. The DNA nanodevice, called Clensor, is composed of sensing, normalizing and targeting modules, and is designed to localize within organelles along the endolysosomal pathway. It allows fluorescent, ratiometric sensing of chloride ions across the entire physiological regime. We used Clensor to quantitate the resting chloride concentration in the lumen of acidic organelles in Drosophila melanogaster. We showed that lumenal lysosomal chloride, which is implicated in various lysosomal storage diseases, is regulated by the intracellular chloride transporter DmClC-b.</p>",[],False,"[""Sonali Saha"", ""Ved Prakash"", ""Saheli Halder"", ""Kasturi Chakraborty"", ""Yamuna Krishnan""]","Saha, S., Prakash, V., Halder, S. et al.A pH-independent DNA nanodevice for quantifying chloride transport in organelles of living cells.
