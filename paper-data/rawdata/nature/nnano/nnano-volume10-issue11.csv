article,Tuning emergent magnetism in a Hund's impurity,"<p>The recently proposed concept of a Hund's metal&#8212;a metal in which electron correlations are driven by Hund's rule coupling&#8212;can be used to explain the exotic magnetic and electronic behaviour of strongly correlated electron systems of multi-orbital metallic materials. Tuning the abundance of parameters that determine these materials is, however, experimentally challenging. Here, we show that the basic constituent of a Hund's metal&#8212;a Hund's impurity&#8212;can be realized using a single iron atom adsorbed on a platinum surface, a system that comprises a magnetic moment in the presence of strong charge fluctuations. The magnetic properties can be controlled by using the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope to change the binding site and degree of hydrogenation of the 3d transition-metal atom. We are able to experimentally explore a regime of four almost degenerate energy scales (Zeeman energy, temperature, Kondo temperature and magnetic anisotropy) and probe the magnetic excitations with the microscope tip. The regime of our Hund's impurity can be tuned from an emergent magnetic moment to a multi-orbital Kondo state, and the system could be used to test predictions of advanced many-body theories for non-Fermi liquids in quantum magnets or unconventional superconductors.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Quantum Hall resistance standard in graphene devices under relaxed experimental conditions,"<p>The quantum Hall effect provides a universal standard for electrical resistance that is theoretically based on only the Planck constant h and the electron charge e. Currently, this standard is implemented in GaAs/AlGaAs, but graphene's electronic properties have given hope for a more practical device. Here, we demonstrate that the experimental conditions necessary for the operation of devices made of high-quality graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition on silicon carbide can be extended and significantly relaxed compared with those for state-of-the-art GaAs/AlGaAs devices. In particular, the Hall resistance can be accurately quantized to within 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> over a 10&#8197;T wide range of magnetic flux density, down to 3.5&#8197;T, at a temperature of up to 10&#8197;K or with a current of up to 0.5&#8197;mA. This experimental simplification highlights the great potential of graphene in the development of user-friendly and versatile quantum standards that are compatible with broader industrial uses beyond those in national metrology institutes. Furthermore, the measured agreement of the quantized Hall resistance in graphene and GaAs/AlGaAs, with an ultimate uncertainty of 8.2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;11</sup>, supports the universality of the quantum Hall effect. This also provides evidence of the relation of the quantized Hall resistance with h and e, which is crucial for the new Syst&#232;me International d'unit&#233;s to be based on fixing such fundamental constants of nature.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

article,Enhancement of the anisotropic photocurrent in ferroelectric oxides by strain gradients,"<p>The phase separation of multiple competing structural/ferroelectric phases has attracted particular attention owing to its excellent electromechanical properties. Little is known, however, about the strain-gradient-induced electronic phenomena at the interface of competing structural phases. Here, we investigate the polymorphic phase interface of bismuth ferrites using spatially resolved photocurrent measurements, present the observation of a large enhancement of the anisotropic interfacial photocurrent by two orders of magnitude, and discuss the possible mechanism on the basis of the flexoelectric effect. Nanoscale characterizations of the photosensitive area through position-sensitive angle-resolved piezoresponse force microscopy and electron holography techniques, in conjunction with phase field simulation, reveal that regularly ordered dipole-charged domain walls emerge. These findings offer practical implications for complex oxide optoelectronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Kanghyun Chu"", ""Byung-Kweon Jang"", ""Ji Ho Sung"", ""Yoon Ah Shin"", ""Eui-Sup Lee"", ""Kyung Song"", ""Jin Hong Lee"", ""Chang-Su Woo"", ""Seung Jin Kim"", ""Si-Young Choi"", ""Tae Yeong Koo"", ""Yong-Hyun Kim"", ""Sang-Ho Oh"", ""Moon-Ho Jo"", ""Chan-Ho Yang""]","Chu, K., Jang, BK., Sung, J. et al.

article,A phosphorene–graphene hybrid material as a high-capacity anode for sodium-ion batteries,"<p>Sodium-ion batteries have recently attracted significant attention as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries because sodium sources do not present the geopolitical issues that lithium sources might. Although recent reports on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries have demonstrated performances comparable to their lithium-ion counterparts, the major scientific challenge for a competitive sodium-ion battery technology is to develop viable anode materials. Here we show that a hybrid material made out of a few phosphorene layers sandwiched between graphene layers shows a specific capacity of 2,440&#8197;mA&#8197;h&#8197;g<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (calculated using the mass of phosphorus only) at a current density of 0.05&#8197;A&#8197;g<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and an 83% capacity retention after 100 cycles while operating between 0 and 1.5&#8197;V. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy and ex situ X-ray diffraction techniques, we explain the large capacity of our anode through a dual mechanism of intercalation of sodium ions along the x axis of the phosphorene layers followed by the formation of a Na<sub>3</sub>P alloy. The presence of graphene layers in the hybrid material works as a mechanical backbone and an electrical highway, ensuring that a suitable elastic buffer space accommodates the anisotropic expansion of phosphorene layers along the y and z axial directions for stable cycling operation.</p>",[],False,"[""Jie Sun"", ""Hyun-Wook Lee"", ""Mauro Pasta"", ""Hongtao Yuan"", ""Guangyuan Zheng"", ""Yongming Sun"", ""Yuzhang Li"", ""Yi Cui""]","Sun, J., Lee, HW., Pasta, M. et al.A phosphorene–graphene hybrid material as a high-capacity anode for sodium-ion batteries.

article,High-throughput optical sensing of nucleic acids in a nanopore array,"<p>Protein nanopores such as &#945;-haemolysin and Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) can be used to sequence long strands of DNA at low cost. To provide high-speed sequencing, large arrays of nanopores are required, but current nanopore sequencing methods rely on ionic current measurements from individually addressed pores and such methods are likely to prove difficult to scale up. Here we show that, by optically encoding the ionic flux through protein nanopores, the discrimination of nucleic acid sequences and the detection of sequence-specific nucleic acid hybridization events can be parallelized. We make optical recordings at a density of &#8764;10<sup>4</sup> nanopores per mm<sup>2</sup> in a single droplet interface bilayer. Nanopore blockades can discriminate between DNAs with sub-picoampere equivalent resolution, and specific miRNA sequences can be identified by differences in unzipping kinetics. By creating an array of 2,500 bilayers with a micropatterned hydrogel chip, we are also able to load different samples into specific bilayers suitable for high-throughput nanopore recording.</p>",[],False,"[""Shuo Huang"", ""Mercedes Romero-Ruiz"", ""Oliver K.
