article,Antenna-coupled photon emission from hexagonal boron nitride tunnel junctions,"<p>The ultrafast conversion of electrical signals to optical signals at the nanoscale is of fundamental interest for data processing, telecommunication and optical interconnects. However, the modulation bandwidths of semiconductor light-emitting diodes are limited by the spontaneous recombination rate of electron&#8211;hole pairs, and the footprint of electrically driven ultrafast lasers is too large for practical on-chip integration. A metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal tunnel junction approaches the ultimate size limit of electronic devices and its operating speed is fundamentally limited only by the tunnelling time. Here, we study the conversion of electrons (localized in vertical gold&#8211;hexagonal boron nitride&#8211;gold tunnel junctions) to free-space photons, mediated by resonant slot antennas. Optical antennas efficiently bridge the size mismatch between nanoscale volumes and far-field radiation and strongly enhance the electron&#8211;photon conversion efficiency. We achieve polarized, directional and resonantly enhanced light emission from inelastic electron tunnelling and establish a novel platform for studying the interaction of electrons with strongly localized electromagnetic fields.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

article,Surface imaging beyond the diffraction limit with optically trapped spheres,"<p>Optical traps play an increasing role in the bionanosciences because of their ability to apply forces flexibly on tiny structures in fluid environments. Combined with particle-tracking techniques, they allow the sensing of miniscule forces exerted on these structures. Similar to atomic force microscopy (AFM), but much more sensitive, an optically trapped probe can be scanned across a structured surface to measure the height profile from the displacements of the probe. Here we demonstrate that, by the combination of a time-shared twin-optical trap and nanometre-precise three-dimensional interferometric particle tracking, both reliable height profiling and surface imaging are possible with a spatial resolution below the diffraction limit. The technique exploits the high-energy thermal position fluctuations of the trapped probe, and leads to a sampling of the surface 5,000 times softer than in AFM. The measured height and force profiles from test structures and Helicobacter cells illustrate the potential to uncover specific properties of hard and soft surfaces.</p>",[],False,"[""Lars Friedrich"", ""Alexander Rohrbach""]","Friedrich, L., Rohrbach, A.

article,Identification of single nucleotides in MoS2 nanopores,"<p>The size of the sensing region in solid-state nanopores is determined by the size of the pore and the thickness of the pore membrane, so ultrathin membranes such as graphene and single-layer molybdenum disulphide could potentially offer the necessary spatial resolution for nanopore DNA sequencing. However, the fast translocation speeds (3,000&#8211;50,000&#8197;nt&#8197;ms<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) of DNA molecules moving across such membranes limit their usability. Here, we show that a viscosity gradient system based on room-temperature ionic liquids can be used to control the dynamics of DNA translocation through MoS<sub>2</sub> nanopores. The approach can be used to statistically detect all four types of nucleotide, which are identified according to current signatures recorded during their transient residence in the narrow orifice of the atomically thin MoS<sub>2</sub> nanopore. Our technique, which exploits the high viscosity of room-temperature ionic liquids, provides optimal single nucleotide translocation speeds for DNA sequencing, while maintaining a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiandong Feng"", ""Ke Liu"", ""Roman D.

article,Hierarchically arranged helical fibre actuators driven by solvents and vapours,"<p>Mechanical responsiveness in many plants is produced by helical organizations of cellulose microfibrils. However, simple mimicry of these naturally occurring helical structures does not produce artificial materials with the desired tunable actuations. Here, we show that actuating fibres that respond to solvent and vapour stimuli can be created through the hierarchical and helical assembly of aligned carbon nanotubes. Primary fibres consisting of helical assemblies of multiwalled carbon nanotubes are twisted together to form the helical actuating fibres. The nanoscale gaps between the nanotubes and micrometre-scale gaps among the primary fibres contribute to the rapid response and large actuation stroke of the actuating fibres. The compact coils allow the actuating fibre to rotate reversibly. We show that these fibres, which are lightweight, flexible and strong, are suitable for a variety of applications such as energy-harvesting generators, deformable sensing springs and smart textiles.</p>",[],False,"[""Peining Chen"", ""Yifan Xu"", ""Sisi He"", ""Xuemei Sun"", ""Shaowu Pan"", ""Jue Deng"", ""Daoyong Chen"", ""Huisheng Peng""]","Chen, P., Xu, Y., He, S. et al.
