article,Long-range and rapid transport of individual nano-objects by a hybrid electrothermoplasmonic nanotweezer,"<p>Plasmon-enhanced optical trapping is being actively studied to provide efficient manipulation of nanometre-sized objects. However, a long-standing issue with previously proposed solutions is how to controllably load the trap on-demand without relying on Brownian diffusion. Here, we show that the photo-induced heating of a nanoantenna in conjunction with an applied a.c. electric field can initiate rapid microscale fluid motion and particle transport with a velocity exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;m&#8197;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup>, which is over two orders of magnitude faster than previously predicted. Our electrothermoplasmonic device enables on-demand long-range and rapid delivery of single nano-objects to specific plasmonic nanoantennas, where they can be trapped and even locked in place. We also present a physical model that elucidates the role of both heat-induced fluidic motion and plasmonic field enhancement in the plasmon-assisted optical trapping process. Finally, by applying a d.c. field or low-frequency a.c. field (below 10&#8197;Hz) while the particle is held in the trap by the gradient force, the trapped nano-objects can be immobilized into plasmonic hotspots, thereby providing the potential for effective low-power nanomanufacturing on-chip.</p>",[],False,"[""Justus C.

article,Harnessing structural darkness in the visible and infrared wavelengths for a new source of light,"<p>Engineering broadband light absorbers is crucial to many applications, including energy-harvesting devices and optical interconnects. The performances of an ideal absorber are that of a black body, a dark material that absorbs radiation at all angles and polarizations. Despite advances in micrometre-thick films, the absorbers available to date are still far from an ideal black body. Here, we describe a disordered nanostructured material that shows an almost ideal black-body absorption of 98&#8211;99% between 400 and 1,400&#8197;nm that is insensitive to the angle and polarization of the incident light. The material comprises nanoparticles composed of a nanorod with a nanosphere of 30&#8197;nm diameter attached. When diluted into liquids, a small concentration of nanoparticles absorbs on average 26% more than carbon nanotubes, the darkest material available to date. By pumping a dye optical amplifier with nanosecond pulses of &#8764;100&#8197;mW power, we harness the structural darkness of the material and create a new type of light source, which generates monochromatic emission (&#8764;5&#8197;nm wide) without the need for any resonance. This is achieved through the dynamics of light condensation in which all absorbed electromagnetic energy spontaneously generates single-colour energy pulses.</p>",[],False,"[""Jianfeng Huang"", ""Changxu Liu"", ""Yihan Zhu"", ""Silvia Masala"", ""Erkki Alarousu"", ""Yu Han"", ""Andrea Fratalocchi""]","Huang, J., Liu, C., Zhu, Y. et al.

article,"Nanoscale cation motion in TaOx, HfOx and TiOx memristive systems","<p>A detailed understanding of the resistive switching mechanisms that operate in redox-based resistive random-access memories (ReRAM) is key to controlling these memristive devices and formulating appropriate design rules. Based on distinct fundamental switching mechanisms, two types of ReRAM have emerged: electrochemical metallization memories, in which the mobile species is thought to be metal cations, and valence change memories, in which the mobile species is thought to be oxygen anions (or positively charged oxygen vacancies). Here we show, using scanning tunnelling microscopy and supported by potentiodynamic current&#8211;voltage measurements, that in three typical valence change memory materials (TaO<sub>x</sub>, HfO<sub>x</sub> and TiO<sub>x</sub>) the host metal cations are mobile in films of 2&#8197;nm thickness. The cations can form metallic filaments and participate in the resistive switching process, illustrating that there is a bridge between the electrochemical metallization mechanism and the valence change mechanism. Reset/Set operations are, we suggest, driven by oxidation (passivation) and reduction reactions. For the Ta/Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> system, a rutile-type TaO<sub>2</sub> film is believed to mediate switching, and we show that devices can be switched from a valence change mode to an electrochemical metallization mode by introducing an intermediate layer of amorphous carbon.</p>",[],False,"[""Anja Wedig"", ""Michael Luebben"", ""Deok-Yong Cho"", ""Marco Moors"", ""Katharina Skaja"", ""Vikas Rana"", ""Tsuyoshi Hasegawa"", ""Kiran K.

article,Improved air stability of perovskite solar cells via solution-processed metal oxide transport layers,"<p>Lead halide perovskite solar cells have recently attracted tremendous attention because of their excellent photovoltaic efficiencies. However, the poor stability of both the perovskite material and the charge transport layers has so far prevented the fabrication of devices that can withstand sustained operation under normal conditions. Here, we report a solution-processed lead halide perovskite solar cell that has p-type NiO<sub>x</sub> and n-type ZnO nanoparticles as hole and electron transport layers, respectively, and shows improved stability against water and oxygen degradation when compared with devices with organic charge transport layers. Our cells have a p&#8211;i&#8211;n structure (glass/indium tin oxide/NiO<sub>x</sub>/perovskite/ZnO/Al), in which the ZnO layer isolates the perovskite and Al layers, thus preventing degradation. After 60&#8197;days storage in air at room temperature, our all-metal-oxide devices retain about 90% of their original efficiency, unlike control devices made with organic transport layers, which undergo a complete degradation after just 5&#8197;days. The initial power conversion efficiency of our devices is 14.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.5%, with an uncertified maximum value of 16.1%.</p>",[],False,"[""Jingbi You"", ""Lei Meng"", ""Tze-Bin Song"", ""Tzung-Fang Guo"", ""Yang (Michael) Yang"", ""Wei-Hsuan Chang"", ""Ziruo Hong"", ""Huajun Chen"", ""Huanping Zhou"", ""Qi Chen"", ""Yongsheng Liu"", ""Nicholas De Marco"", ""Yang Yang""]","You, J., Meng, L., Song, TB. et al.

article,Reversible trapping and reaction acceleration within dynamically self-assembling nanoflasks,"<p>The chemical behaviour of molecules can be significantly modified by confinement to volumes comparable to the dimensions of the molecules. Although such confined spaces can be found in various nanostructured materials, such as zeolites, nanoporous organic frameworks and colloidal nanocrystal assemblies, the slow diffusion of molecules in and out of these materials has greatly hampered studying the effect of confinement on their physicochemical properties. Here, we show that this diffusion limitation can be overcome by reversibly creating and destroying confined environments by means of ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. We use colloidal nanocrystals functionalized with light-responsive ligands that readily self-assemble and trap various molecules from the surrounding bulk solution. Once trapped, these molecules can undergo chemical reactions with increased rates and with stereoselectivities significantly different from those in bulk solution. Illumination with visible light disassembles these nanoflasks, releasing the product in solution and thereby establishes a catalytic cycle. These dynamic nanoflasks can be useful for studying chemical reactivities in confined environments and for synthesizing molecules that are otherwise hard to achieve in bulk solution.</p>",[],False,"[""Hui Zhao"", ""Soumyo Sen"", ""T.

article,Monovalent Strep-Tactin for strong and site-specific tethering in nanospectroscopy,"<p>Strep-Tactin, an engineered form of streptavidin, binds avidly to the genetically encoded peptide Strep-tag II in a manner comparable to streptavidin binding to biotin. These interactions have been used in protein purification and detection applications. However, in single-molecule studies, for example using atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS), the tetravalency of these systems impedes the measurement of monodispersed data. Here, we introduce a monovalent form of Strep-Tactin that harbours a unique binding site for Strep-tag II and a single cysteine that allows Strep-Tactin to specifically attach to the atomic force microscope cantilever and form a consistent pulling geometry to obtain homogeneous rupture data. Using AFM-SMFS, the mechanical properties of the interaction between Strep-tag II and monovalent Strep-Tactin were characterized. Rupture forces comparable to biotin:streptavidin unbinding were observed. Using titin kinase and green fluorescent protein, we show that monovalent Strep-Tactin is generally applicable to protein unfolding experiments. We expect monovalent Strep-Tactin to be a reliable anchoring tool for a range of single-molecule studies.</p>",[],False,"[""Fabian Baumann"", ""Magnus S. Bauer"", ""Lukas F.

article,A multiphase transitioning peptide hydrogel for suturing ultrasmall vessels,"<p>Many surgeries are complicated by the need to anastomose, or reconnect, micrometre-scale vessels. Although suturing remains the gold standard for anastomosing vessels, it is difficult to place sutures correctly through collapsed lumen, making the procedure prone to failure. Here, we report a multiphase transitioning peptide hydrogel that can be injected into the lumen of vessels to facilitate suturing. The peptide, which contains a photocaged glutamic acid, forms a solid-like gel in a syringe and can be shear-thin delivered to the lumen of collapsed vessels (where it distends the vessel) and the space between two vessels (where it is used to approximate the vessel ends). Suturing is performed directly through the gel. Light is used to initiate the final gel&#8211;sol phase transition that disrupts the hydrogel network, allowing the gel to be removed and blood flow to resume. This gel adds a new tool to the armamentarium for micro- and supermicrosurgical procedures.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel J. Smith"", ""Gabriel A. Brat"", ""Scott H.
