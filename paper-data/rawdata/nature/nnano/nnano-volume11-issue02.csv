article,Molecular cavity optomechanics as a theory of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering,"<p>The exceptional enhancement of Raman scattering by localized plasmonic resonances in the near field of metallic nanoparticles, surfaces or tips (SERS, TERS) has enabled spectroscopic fingerprinting down to the single molecule level. The conventional explanation attributes the enhancement to the subwavelength confinement of the electromagnetic field near nanoantennas. Here, we introduce a new model that also accounts for the dynamical nature of the plasmon&#8211;molecule interaction. We thereby reveal an enhancement mechanism not considered before: dynamical backaction amplification of molecular vibrations. We first map the system onto the canonical Hamiltonian of cavity optomechanics, in which the molecular vibration and the plasmon are parametrically coupled. We express the vacuum optomechanical coupling rate for individual molecules in plasmonic &#8216;hot-spots&#8217; in terms of the vibrational mode's Raman activity and find it to be orders of magnitude larger than for microfabricated optomechanical systems. Remarkably, the frequency of commonly studied molecular vibrations can be comparable to or larger than the plasmon's decay rate. Together, these considerations predict that an excitation laser blue-detuned from the plasmon resonance can parametrically amplify the molecular vibration, leading to a nonlinear enhancement of Raman emission that is not predicted by the conventional theory. Our optomechanical approach recovers known results, provides a quantitative framework for the calculation of cross-sections, and enables the design of novel systems that leverage dynamical backaction to achieve additional, mode-selective enhancements. It also provides a quantum mechanical framework to analyse plasmon&#8211;vibrational interactions in terms of molecular quantum optomechanics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Condensed Matter Physics, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015, Lausanne, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Philippe Roelli', ',\xa0Christophe Galland', ',\xa0Nicolas Piro', '\xa0&\xa0Tobias J.

article,Field-induced conductance switching by charge-state alternation in organometallic single-molecule junctions,"<p>Charge transport through single molecules can be influenced by the charge and spin states of redox-active metal centres placed in the transport pathway. These intrinsic properties are usually manipulated by varying the molecule's electrochemical and magnetic environment, a procedure that requires complex setups with multiple terminals. Here we show that oxidation and reduction of organometallic compounds containing either Fe, Ru or Mo centres can solely be triggered by the electric field applied to a two-terminal molecular junction. Whereas all compounds exhibit bias-dependent hysteresis, the Mo-containing compound additionally shows an abrupt voltage-induced conductance switching, yielding high-to-low current ratios exceeding 1,000 at bias voltages of less than 1.0&#8197;V. Density functional theory calculations identify a localized, redox-active molecular orbital that is weakly coupled to the electrodes and closely aligned with the Fermi energy of the leads because of the spin-polarized ground state unique to the Mo centre. This situation provides an additional slow and incoherent hopping channel for transport, triggering a transient charging effect in the entire molecule with a strong hysteresis and large high-to-low current ratios.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Research - Zurich, Säumerstrasse 4, Rüschlikon, 8803, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Florian Schwarz', '\xa0&\xa0Emanuel Lörtscher']}, {'address': 'Department of Physical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Sensengasse 8/7, Vienna, 1090, Austria', 'authors': ['Georg Kastlunger', '\xa0&\xa0Robert Stadler']}, {'address': 'Institute for Theoretical Physics, TU Wien - Vienna University of Technology, Wiedner Hauptstrasse 8-10, Vienna, 1040, Austria', 'authors': ['Georg Kastlunger', '\xa0&\xa0Robert Stadler']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Zürich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, Zürich, 8057, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Franziska Lissel', ',\xa0Carolina Egler-Lucas', ',\xa0Sergey N.

article,Non-Boolean computing with nanomagnets for computer vision applications,"<p>The field of nanomagnetism has recently attracted tremendous attention as it can potentially deliver low-power, high-speed and dense non-volatile memories. It is now possible to engineer the size, shape, spacing, orientation and composition of sub-100&#8197;nm magnetic structures. This has spurred the exploration of nanomagnets for unconventional computing paradigms. Here, we harness the energy-minimization nature of nanomagnetic systems to solve the quadratic optimization problems that arise in computer vision applications, which are computationally expensive. By exploiting the magnetization states of nanomagnetic disks as state representations of a vortex and single domain, we develop a magnetic Hamiltonian and implement it in a magnetic system that can identify the salient features of a given image with more than 85% true positive rate. These results show the potential of this alternative computing method to develop a magnetic coprocessor that might solve complex problems in fewer clock cycles than traditional processors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, 33620, Florida, USA', 'authors': ['Sanjukta Bhanja', ',\xa0D.

article,High-speed DNA-based rolling motors powered by RNase H,"<p>DNA-based machines that walk by converting chemical energy into controlled motion could be of use in applications such as next-generation sensors, drug-delivery platforms and biological computing. Despite their exquisite programmability, DNA-based walkers are challenging to work with because of their low fidelity and slow rates (&#8764;1&#8197;nm min<sup>&#8211;1</sup>). Here we report DNA-based machines that roll rather than walk, and consequently have a maximum speed and processivity that is three orders of magnitude greater than the maximum for conventional DNA motors. The motors are made from DNA-coated spherical particles that hybridize to a surface modified with complementary RNA; the motion is achieved through the addition of RNase H, which selectively hydrolyses the hybridized RNA. The spherical motors can move in a self-avoiding manner, and anisotropic particles, such as dimerized or rod-shaped particles, can travel linearly without a track or external force. We also show that the motors can be used to detect single nucleotide polymorphism by measuring particle displacement using a smartphone camera.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Emory University, 1515 Dickey Drive, Atlanta, 30322, Georgia, USA', 'authors': ['Kevin Yehl', ',\xa0Yang Liu', ',\xa0Yun Zhang', ',\xa0Mengzhen Fan', '\xa0&\xa0Khalid Salaita']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Emory University, 400 Dowman Drive, Atlanta, 30322, Georgia, USA', 'authors': ['Andrew Mugler', ',\xa0Skanda Vivek', '\xa0&\xa0Eric R.

article,Macromolecular crowding creates heterogeneous environments of gene expression in picolitre droplets,"<p>Understanding the dynamics of complex enzymatic reactions in highly crowded small volumes is crucial for the development of synthetic minimal cells. Compartmentalized biochemical reactions in cell-sized containers exhibit a degree of randomness due to the small number of molecules involved. However, it is unknown how the physical environment contributes to the stochastic nature of multistep enzymatic processes. Here, we present a robust method to quantify gene expression noise in vitro using droplet microfluidics. We study the changes in stochasticity in the cell-free gene expression of two genes compartmentalized within droplets as a function of DNA copy number and macromolecular crowding. We find that decreased diffusion caused by a crowded environment leads to the spontaneous formation of heterogeneous microenvironments of mRNA as local production rates exceed the diffusion rates of macromolecules. This heterogeneity leads to a higher probability of the molecular machinery staying in the same microenvironment, directly increasing the system's stochasticity.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Radboud University, Institute for Molecules and Materials, Heyendaalseweg 135, AJ Nijmegen, 6525, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Maike M.

Here, we apply value of information and portfolio decision analysis&#8212;methods commonly applied in financial and operations management&#8212;to prioritize risk research for multiwalled carbon nanotubes and nanoparticulate silver and titanium dioxide. We modify the widely accepted CB Nanotool hazard evaluation framework, which combines nano- and bulk-material properties into a hazard score, to operate probabilistically with uncertain inputs. Literature is reviewed to develop uncertain estimates for each input parameter, and a Monte Carlo simulation is applied to assess how different research strategies can improve hazard classification. The relative cost of each research experiment is elicited from experts, which enables identification of efficient research portfolios&#8212;combinations of experiments that lead to the greatest improvement in hazard classification at the lowest cost.
