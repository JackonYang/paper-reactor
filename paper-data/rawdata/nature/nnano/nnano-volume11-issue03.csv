article,An ultrabright and monochromatic electron point source made of a LaB6 nanowire,"<p>Electron sources in the form of one-dimensional nanotubes and nanowires are an essential tool for investigations in a variety of fields, such as X-ray computed tomography, flexible displays, chemical sensors and electron optics applications. However, field emission instability and the need to work under high-vacuum or high-temperature conditions have imposed stringent requirements that are currently limiting the range of application of electron sources. Here we report the fabrication of a LaB<sub>6</sub> nanowire with only a few La atoms bonded on the tip that emits collimated electrons from a single point with high monochromaticity. The nanostructured tip has a low work function of 2.07&#8197;eV (lower than that of Cs) while remaining chemically inert, two properties usually regarded as mutually exclusive. Installed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) field emission gun, our tip shows a current density gain that is about 1,000 times greater than that achievable with W(310) tips, and no emission decay for tens of hours of operation. Using this new SEM, we acquired very low-noise, high-resolution images together with rapid chemical compositional mapping using a tip operated at room temperature and at 10-times higher residual gas pressure than that required for W tips.</p>",[],False,"[""Han Zhang"", ""Jie Tang"", ""Jinshi Yuan"", ""Yasushi Yamauchi"", ""Taku T.

article,Spin-wave-beam driven synchronization of nanocontact spin-torque oscillators,"<p>The synchronization of multiple nanocontact spin-torque oscillators (NC-STOs) is mediated by propagating spin waves (SWs). Although it has been shown that the Oersted field generated in the vicinity of the NC can dramatically alter the emission pattern of SWs, its role in the synchronization behaviour of multiple NCs has not been considered so far. Here we investigate the synchronization behaviour in multiple NC-STOs oriented either vertically or horizontally, with respect to the in-plane component of the external field. Synchronization is promoted (impeded) by the Oersted field landscape when the NCs are oriented vertically (horizontally) due to the highly anisotropic SW propagation. Not only is robust synchronization between two oscillators observed for separations larger than 1,000&#8197;nm, but synchronization of up to five oscillators, a new record, has been observed in the vertical array geometry. Furthermore, the synchronization can no longer be considered mutual in nature.</p>",[],False,"[""A. Houshang"", ""E. Iacocca"", ""P. D\u00fcrrenfeld"", ""S. R. Sani"", ""J. \u00c5kerman"", ""R. K.

article,Computing in mammalian cells with nucleic acid strand exchange,"<p>DNA strand displacement has been widely used for the design of molecular circuits, motors, and sensors in cell-free settings. Recently, it has been shown that this technology can also operate in biological environments, but capabilities remain limited. Here, we look to adapt strand displacement and exchange reactions to mammalian cells and report DNA circuitry that can directly interact with a native mRNA. We began by optimizing the cellular performance of fluorescent reporters based on four-way strand exchange reactions and identified robust design principles by systematically varying the molecular structure, chemistry and delivery method. Next, we developed and tested AND and OR logic gates based on four-way strand exchange, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-input logic. Finally, we established that functional siRNA could be activated through strand exchange, and used native mRNA as programmable scaffolds for co-localizing gates and visualizing their operation with subcellular resolution.</p>",[],False,"[""Benjamin Groves"", ""Yuan-Jyue Chen"", ""Chiara Zurla"", ""Sergii Pochekailov"", ""Jonathan L.

article,In situ vaccination with cowpea mosaic virus nanoparticles suppresses metastatic cancer,"<p>Nanotechnology has tremendous potential to contribute to cancer immunotherapy. The &#8216;in situ vaccination&#8217; immunotherapy strategy directly manipulates identified tumours to overcome local tumour-mediated immunosuppression and subsequently stimulates systemic antitumour immunity to treat metastases. We show that inhalation of self-assembling virus-like nanoparticles from cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) reduces established B16F10 lung melanoma and simultaneously generates potent systemic antitumour immunity against poorly immunogenic B16F10 in the skin. Full efficacy required Il-12, Ifn-&#947;, adaptive immunity and neutrophils. Inhaled CPMV nanoparticles were rapidly taken up by and activated neutrophils in the tumour microenvironment as an important part of the antitumour immune response. CPMV also exhibited clear treatment efficacy and systemic antitumour immunity in ovarian, colon, and breast tumour models in multiple anatomic locations. CPMV nanoparticles are stable, nontoxic, modifiable with drugs and antigens, and their nanomanufacture is highly scalable. These properties, combined with their inherent immunogenicity and demonstrated efficacy against a poorly immunogenic tumour, make CPMV an attractive and novel immunotherapy against metastatic cancer.</p>",[],False,"[""P.
