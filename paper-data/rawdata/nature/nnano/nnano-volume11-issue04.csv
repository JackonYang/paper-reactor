article,Gate-induced superconductivity in atomically thin MoS2 crystals,"<p>When thinned down to the atomic scale, many layered van der Waals materials exhibit an interesting evolution of their electronic properties, whose main aspects can be accounted for by changes in the single-particle bandstructure. Phenomena driven by interactions are also observed, but identifying experimentally systematic trends in their thickness dependence is challenging. Here, we explore the evolution of gate-induced superconductivity in exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> multilayers ranging from bulk-like to individual monolayers. We observe a clear transition for all thicknesses down to the ultimate atomic limit, providing the first demonstration of gate-induced superconductivity in atomically thin exfoliated crystals. Additionally, we characterize the superconducting state by measuring the critical temperature T<sub>C</sub> and magnetic field B<sub>C</sub> in a large number of multilayer devices while decreasing their thickness. We find that the superconducting properties exhibit a pronounced reduction in T<sub>C</sub> and B<sub>C</sub> when going from bilayers to monolayers, for which we discuss possible microscopic mechanisms.</p>",[],False,"[""Davide Costanzo"", ""Sanghyun Jo"", ""Helmuth Berger"", ""Alberto F.

article,Magnetic field-induced helical mode and topological transitions in a topological insulator nanoribbon,"<p>The spin-helical Dirac fermion topological surface states in a topological insulator nanowire or nanoribbon promise novel topological devices and exotic physics such as Majorana fermions. Here, we report local and non-local transport measurements in Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> topological insulator nanoribbons that exhibit quasi-ballistic transport over &#8764;2&#8197;&#956;m.

These oscillations enable us to probe the Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> band structure, and are consistent with the circumferentially quantized topological surface states forming a series of one-dimensional subbands, which undergo periodic magnetic field-induced topological transitions with the disappearance/appearance of the gapless Dirac point with a one-dimensional spin helical mode.</p>",[],False,"[""Luis A.

article,Electric-field control of spin–orbit torque in a magnetically doped topological insulator,"<p>Electric-field manipulation of magnetic order has proved of both fundamental and technological importance in spintronic devices. So far, electric-field control of ferromagnetism, magnetization and magnetic anisotropy has been explored in various magnetic materials, but the efficient electric-field control of spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) still remains elusive. Here, we report the effective electric-field control of a giant SOT in a Cr-doped topological insulator (TI) thin film using a top-gate field-effect transistor structure. The SOT strength can be modulated by a factor of four within the accessible gate voltage range, and it shows strong correlation with the spin-polarized surface current in the film. Furthermore, we demonstrate the magnetization switching by scanning gate voltage with constant current and in-plane magnetic field applied in the film. The effective electric-field control of SOT and the giant spin-torque efficiency in Cr-doped TI may lead to the development of energy-efficient gate-controlled spin-torque devices compatible with modern field-effect semiconductor technologies.</p>",[],False,"[""Yabin Fan"", ""Xufeng Kou"", ""Pramey Upadhyaya"", ""Qiming Shao"", ""Lei Pan"", ""Murong Lang"", ""Xiaoyu Che"", ""Jianshi Tang"", ""Mohammad Montazeri"", ""Koichi Murata"", ""Li-Te Chang"", ""Mustafa Akyol"", ""Guoqiang Yu"", ""Tianxiao Nie"", ""Kin L.

article,Spin-torque resonant expulsion of the vortex core for an efficient radiofrequency detection scheme,"<p>It has been proposed that high-frequency detectors based on the so-called spin-torque diode effect in spin transfer oscillators could eventually replace conventional Schottky diodes due to their nanoscale size, frequency tunability and large output sensitivity. Although a promising candidate for information and communications technology applications, the output voltage generated from this effect has still to be improved and, more pertinently, reduces drastically with decreasing radiofrequency (RF) current. Here we present a scheme for a new type of spintronics-based high-frequency detector based on the expulsion of the vortex core in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). The resonant expulsion of the core leads to a large and sharp change in resistance associated with the difference in magnetoresistance between the vortex ground state and the final C-state configuration. Interestingly, this reversible effect is independent of the incoming RF current amplitude, offering a fast real-time RF threshold detector.</p>",[],False,"[""A. S. Jenkins"", ""R. Lebrun"", ""E.

article,Amyloid–carbon hybrid membranes for universal water purification,"<p>Industrial development, energy production and mining have led to dramatically increased levels of environmental pollutants such as heavy metal ions, metal cyanides and nuclear waste. Current technologies for purifying contaminated waters are typically expensive and ion specific, and there is therefore a significant need for new approaches. Here, we report inexpensive hybrid membranes made from protein amyloid fibrils and activated porous carbon that can be used to remove heavy metal ions and radioactive waste from water. During filtration, the concentration of heavy metal ions drops by three to five orders of magnitude per passage and the process can be repeated numerous times. Notably, their efficiency remains unaltered when filtering several ions simultaneously. The performance of the membrane is enabled by the ability of the amyloids to selectively absorb heavy metal pollutants from solutions. We also show that our membranes can be used to recycle valuable heavy metal contaminants by thermally reducing ions trapped in saturated membranes, leading to the creation of elemental metal nanoparticles and films.</p>",[],False,"[""Sreenath Bolisetty"", ""Raffaele Mezzenga""]","Bolisetty, S., Mezzenga, R.

article,Protein adsorption is required for stealth effect of poly(ethylene glycol)- and poly(phosphoester)-coated nanocarriers,"<p>The current gold standard to reduce non-specific cellular uptake of drug delivery vehicles is by covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). It is thought that PEG can reduce protein adsorption and thereby confer a stealth effect. Here, we show that polystyrene nanocarriers that have been modified with PEG or poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate) (PEEP) and exposed to plasma proteins exhibit a low cellular uptake, whereas those not exposed to plasma proteins show high non-specific uptake. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that exposed nanocarriers formed a protein corona that contains an abundance of clusterin proteins (also known as apolipoprotein J). When the polymer-modified nanocarriers were incubated with clusterin, non-specific cellular uptake could be reduced. Our results show that in addition to reducing protein adsorption, PEG, and now PEEPs, can affect the composition of the protein corona that forms around nanocarriers, and the presence of distinct proteins is necessary to prevent non-specific cellular uptake.</p>",[],False,"[""Susanne Sch\u00f6ttler"", ""Greta Becker"", ""Svenja Winzen"", ""Tobias Steinbach"", ""Kristin Mohr"", ""Katharina Landfester"", ""Volker Mail\u00e4nder"", ""Frederik R.

article,A photoactivable multi-inhibitor nanoliposome for tumour control and simultaneous inhibition of treatment escape pathways,"<p>Nanoscale drug delivery vehicles can facilitate multimodal therapies of cancer by promoting tumour-selective drug release. However, few are effective because cancer cells develop ways to resist and evade treatment. Here, we introduce a photoactivable multi-inhibitor nanoliposome (PMIL) that imparts light-induced cytotoxicity in synchrony with a photoinitiated and sustained release of inhibitors that suppress tumour regrowth and treatment escape signalling pathways. The PMIL consists of a nanoliposome doped with a photoactivable chromophore (benzoporphyrin derivative, BPD) in the lipid bilayer, and a nanoparticle containing cabozantinib (XL184)&#8212;a multikinase inhibitor&#8212;encapsulated inside. Near-infrared tumour irradiation, following intravenous PMIL administration, triggers photodynamic damage of tumour cells and microvessels, and simultaneously initiates release of XL184 inside the tumour. A single PMIL treatment achieves prolonged tumour reduction in two mouse models and suppresses metastatic escape in an orthotopic pancreatic tumour model. The PMIL offers new prospects for cancer therapy by enabling spatiotemporal control of drug release while reducing systemic drug exposure and associated toxicities.</p>",[],False,"[""Bryan Q.

article,Bioinspired fluorescent dipeptide nanoparticles for targeted cancer cell imaging and real-time monitoring of drug release,"<p>Peptide nanostructures are biodegradable and are suitable for many biomedical applications. However, to be useful imaging probes, the limited intrinsic optical properties of peptides must be overcome. Here we show the formation of tryptophan&#8211;phenylalanine dipeptide nanoparticles (DNPs) that can shift the peptide's intrinsic fluorescent signal from the ultraviolet to the visible range. The visible emission signal allows the DNPs to act as imaging and sensing probes. The peptide design is inspired by the red shift seen in the yellow fluorescent protein that results from &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and by the enhanced fluorescence intensity seen in the green fluorescent protein mutant, BFPms1, which results from the structure rigidification by Zn(II). We show that DNPs are photostable, biocompatible and have a narrow emission bandwidth and visible fluorescence properties.
