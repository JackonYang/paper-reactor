article,A reconfigurable waveguide for energy-efficient transmission and local manipulation of information in a nanomagnetic device,"<p>Spin-wave-based devices promise to usher in an era of low-power computing where information is carried by the precession of the electrons' spin instead of dissipative translation of their charge. This potential is, however, undermined by the need for a bias magnetic field, which must remain powered on to maintain an anisotropic device characteristic. Here, we propose a reconfigurable waveguide design that can transmit and locally manipulate spin waves without the need for any external bias field once initialized. We experimentally demonstrate the transmission of spin waves in straight as well as curved waveguides without a bias field, which has been elusive so far. Furthermore, we experimentally show a binary gating of the spin-wave signal by controlled switching of the magnetization, locally, in the waveguide. The results have potential implications in high-density integration and energy-efficient operation of nanomagnetic devices at room temperature.</p>",[],False,"[""Arabinda Haldar"", ""Dheeraj Kumar"", ""Adekunle Olusola Adeyeye""]","Haldar, A., Kumar, D. & Adeyeye, A.

article,Additive interfacial chiral interaction in multilayers for stabilization of small individual skyrmions at room temperature,"<p>Facing the ever-growing demand for data storage will most probably require a new paradigm. Nanoscale magnetic skyrmions are anticipated to solve this issue as they are arguably the smallest spin textures in magnetic thin films in nature. We designed cobalt-based multilayered thin films in which the cobalt layer is sandwiched between two heavy metals and so provides additive interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions (DMIs), which reach a value close to 2&#8197;mJ m<sup>&#8211;2</sup> in the case of the Ir|Co|Pt asymmetric multilayers. Using a magnetization-sensitive scanning X-ray transmission microscopy technique, we imaged small magnetic domains at very low fields in these multilayers. The study of their behaviour in a perpendicular magnetic field allows us to conclude that they are actually magnetic skyrmions stabilized by the large DMI. This discovery of stable sub-100&#8197;nm individual skyrmions at room temperature in a technologically relevant material opens the way for device applications in the near future.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

article,Room-temperature chiral magnetic skyrmions in ultrathin magnetic nanostructures,"<p>Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin structures with a whirling configuration. Their topological properties, nanometre size and the fact that they can be moved by small current densities have opened a new paradigm for the manipulation of magnetization at the nanoscale. Chiral skyrmion structures have so far been experimentally demonstrated only in bulk materials and in epitaxial ultrathin films, and under an external magnetic field or at low temperature. Here, we report on the observation of stable skyrmions in sputtered ultrathin Pt/Co/MgO nanostructures at room temperature and zero external magnetic field. We use high lateral resolution X-ray magnetic circular dichroism microscopy to image their chiral N&#233;el internal structure, which we explain as due to the large strength of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction as revealed by spin wave spectroscopy measurements.

A novel advancement would be to develop ultrafast spintronics using femtosecond laser pulses. Employing terahertz (10<sup>12</sup>&#8197;Hz) emission spectroscopy and exploiting the spin&#8211;orbit interaction, we demonstrate the optical generation of electric photocurrents in metallic ferromagnetic heterostructures at the femtosecond timescale.

article,Plasmonic nanofocused four-wave mixing for femtosecond near-field imaging,"<p>Femtosecond nonlinear optical imaging with nanoscale spatial resolution would provide access to coupled degrees of freedom and ultrafast response functions on the characteristic length scales of electronic and vibrational excitations. Although near-field microscopy provides the desired spatial resolution, the design of a broadband high-contrast nanoprobe for ultrafast temporal resolution is challenging due to the inherently weak nonlinear optical signals generated in subwavelength volumes. Here, we demonstrate broadband four-wave mixing with enhanced nonlinear frequency conversion efficiency at the apex of a nanometre conical tip. Far-field light is coupled through a grating at the shaft of the tip, generating plasmons that propagate to the apex while undergoing asymptotic compression and amplification, resulting in a nonlinear conversion efficiency of up to 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8211;5</sup>. We apply this nonlinear nanoprobe to image the few-femtosecond coherent dynamics of plasmonic hotspots on a nanostructured gold surface with spatial resolution of a few tens of nanometres. The approach can be generalized towards spatiotemporal imaging and control of coherent dynamics on the nanoscale, including the extension to multidimensional spectroscopy and imaging.</p>",[],False,"[""Vasily Kravtsov"", ""Ronald Ulbricht"", ""Joanna M.

article,Surface functionalization of two-dimensional metal chalcogenides by Lewis acid–base chemistry,"<p>Precise control of the electronic surface states of two-dimensional (2D) materials could improve their versatility and widen their applicability in electronics and sensing. To this end, chemical surface functionalization has been used to adjust the electronic properties of 2D materials. So far, however, chemical functionalization has relied on lattice defects and physisorption methods that inevitably modify the topological characteristics of the atomic layers. Here we make use of the lone pair electrons found in most of 2D metal chalcogenides and report a functionalization method via a Lewis acid&#8211;base reaction that does not alter the host structure. Atomic layers of n-type InSe react with Ti<sup>4+</sup> to form planar p-type [Ti<sup>4+</sup><sub>n</sub>(InSe)] coordination complexes. Using this strategy, we fabricate planar p&#8211;n junctions on 2D InSe with improved rectification and photovoltaic properties, without requiring heterostructure growth procedures or device fabrication processes. We also show that this functionalization approach works with other Lewis acids (such as B<sup>3+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup> and Sn<sup>4+</sup>) and can be applied to other 2D materials (for example MoS<sub>2</sub>, MoSe<sub>2</sub>). Finally, we show that it is possible to use Lewis acid&#8211;base chemistry as a bridge to connect molecules to 2D atomic layers and fabricate a proof-of-principle dye-sensitized photosensing device.</p>",[],False,"[""Sidong Lei"", ""Xifan Wang"", ""Bo Li"", ""Jiahao Kang"", ""Yongmin He"", ""Antony George"", ""Liehui Ge"", ""Yongji Gong"", ""Pei Dong"", ""Zehua Jin"", ""Gustavo Brunetto"", ""Weibing Chen"", ""Zuan-Tao Lin"", ""Robert Baines"", ""Douglas S.

article,A transparent bending-insensitive pressure sensor,"<p>Measuring small normal pressures is essential to accurately evaluate external stimuli in curvilinear and dynamic surfaces such as natural tissues. Usually, sensitive and spatially accurate pressure sensors are achieved through conformal contact with the surface; however, this also makes them sensitive to mechanical deformation (bending). Indeed, when a soft object is pressed by another soft object, the normal pressure cannot be measured independently from the mechanical stress. Here, we show a pressure sensor that measures only the normal pressure, even under extreme bending conditions. To reduce the bending sensitivity, we use composite nanofibres of carbon nanotubes and graphene. Our simulations show that these fibres change their relative alignment to accommodate bending deformation, thus reducing the strain in individual fibres. Pressure sensitivity is maintained down to a bending radius of 80&#8197;&#956;m. To test the suitability of our sensor for soft robotics and medical applications, we fabricated an integrated sensor matrix that is only 2&#8197;&#956;m thick.

article,Meta-analysis of cellular toxicity for cadmium-containing quantum dots,"<p>Understanding the relationships between the physicochemical properties of engineered nanomaterials and their toxicity is critical for environmental and health risk analysis. However, this task is confounded by material diversity, heterogeneity of published data and limited sampling within individual studies. Here, we present an approach for analysing and extracting pertinent knowledge from published studies focusing on the cellular toxicity of cadmium-containing semiconductor quantum dots. From 307 publications, we obtain 1,741 cell viability-related data samples, each with 24 qualitative and quantitative attributes describing the material properties and experimental conditions. Using random forest regression models to analyse the data, we show that toxicity is closely correlated with quantum dot surface properties (including shell, ligand and surface modifications), diameter, assay type and exposure time. Our approach of integrating quantitative and categorical data provides a roadmap for interrogating the wide-ranging toxicity data in the literature and suggests that meta-analysis can help develop methods for predicting the toxicity of engineered nanomaterials.</p>",[],False,"[""Eunkeu Oh"", ""Rong Liu"", ""Andre Nel"", ""Kelly Boeneman Gemill"", ""Muhammad Bilal"", ""Yoram Cohen"", ""Igor L.
