letter,Intraoperative diagnostics and elimination of residual microtumours with plasmonic nanobubbles,"<p>Failure of cancer surgery to intraoperatively detect and eliminate microscopic residual disease (MRD) causes lethal recurrence and metastases, and the removal of important normal tissues causes excessive morbidity. Here, we show that a plasmonic nanobubble (PNB), a non-stationary laser pulse-activated nanoevent, intraoperatively detects and eliminates MRD in the surgical bed. PNBs were generated in vivo in head and neck cancer cells by systemically targeting tumours with gold colloids and locally applying near-infrared, low-energy short laser pulses, and were simultaneously detected with an acoustic probe. In mouse models, between 3 and 30 residual cancer cells and MRD (undetectable with current methods) were non-invasively detected up to 4&#8197;mm deep in the surgical bed within 1&#8197;ms. In resectable MRD, PNB-guided surgery prevented local recurrence and delivered 100% tumour-free survival. In unresectable MRD, PNB nanosurgery improved survival twofold compared with standard surgery. Our results show that PNB-guided surgery and nanosurgery can rapidly and precisely detect and remove MRD in simple intraoperative procedures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of BioSciences at Rice, Rice University, Houston, 77005, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Ekaterina Y.

article,A quantum phase switch between a single solid-state spin and a photon,"<p>Interactions between single spins and photons are essential for quantum networks and distributed quantum computation. Achieving spin&#8211;photon interactions in a solid-state device could enable compact chip-integrated quantum circuits operating at gigahertz bandwidths. Many theoretical works have suggested using spins embedded in nanophotonic structures to attain this high-speed interface. These proposals implement a quantum switch where the spin flips the state of the photon and a photon flips the spin state. However, such a switch has not yet been realized using a solid-state spin system. Here, we report an experimental realization of a spin&#8211;photon quantum switch using a single solid-state spin embedded in a nanophotonic cavity. We show that the spin state strongly modulates the polarization of a reflected photon, and a single reflected photon coherently rotates the spin state. These strong spin&#8211;photon interactions open up a promising direction for solid-state implementations of high-speed quantum networks and on-chip quantum information processors using nanophotonic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics, Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742, Maryland, USA', 'authors': ['Shuo Sun', ',\xa0Hyochul Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Edo Waks']}, {'address': 'Joint Quantum Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Maryland, Gaithersburg, 20899, Maryland, USA', 'authors': ['Glenn S.

article,Nanopatterning reconfigurable magnetic landscapes via thermally assisted scanning probe lithography,"<p>The search for novel tools to control magnetism at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of new paradigms in optics, electronics and spintronics. So far, the fabrication of magnetic nanostructures has been achieved mainly through irreversible structural or chemical modifications. Here, we propose a new concept for creating reconfigurable magnetic nanopatterns by crafting, at the nanoscale, the magnetic anisotropy landscape of a ferromagnetic layer exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnetic layer. By performing localized field cooling with the hot tip of a scanning probe microscope, magnetic structures, with arbitrarily oriented magnetization and tunable unidirectional anisotropy, are reversibly patterned without modifying the film chemistry and topography. This opens unforeseen possibilities for the development of novel metamaterials with finely tuned magnetic properties, such as reconfigurable magneto-plasmonic and magnonic crystals. In this context, we experimentally demonstrate spatially controlled spin wave excitation and propagation in magnetic structures patterned with the proposed method.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, 20133, Italy', 'authors': ['E.

article,Frequency fluctuations in silicon nanoresonators,"<p>Frequency stability is key to the performance of nanoresonators. This stability is thought to reach a limit with the resonator's ability to resolve thermally induced vibrations. Although measurements and predictions of resonator stability usually disregard fluctuations in the mechanical frequency response, these fluctuations have recently attracted considerable theoretical interest. However, their existence is very difficult to demonstrate experimentally. Here, through a literature review, we show that all studies of frequency stability report values several orders of magnitude larger than the limit imposed by thermomechanical noise. We studied a monocrystalline silicon nanoresonator at room temperature and found a similar discrepancy. We propose a new method to show that this was due to the presence of frequency fluctuations, of unexpected level. The fluctuations were not due to the instrumentation system, or to any other of the known sources investigated.

article,Physically unclonable cryptographic primitives using self-assembled carbon nanotubes,"<p>Information security underpins many aspects of modern society. However, silicon chips are vulnerable to hazards such as counterfeiting, tampering and information leakage through side-channel attacks (for example, by measuring power consumption, timing or electromagnetic radiation). Single-walled carbon nanotubes are a potential replacement for silicon as the channel material of transistors due to their superb electrical properties and intrinsic ultrathin body, but problems such as limited semiconducting purity and non-ideal assembly still need to be addressed before they can deliver high-performance electronics. Here, we show that by using these inherent imperfections, an unclonable electronic random structure can be constructed at low cost from carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes are self-assembled into patterned HfO<sub>2</sub> trenches using ion-exchange chemistry, and the width of the trench is optimized to maximize the randomness of the nanotube placement. With this approach, two-dimensional (2D) random bit arrays are created that can offer ternary-bit architecture by determining the connection yield and switching type of the nanotube devices. As a result, our cryptographic keys provide a significantly higher level of security than conventional binary-bit architecture with the same key size.</p>",,"[{'address': 'College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Albany, Albany, 12203, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Zhaoying Hu', '\xa0&\xa0Michael Liehr']}, {'address': 'IBM T.

article,A graphene-based electrochemical device with thermoresponsive microneedles for diabetes monitoring and therapy,"<p>Owing to its high carrier mobility, conductivity, flexibility and optical transparency, graphene is a versatile material in micro- and macroelectronics. However, the low density of electrochemically active defects in graphene synthesized by chemical vapour deposition limits its application in biosensing. Here, we show that graphene doped with gold and combined with a gold mesh has improved electrochemical activity over bare graphene, sufficient to form a wearable patch for sweat-based diabetes monitoring and feedback therapy. The stretchable device features a serpentine bilayer of gold mesh and gold-doped graphene that forms an efficient electrochemical interface for the stable transfer of electrical signals. The patch consists of a heater, temperature, humidity, glucose and pH sensors and polymeric microneedles that can be thermally activated to deliver drugs transcutaneously. We show that the patch can be thermally actuated to deliver Metformin and reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic mice.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Nanoparticle Research, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Seoul, 151-742, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Hyunjae Lee', ',\xa0Tae Kyu Choi', ',\xa0Young Bum Lee', ',\xa0Hye Rim Cho', ',\xa0Taeghwan Hyeon', ',\xa0Seung Hong Choi', '\xa0&\xa0Dae-Hyeong Kim']}, {'address': 'School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Chemical Processes, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-742, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Hyunjae Lee', ',\xa0Tae Kyu Choi', ',\xa0Young Bum Lee', ',\xa0Taeghwan Hyeon', '\xa0&\xa0Dae-Hyeong Kim']}, {'address': 'Department of Radiology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 110-744, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Hye Rim Cho', '\xa0&\xa0Seung Hong Choi']}, {'address': 'MC10, 10 Maguire Rd., Lexington, 02140, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Roozbeh Ghaffari']}, {'address': 'Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Center for Mechanics of Solids, Structures and Materials, Texas Materials Institute, University of Texas at Austin, 210 E 24th Street, Austin, 78712, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Liu Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Nanshu Lu']}, {'address': 'Department of Anatomy, Neuroscience Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 110-744, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Hyung Jin Choi']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-747, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Taek Dong Chung']}, {'address': 'Advanced Institutes of Convergence Technology, Gyeonggi-do, 443-270, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Taek Dong Chung']}]",False,"['Hyunjae Lee', 'Tae Kyu Choi', 'Young Bum Lee', 'Hye Rim Cho', 'Roozbeh Ghaffari', 'Liu Wang', 'Hyung Jin Choi', 'Taek Dong Chung', 'Nanshu Lu', 'Taeghwan Hyeon', 'Seung Hong Choi', 'Dae-Hyeong Kim']","Lee, H., Choi, T., Lee, Y. et al.A graphene-based electrochemical device with thermoresponsive microneedles for diabetes monitoring and therapy.
