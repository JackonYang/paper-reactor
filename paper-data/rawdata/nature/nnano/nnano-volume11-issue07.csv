article,A spin–orbit torque switching scheme with collinear magnetic easy axis and current configuration,"<p>Spin&#8211;orbit torque, a torque brought about by in-plane current via the spin&#8211;orbit interactions in heavy-metal/ferromagnet nanostructures, provides a new pathway to switch the magnetization direction. Although there are many recent studies, they all build on one of two structures that have the easy axis of a nanomagnet lying orthogonal to the current, that is, along the z or y axes. Here, we present a new structure with the third geometry, that is, with the easy axis collinear with the current (along the x axis). We fabricate a three-terminal device with a Ta/CoFeB/MgO-based stack and demonstrate the switching operation driven by the spin&#8211;orbit torque due to Ta with a negative spin Hall angle. Comparisons with different geometries highlight the previously unknown mechanisms of spin&#8211;orbit torque switching.

article,Layered reduced graphene oxide with nanoscale interlayer gaps as a stable host for lithium metal anodes,"<p>Metallic lithium is a promising anode candidate for future high-energy-density lithium batteries. It is a light-weight material, and has the highest theoretical capacity (3,860&#8197;mAh&#8197;g<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) and the lowest electrochemical potential of all candidates. There are, however, at least three major hurdles before lithium metal anodes can become a viable technology: uneven and dendritic lithium deposition, unstable solid electrolyte interphase and almost infinite relative dimension change during cycling. Previous research has tackled the first two issues, but the last is still mostly unsolved. Here we report a composite lithium metal anode that exhibits low dimension variation (&#8764;20%) during cycling and good mechanical flexibility. The anode is composed of 7&#8197;wt% &#8216;lithiophilic&#8217; layered reduced graphene oxide with nanoscale gaps that can host metallic lithium. The anode retains up to &#8764;3,390&#8197;mAh&#8197;g<sup>&#8211;1</sup> of capacity, exhibits low overpotential (&#8764;80&#8197;mV at 3&#8197;mA&#8197;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup>) and a flat voltage profile in a carbonate electrolyte.

article,Wafer-scale monodomain films of spontaneously aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>The one-dimensional character of electrons, phonons and excitons in individual single-walled carbon nanotubes leads to extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal and optical properties. However, despite significant efforts to develop ways to produce large-scale architectures of aligned nanotubes, macroscopic manifestations of such properties remain limited. Here, we show that large (&gt;cm<sup>2</sup>) monodomain films of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes can be prepared using slow vacuum filtration. The produced films are globally aligned within &#177;1.5&#176; (a nematic order parameter of &#8764;1) and are highly packed, containing 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>6</sup> nanotubes in a cross-sectional area of 1&#8197;&#956;m<sup>2</sup>. The method works for nanotubes synthesized by various methods, and film thickness is controllable from a few nanometres to &#8764;100&#8197;nm. We use the approach to create ideal polarizers in the terahertz frequency range and, by combining the method with recently developed sorting techniques, highly aligned and chirality-enriched nanotube thin-film devices. Semiconductor-enriched devices exhibit polarized light emission and polarization-dependent photocurrent, as well as anisotropic conductivities and transistor action with high on/off ratios.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, 77005, Texas, USA', 'authors': ['Xiaowei He', ',\xa0Weilu Gao', ',\xa0Qi Zhang', ',\xa0John M.

article,Ultrafast proton transport in sub-1-nm diameter carbon nanotube porins,"<p>Proton transport plays an important role in many biological processes due to the ability of protons to rapidly translocate along chains of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations have predicted that confinement in hydrophobic nanochannels should enhance the rate of proton transport. Here, we show that 0.8-nm-diameter carbon nanotube porins, which promote the formation of one-dimensional water wires, can support proton transport rates exceeding those of bulk water by an order of magnitude. The transport rates in these narrow nanotube pores also exceed those of biological channels and Nafion. With larger 1.5-nm-diameter nanotube porins, proton transport rates comparable to bulk water are observed. We also show that the proton conductance of these channels can be modulated by the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. Our results illustrate the potential of small-diameter carbon nanotube porins as a proton conductor material and suggest that strong spatial confinement is a key factor in enabling efficient proton transport.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Biosciences and Biotechnology Division, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Avenue, Livermore, 94550, California, USA', 'authors': ['Ramya H.

article,"Digitally encoded DNA nanostructures for multiplexed, single-molecule protein sensing with nanopores","<p>The simultaneous detection of a large number of different analytes is important in bionanotechnology research and in diagnostic applications. Nanopore sensing is an attractive method in this regard as the approach can be integrated into small, portable device architectures, and there is significant potential for detecting multiple sub-populations in a sample. Here, we show that highly multiplexed sensing of single molecules can be achieved with solid-state nanopores by using digitally encoded DNA nanostructures. Based on the principles of DNA origami, we designed a library of DNA nanostructures in which each member contains a unique barcode; each bit in the barcode is signalled by the presence or absence of multiple DNA dumbbell hairpins. We show that a 3-bit barcode can be assigned with 94% accuracy by electrophoretically driving the DNA structures through a solid-state nanopore. Select members of the library were then functionalized to detect a single, specific antibody through antigen presentation at designed positions on the DNA. This allows us to simultaneously detect four different antibodies of the same isotype at nanomolar concentration levels.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, JJ Thomson Avenue, Cambridge, CB3 0HE, UK', 'authors': ['Nicholas A.
