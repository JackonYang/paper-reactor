article,Stochastic phase-change neurons,"<p>Artificial neuromorphic systems based on populations of spiking neurons are an indispensable tool in understanding the human brain and in constructing neuromimetic computational systems. To reach areal and power efficiencies comparable to those seen in biological systems, electroionics-based and phase-change-based memristive devices have been explored as nanoscale counterparts of synapses. However, progress on scalable realizations of neurons has so far been limited. Here, we show that chalcogenide-based phase-change materials can be used to create an artificial neuron in which the membrane potential is represented by the phase configuration of the nanoscale phase-change device. By exploiting the physics of reversible amorphous-to-crystal phase transitions, we show that the temporal integration of postsynaptic potentials can be achieved on a nanosecond timescale. Moreover, we show that this is inherently stochastic because of the melt-quench-induced reconfiguration of the atomic structure occurring when the neuron is reset. We demonstrate the use of these phase-change neurons, and their populations, in the detection of temporal correlations in parallel data streams and in sub-Nyquist representation of high-bandwidth signals.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Research-Zurich, Rüschlikon, CH-8803, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Tomas Tuma', ',\xa0Angeliki Pantazi', ',\xa0Manuel Le Gallo', ',\xa0Abu Sebastian', '\xa0&\xa0Evangelos Eleftheriou']}, {'address': 'ETH Zurich, Zurich, CH-8092, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Manuel Le Gallo']}]",False,"['Tomas Tuma', 'Angeliki Pantazi', 'Manuel Le Gallo', 'Abu Sebastian', 'Evangelos Eleftheriou']","Tuma, T., Pantazi, A., Le Gallo, M. et al.

article,Scanned probe imaging of nanoscale magnetism at cryogenic temperatures with a single-spin quantum sensor,"<p>High-spatial-resolution magnetic imaging has driven important developments in fields ranging from materials science to biology. However, to uncover finer details approaching the nanoscale with greater sensitivity requires the development of a radically new sensor technology. The nitrogen&#8211;vacancy (NV) defect in diamond has emerged as a promising candidate for such a sensor on the basis of its atomic size and quantum-limited sensing capabilities. It has remained an outstanding challenge to implement the NV centre as a nanoscale scanning magnetic probe at cryogenic temperatures, however, where many solid-state systems exhibit non-trivial magnetic order. Here, we present NV magnetic imaging down to 6&#8197;K with 3&#8197;&#956;T&#8197;Hz<sup>&#8211;1/2</sup> field sensitivity, and use the technique to image vortices in the iron pnictide superconductor BaFe<sub>2</sub>(As<sub>0.7</sub>P<sub>0.3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> with critical temperature T<sub>c</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;30&#8197;K.

article,Simultaneous and coordinated rotational switching of all molecular rotors in a network,"<p>A range of artificial molecular systems has been created that can exhibit controlled linear and rotational motion. In the further development of such systems, a key step is the addition of communication between molecules in a network. Here, we show that a two-dimensional array of dipolar molecular rotors can undergo simultaneous rotational switching when applying an electric field from the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. Several hundred rotors made from porphyrin-based double-decker complexes can be simultaneously rotated when in a hexagonal rotor network on a Cu(111) surface by applying biases above 1&#8197;V at 80&#8197;K. The phenomenon is observed only in a hexagonal rotor network due to the degeneracy of the ground-state dipole rotational energy barrier of the system. Defects are essential to increase electric torque on the rotor network and to stabilize the switched rotor domains. At low biases and low initial rotator angles, slight reorientations of individual rotors can occur, resulting in the rotator arms pointing in different directions. Analysis reveals that the rotator arm directions are not random, but are coordinated to minimize energy via crosstalk among the rotors through dipolar interactions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics and Astronomy Department, Nanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute, Ohio University, Athens, 45701, Ohio, USA', 'authors': ['Y.

article,Discrimination of oligonucleotides of different lengths with a wild-type aerolysin nanopore,"<p>Protein nanopores offer an inexpensive, label-free method of analysing single oligonucleotides. The sensitivity of the approach is largely determined by the characteristics of the pore-forming protein employed, and typically relies on nanopores that have been chemically modified or incorporate molecular motors. Effective, high-resolution discrimination of oligonucleotides using wild-type biological nanopores remains difficult to achieve. Here, we show that a wild-type aerolysin nanopore can resolve individual short oligonucleotides that are 2 to 10 bases long. The sensing capabilities are attributed to the geometry of aerolysin and the electrostatic interactions between the nanopore and the oligonucleotides. We also show that the wild-type aerolysin nanopores can distinguish individual oligonucleotides from mixtures and can monitor the stepwise cleavage of oligonucleotides by exonuclease&#160;I.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials & Department of Chemistry, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, China', 'authors': ['Chan Cao', ',\xa0Yi-Lun Ying', ',\xa0Zheng-Li Hu', ',\xa0Dong-Fang Liao', ',\xa0He Tian', '\xa0&\xa0Yi-Tao Long']}]",False,"['Chan Cao', 'Yi-Lun Ying', 'Zheng-Li Hu', 'Dong-Fang Liao', 'He Tian', 'Yi-Tao Long']","Cao, C., Ying, Y., Hu, Z. et al.

article,Spatiotemporal dynamics of the nuclear pore complex transport barrier resolved by high-speed atomic force microscopy,"<p>Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are biological nanomachines that mediate the bidirectional traffic of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and nucleus in eukaryotic cells. This process involves numerous intrinsically disordered, barrier-forming proteins known as phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups) that are tethered inside each pore. The selective barrier mechanism has so far remained unresolved because the FG Nups have eluded direct structural analysis within NPCs. Here, high-speed atomic force microscopy is used to visualize the nanoscopic spatiotemporal dynamics of FG Nups inside Xenopus&#8197;laevis oocyte NPCs at timescales of &#8764;100&#8197;ms. Our results show that the cytoplasmic orifice is circumscribed by highly flexible, dynamically fluctuating FG Nups that rapidly elongate and retract, consistent with the diffusive motion of tethered polypeptide chains. On this basis, intermingling FG Nups exhibit transient entanglements in the central channel, but do not cohere into a tightly crosslinked meshwork. Therefore, the basic functional form of the NPC barrier is comprised of highly dynamic FG Nups that manifest as a central plug or transporter when averaged in space and time.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Biozentrum and the Swiss Nanoscience Institute, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 70, Basel, CH-4056, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Yusuke Sakiyama', ',\xa0Larisa E.

article,A pH-activatable nanoparticle with signal-amplification capabilities for non-invasive imaging of tumour malignancy,"<p>Engineered nanoparticles that respond to pathophysiological parameters, such as pH or redox potential, have been developed as contrast agents for the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of tumours. However, beyond anatomic assessment, contrast agents that can sense these pathological parameters and rapidly amplify their magnetic resonance signals are desirable because they could potentially be used to monitor the biological processes of tumours and improve cancer diagnosis. Here, we report an MRI contrast agent that rapidly amplifies magnetic resonance signals in response to pH. We confined Mn<sup>2+</sup> within pH-sensitive calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles comprising a poly(ethylene glycol) shell. At a low pH, such as in solid tumours, the CaP disintegrates and releases Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions. Binding to proteins increases the relaxivity of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and enhances the contrast. We show that these nanoparticles could rapidly and selectively brighten solid tumours, identify hypoxic regions within the tumour mass and detect invisible millimetre-sized metastatic tumours in the liver.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory for Chemistry and Life Science, Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology, R1-11, 4259 Nagatsuta, Midori-ku, 226-8503, Yokohama, Japan', 'authors': ['Peng Mi', '\xa0&\xa0Nobuhiro Nishiyama']}, {'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8656, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['Peng Mi', ',\xa0Horacio Cabral', ',\xa0Hailiang Wu', '\xa0&\xa0Kazunori Kataoka']}, {'address': 'Innovation Center of Nanomedicine (iCONM), Kawasaki Institute of Industry Promotion, 3-25-14 Tonomachi, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki, 210-0821, Japan', 'authors': ['Peng Mi', ',\xa0Nobuhiro Nishiyama', '\xa0&\xa0Kazunori Kataoka']}, {'address': 'National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Japan Agency for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Anagawa 4-9-1, Inage, Chiba, 263-8555, Japan', 'authors': ['Daisuke Kokuryo', ',\xa0Tsuneo Saga', '\xa0&\xa0Ichio Aoki']}, {'address': 'SPring 8, JASRI, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, 679-5198, Hyogo, Japan', 'authors': ['Yasuko Terada']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8656, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['Kazunori Kataoka']}, {'address': 'Center for Disease Biology and Integrative Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-0033, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['Kazunori Kataoka']}]",False,"['Peng Mi', 'Daisuke Kokuryo', 'Horacio Cabral', 'Hailiang Wu', 'Yasuko Terada', 'Tsuneo Saga', 'Ichio Aoki', 'Nobuhiro Nishiyama', 'Kazunori Kataoka']","Mi, P., Kokuryo, D., Cabral, H. et al.A pH-activatable nanoparticle with signal-amplification capabilities for non-invasive imaging of tumour malignancy.
