article,Spatial metrology of dopants in silicon with exact lattice site precision,"<p>Scaling of Si-based nanoelectronics has reached the regime where device function is affected not only by the presence of individual dopants, but also by their positions in the crystal. Determination of the precise dopant location is an unsolved problem in applications from channel doping in ultrascaled transistors to quantum information processing. Here, we establish a metrology combining low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging and a comprehensive quantum treatment of the dopant&#8211;STM system to pinpoint the exact coordinates of the dopant in the Si crystal. The technique is underpinned by the observation that STM images contain atomic-sized features in ordered patterns that are highly sensitive to the STM tip orbital and the absolute dopant lattice site. The demonstrated ability to determine the locations of P and As dopants to 5&#8197;nm depths will provide critical information for the design and optimization of nanoscale devices for classical and quantum computing applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, 3010, Victoria, Australia', 'authors': ['M.

article,Flexible non-volatile optical memory thin-film transistor device with over 256 distinct levels based on an organic bicomponent blend,"<p>Organic nanomaterials are attracting a great deal of interest for use in flexible electronic applications such as logic circuits, displays and solar cells. These technologies have already demonstrated good performances, but flexible organic memories are yet to deliver on all their promise in terms of volatility, operational voltage, write/erase speed, as well as the number of distinct attainable levels. Here, we report a multilevel non-volatile flexible optical memory thin-film transistor based on a blend of a reference polymer semiconductor, namely poly(3-hexylthiophene), and a photochromic diarylethene, switched with ultraviolet and green light irradiation. A three-terminal device featuring over 256 (8&#8197;bit storage) distinct current levels was fabricated, the memory states of which could be switched with 3&#8197;ns laser pulses. We also report robustness over 70 write&#8211;erase cycles and non-volatility exceeding 500&#8197;days. The device was implemented on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate, validating the concept for integration into wearable electronics and smart nanodevices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ISIS & icFRC, University of Strasbourg & CNRS, 8 allée Gaspard Monge, Strasbourg, 67000, France', 'authors': ['Tim Leydecker', ',\xa0Emanuele Orgiu', '\xa0&\xa0Paolo Samorì']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry & IRIS Adlershof, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Brook-Taylor-Straße 2, Berlin, 12489, Germany', 'authors': ['Martin Herder', '\xa0&\xa0Stefan Hecht']}, {'address': 'Laboratory for Organic Matter Physics, University of Nova Gorica, Vipavska 13, Nova Gorica, SI-5000, Slovenia', 'authors': ['Egon Pavlica', '\xa0&\xa0Gvido Bratina']}]",False,"['Tim Leydecker', 'Martin Herder', 'Egon Pavlica', 'Gvido Bratina', 'Stefan Hecht', 'Emanuele Orgiu', 'Paolo Samorì']","Leydecker, T., Herder, M., Pavlica, E. et al.

article,Three-dimensional mapping and regulation of action potential propagation in nanoelectronics-innervated tissues,"<p>Real-time mapping and manipulation of electrophysiology in three-dimensional (3D) tissues could have important impacts on fundamental scientific and clinical studies, yet realization is hampered by a lack of effective methods. Here we introduce tissue-scaffold-mimicking 3D nanoelectronic arrays consisting of 64 addressable devices with subcellular dimensions and a submillisecond temporal resolution. Real-time extracellular action potential (AP) recordings reveal quantitative maps of AP propagation in 3D cardiac tissues, enable in situ tracing of the evolving topology of 3D conducting pathways in developing cardiac tissues and probe the dynamics of AP conduction characteristics in a transient arrhythmia disease model and subsequent tissue self-adaptation. We further demonstrate simultaneous multisite stimulation and mapping to actively manipulate the frequency and direction of AP propagation.

article,High-speed atomic force microscopy shows that annexin V stabilizes membranes on the second timescale,"<p>Annexins are abundant cytoplasmic proteins that can bind to negatively charged phospholipids in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, and are known to play a role in the storage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and membrane healing. Little is known, however, about the dynamic processes of protein&#8211;Ca<sup>2+</sup>&#8211;membrane assembly and disassembly. Here we show that high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) can be used to repeatedly induce and disrupt annexin assemblies and study their structure, dynamics and interactions. Our HS-AFM set-up is adapted for such biological applications through the integration of a pumping system for buffer exchange and a pulsed laser system for uncaging caged compounds. We find that biochemically identical annexins (annexin V) display different effective Ca<sup>2+</sup> and membrane affinities depending on the assembly location, providing a wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering regime while maintaining membrane stabilization. We also show that annexin is membrane-recruited and forms stable supramolecular assemblies within &#8764;5&#8197;s in conditions that are comparable to a membrane lesion in a cell. Molecular dynamics simulations provide atomic detail of the role played by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the reversible binding of annexin to the membrane surface.</p>",,"[{'address': 'U1006 INSERM, Université Aix-Marseille, Parc Scientifique et Technologique de Luminy, 163 avenue de Luminy, Marseille, 13009, France', 'authors': ['Atsushi Miyagi', ',\xa0Martina Rangl', '\xa0&\xa0Simon Scheuring']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire International Associé Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UMR 7565, Université de Lorraine, BP 70239, Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy cedex, 54506, France', 'authors': ['Christophe Chipot']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana−Champaign, 1110 West Green Street, Urbana, 61801, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Christophe Chipot']}]",False,"['Atsushi Miyagi', 'Christophe Chipot', 'Martina Rangl', 'Simon Scheuring']","Miyagi, A., Chipot, C., Rangl, M. et al.

article,Anomalous water expulsion from carbon-based rods at high humidity,"<p>Three water adsorption&#8211;desorption mechanisms are common in inorganic materials: chemisorption, which can lead to the modification of the first coordination sphere; simple adsorption, which is reversible; and condensation, which is irreversible. Regardless of the sorption mechanism, all known materials exhibit an isotherm in which the quantity of water adsorbed increases with an increase in relative humidity. Here, we show that carbon-based rods can adsorb water at low humidity and spontaneously expel about half of the adsorbed water when the relative humidity exceeds a 50&#8211;80% threshold. The water expulsion is reversible, and is attributed to the interfacial forces between the confined rod surfaces. At wide rod spacings, a monolayer of water can form on the surface of the carbon-based rods, which subsequently leads to condensation in the confined space between adjacent rods. As the relative humidity increases, adjacent rods (confining surfaces) in the bundles are drawn closer together via capillary forces. At high relative humidity, and once the size of the confining surfaces has decreased to a critical length, a surface-induced evaporation phenomenon known as solvent cavitation occurs and water that had condensed inside the confined area is released as a vapour.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Energy & Environment Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, 99354, Washington, USA', 'authors': ['Satish K.

article,Optical imaging of individual biomolecules in densely packed clusters,"<p>Recent advances in fluorescence super-resolution microscopy have allowed subcellular features and synthetic nanostructures down to 10&#8211;20 nm in size to be imaged. However, the direct optical observation of individual molecular targets (&#8764;5&#8197;nm) in a densely packed biomolecular cluster remains a challenge. Here, we show that such discrete molecular imaging is possible using DNA-PAINT (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography)&#8212;a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique that exploits programmable transient oligonucleotide hybridization&#8212;on synthetic DNA nanostructures. We examined the effects of a high photon count, high blinking statistics and an appropriate blinking duty cycle on imaging quality, and developed a software-based drift correction method that achieves &lt;1&#8197;nm residual drift (root mean squared) over hours. This allowed us to image a densely packed triangular lattice pattern with &#8764;5&#8197;nm point-to-point distance and to analyse the DNA origami structural offset with &#229;ngstr&#246;m-level precision (2&#8197;&#197;) from single-molecule studies.

article,Metal nanoparticles in the presence of lipopolysaccharides trigger the onset of metal allergy in mice,"<p>Many people suffer from metal allergy, and the recently demonstrated presence of naturally occurring metal nanoparticles in our environment could present a new candidate for inducing metal allergy. Here, we show that mice pretreated with silver nanoparticles (nAg) and lipopolysaccharides, but not with the silver ions that are thought to cause allergies, developed allergic inflammation in response to the silver. nAg-induced acquired immune responses depended on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and elicited IL-17A-mediated inflammation, similar to that observed in human metal allergy. Nickel nanoparticles also caused sensitization in the mice, whereas gold and silica nanoparticles, which are minimally ionizable, did not. Quantitative analysis of the silver distribution suggested that small nAg (&#8804;10&#8197;nm) transferred to the draining lymph node and released ions more readily than large nAg (&gt;10&#8197;nm). These results suggest that metal nanoparticles served as ion carriers to enable metal sensitization.

article,Measuring protein isoelectric points by AFM-based force spectroscopy using trace amounts of sample,"<p>Protein charge at various pH and isoelectric point (pI) values is important in understanding protein function. However, often only trace amounts of unknown proteins are available and pI measurements cannot be obtained using conventional methods. Here, we show a method based on the atomic force microscope (AFM) to determine pI using minute quantities of proteins. The protein of interest is immobilized on AFM colloidal probes and the adhesion force of the protein is measured against a positively and a negatively charged substrate made by layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes. From the AFM force&#8211;distance curves, pI values with an estimated accuracy of &#177;0.25 were obtained for bovine serum albumin, myoglobin, fibrinogen and ribonuclease A over a range of 4.7&#8211;9.8. Using this method, we show that the pI of the &#8216;footprint&#8217; of the temporary adhesive proteins secreted by the barnacle cyprid larvae of Amphibalanus amphitrite is in the range 9.6&#8211;9.7.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), 2 Fusionopolis Way, Innovis, No. 08–03, Singapore, 138634, Singapore', 'authors': ['Shifeng Guo', ',\xa0Xiaoying Zhu', ',\xa0Dominik Jańczewski', '\xa0&\xa0Tao He']}, {'address': 'Laboratory of Technological Processes, Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Noakowskiego 3, Warsaw, 00-664, Poland', 'authors': ['Dominik Jańczewski']}, {'address': 'Tropical Marine Science Institute, National University of Singapore, 18 Kent Ridge Road, 119227, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Serina Siew Chen Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Serena Lay Ming Teo']}, {'address': 'Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences A*STAR, 1 Pesek Road, Jurong Island, 627833, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['G.
