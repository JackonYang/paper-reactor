article,Magnetic vortex cores as tunable spin-wave emitters,"<p>The use of spin waves as information carriers in spintronic devices can substantially reduce energy losses by eliminating the ohmic heating associated with electron transport. Yet, the excitation of short-wavelength spin waves in nanoscale magnetic systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a method for their coherent generation in a heterostructure composed of antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic layers. The driven dynamics of naturally formed nanosized stacked pairs of magnetic vortex cores is used to achieve this aim. The resulting spin-wave propagation is directly imaged by time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. We show that the dipole-exchange spin waves excited in this system have a linear, non-reciprocal dispersion and that their wavelength can be tuned by changing the driving frequency.</p>",[],False,"[""Sebastian Wintz"", ""Vasil Tiberkevich"", ""Markus Weigand"", ""J\u00f6rg Raabe"", ""J\u00fcrgen Lindner"", ""Artur Erbe"", ""Andrei Slavin"", ""J\u00fcrgen Fassbender""]","Wintz, S., Tiberkevich, V., Weigand, M. et al.

article,Large-scale chemical assembly of atomically thin transistors and circuits,"<p>Next-generation electronics calls for new materials beyond silicon, aiming at increased functionality, performance and scaling in integrated circuits. In this respect, two-dimensional gapless graphene and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides have emerged as promising candidates due to their atomic thickness and chemical stability. However, difficulties with precise spatial control during their assembly currently impede actual integration into devices. Here, we report on the large-scale, spatially controlled synthesis of heterostructures made of single-layer semiconducting molybdenum disulfide contacting conductive graphene. Transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that the single-layer molybdenum disulfide nucleates at the graphene edges. We demonstrate that such chemically assembled atomic transistors exhibit high transconductance (10&#8197;&#181;S), on&#8211;off ratio (&#8764;10<sup>6</sup>) and mobility (&#8764;17&#8197;cm<sup>2</sup>&#8197;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). The precise site selectivity from atomically thin conducting and semiconducting crystals enables us to exploit these heterostructures to assemble two-dimensional logic circuits, such as an NMOS inverter with high voltage gain (up to 70).</p>",[],False,"[""Mervin Zhao"", ""Yu Ye"", ""Yimo Han"", ""Yang Xia"", ""Hanyu Zhu"", ""Siqi Wang"", ""Yuan Wang"", ""David A.

article,Dynamic peptide libraries for the discovery of supramolecular nanomaterials,"<p>Sequence-specific polymers, such as oligonucleotides and peptides, can be used as building blocks for functional supramolecular nanomaterials. The design and selection of suitable self-assembling sequences is, however, challenging because of the vast combinatorial space available. Here we report a methodology that allows the peptide sequence space to be searched for self-assembling structures. In this approach, unprotected homo- and heterodipeptides (including aromatic, aliphatic, polar and charged amino acids) are subjected to continuous enzymatic condensation, hydrolysis and sequence exchange to create a dynamic combinatorial peptide library. The free-energy change associated with the assembly process itself gives rise to selective amplification of self-assembling candidates. By changing the environmental conditions during the selection process, different sequences and consequent nanoscale morphologies are selected.</p>",[],False,"[""Charalampos G.

article,Reading the primary structure of a protein with 0.07 nm3 resolution using a subnanometre-diameter pore,"<p>The primary structure of a protein consists of a sequence of amino acids and is a key factor in determining how a protein folds and functions. However, conventional methods for sequencing proteins, such as mass spectrometry and Edman degradation, suffer from short reads and lack sensitivity, so alternative approaches are sought. Here, we show that a subnanometre-diameter pore, sputtered through a thin silicon nitride membrane, can be used to detect the primary structure of a denatured protein molecule. When a denatured protein immersed in electrolyte is driven through the pore by an electric field, measurements of a blockade in the current reveal nearly regular fluctuations, the number of which coincides with the number of residues in the protein. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the fluctuations are highly correlated with the volumes that are occluded by quadromers (four residues) in the primary structure. Each fluctuation, therefore, represents a read of a quadromer. Scrutiny of the fluctuations reveals that the subnanometre pore is sensitive enough to read the occluded volume that is related to post-translational modifications of a single residue, measuring volume differences of &#8764;0.07&#8197;nm<sup>3</sup>, but it is not sensitive enough to discriminate between the volumes of all twenty amino acids.</p>",[],False,"[""Eamonn Kennedy"", ""Zhuxin Dong"", ""Clare Tennant"", ""Gregory Timp""]","Kennedy, E., Dong, Z., Tennant, C. et al.

article,Ultrasmall nanoparticles induce ferroptosis in nutrient-deprived cancer cells and suppress tumour growth,"<p>The design of cancer-targeting particles with precisely tuned physicochemical properties may enhance the delivery of therapeutics and access to pharmacological targets. However, a molecular-level understanding of the interactions driving the fate of nanomedicine in biological systems remains elusive. Here, we show that ultrasmall (&lt;10&#8197;nm in diameter) poly(ethylene glycol)-coated silica nanoparticles, functionalized with melanoma-targeting peptides, can induce a form of programmed cell death known as ferroptosis in starved cancer cells and cancer-bearing mice. Tumour xenografts in mice intravenously injected with nanoparticles using a high-dose multiple injection scheme exhibit reduced growth or regression, in a manner that is reversed by the pharmacological inhibitor of ferroptosis, liproxstatin-1. These data demonstrate that ferroptosis can be targeted by ultrasmall silica nanoparticles and may have therapeutic potential.</p>",[],False,"[""Sung Eun Kim"", ""Li Zhang"", ""Kai Ma"", ""Michelle Riegman"", ""Feng Chen"", ""Irina Ingold"", ""Marcus Conrad"", ""Melik Ziya Turker"", ""Minghui Gao"", ""Xuejun Jiang"", ""Sebastien Monette"", ""Mohan Pauliah"", ""Mithat Gonen"", ""Pat Zanzonico"", ""Thomas Quinn"", ""Ulrich Wiesner"", ""Michelle S.

article,Iron oxide nanoparticles inhibit tumour growth by inducing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization in tumour tissues,"<p>Until now, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved iron supplement ferumoxytol and other iron oxide nanoparticles have been used for treating iron deficiency, as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging and as drug carriers. Here, we show an intrinsic therapeutic effect of ferumoxytol on the growth of early mammary cancers, and lung cancer metastases in liver and lungs. In vitro, adenocarcinoma cells co-incubated with ferumoxytol and macrophages showed increased caspase-3 activity. Macrophages exposed to ferumoxytol displayed increased mRNA associated with pro-inflammatory Th1-type responses. In vivo, ferumoxytol significantly inhibited growth of subcutaneous adenocarcinomas in mice. In addition, intravenous ferumoxytol treatment before intravenous tumour cell challenge prevented development of liver metastasis. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and histopathology studies showed that the observed tumour growth inhibition was accompanied by increased presence of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in the tumour tissues. Our results suggest that ferumoxytol could be applied &#8216;off label&#8217; to protect the liver from metastatic seeds and potentiate macrophage-modulating cancer immunotherapies.</p>",[],False,"[""Saeid Zanganeh"", ""Gregor Hutter"", ""Ryan Spitler"", ""Olga Lenkov"", ""Morteza Mahmoudi"", ""Aubie Shaw"", ""Jukka Sakari Pajarinen"", ""Hossein Nejadnik"", ""Stuart Goodman"", ""Michael Moseley"", ""Lisa Marie Coussens"", ""Heike Elisabeth Daldrup-Link""]","Zanganeh, S., Hutter, G., Spitler, R. et al.
