article,Multiwalled nanotube faceting unravelled,"<p>Nanotubes show great promise for miniaturizing advanced technologies. Their exceptional physical properties are intimately related to their morphological and crystal structure. Circumferential faceting of multiwalled nanotubes reinforces their mechanical strength and alters their tribological and electronic properties. Here, the nature of this important phenomenon is fully rationalized in terms of interlayer registry patterns. Regardless of the nanotube identity (that is, diameter, chirality, chemical composition), faceting requires the matching of the chiral angles of adjacent layers. Above a critical diameter that corresponds well with experimental results, achiral multiwalled nanotubes display evenly spaced extended axial facets whose number equals the interlayer difference in circumferential unit cells. Elongated helical facets, commonly observed in experiment, appear in nanotubes that exhibit small interlayer chiral angle mismatch. When the wall chiralities are uncorrelated, faceting is suppressed and outer layer corrugation, which is induced by the Moir&#233; superlattice, is obtained in agreement with experiments. Finally, we offer an explanation for the higher incidence of faceting in multiwalled boron nitride nanotubes with respect to their carbon-based counterparts.</p>",[],False,"[""Itai Leven"", ""Roberto Guerra"", ""Andrea Vanossi"", ""Erio Tosatti"", ""Oded Hod""]","Leven, I., Guerra, R., Vanossi, A. et al.

article,Programmable artificial phototactic microswimmer,"<p>Phototaxis is commonly observed in motile photosynthetic microorganisms. For example, green algae are capable of swimming towards a light source (positive phototaxis) to receive more energy for photosynthesis, or away from a light source (negative phototaxis) to avoid radiation damage or to hide from predators. Recently, with the aim of applying nanoscale machinery to biomedical applications, various inorganic nanomotors based on different propulsion mechanisms have been demonstrated. The only method to control the direction of motion of these self-propelled micro/nanomotors is to incorporate a ferromagnetic material into their structure and use an external magnetic field for steering. Here, we show an artificial microswimmer that can sense and orient to the illumination direction of an external light source. Our microswimmer is a Janus nanotree containing a nanostructured photocathode and photoanode at opposite ends that release cations and anions, respectively, propelling the microswimmer by self-electrophoresis. Using chemical modifications, we can control the zeta potential of the photoanode and program the microswimmer to exhibit either positive or negative phototaxis. Finally, we show that a school of microswimmers mimics the collective phototactic behaviour of green algae in solution.</p>",[],False,"[""Baohu Dai"", ""Jizhuang Wang"", ""Ze Xiong"", ""Xiaojun Zhan"", ""Wei Dai"", ""Chien-Cheng Li"", ""Shien-Ping Feng"", ""Jinyao Tang""]","Dai, B., Wang, J., Xiong, Z. et al.

article,Direct observation of DNA knots using a solid-state nanopore,"<p>Long DNA molecules can self-entangle into knots. Experimental techniques for observing such DNA knots (primarily gel electrophoresis) are limited to bulk methods and circular molecules below 10 kilobase pairs in length. Here, we show that solid-state nanopores can be used to directly observe individual knots in both linear and circular single DNA molecules of arbitrary length. The DNA knots are observed as short spikes in the nanopore current traces of the traversing DNA molecules and their detection is dependent on a sufficiently high measurement resolution, which can be achieved using high-concentration LiCl buffers. We study the percentage of molecules with knots for DNA molecules of up to 166 kilobase pairs in length and find that the knotting occurrence rises with the length of the DNA molecule, consistent with a constant knotting probability per unit length. Our experimental data compare favourably with previous simulation-based predictions for long polymers. From the translocation time of the knot through the nanopore, we estimate that the majority of the DNA knots are tight, with remarkably small sizes below 100&#8197;nm. In the case of linear molecules, we also observe that knots are able to slide out on application of high driving forces (voltage).</p>",[],False,"[""Calin Plesa"", ""Daniel Verschueren"", ""Sergii Pud"", ""Jaco van der Torre"", ""Justus W.

article,Rapid water disinfection using vertically aligned MoS2 nanofilms and visible light,"<p>Solar energy is readily available in most climates and can be used for water purification. However, solar disinfection of drinking water mostly relies on ultraviolet light, which represents only 4% of the total solar energy, and this leads to a slow treatment speed. Therefore, the development of new materials that can harvest visible light for water disinfection, and so speed up solar water purification, is highly desirable. Here we show that few-layered vertically aligned MoS<sub>2</sub> (FLV-MoS<sub>2</sub>) films can be used to harvest the whole spectrum of visible light (&#8764;50% of solar energy) and achieve highly efficient water disinfection. The bandgap of MoS<sub>2</sub> was increased from 1.3 to 1.55&#8197;eV by decreasing the domain size, which allowed the FLV-MoS<sub>2</sub> to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for bacterial inactivation in the water. The FLV-MoS<sub>2</sub> showed a &#8764;15 times better log inactivation efficiency of the indicator bacteria compared with that of bulk MoS<sub>2</sub>, and a much faster inactivation of bacteria under both visible light and sunlight illumination compared with the widely used TiO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, by using a 5&#8197;nm copper film on top of the FLV-MoS<sub>2</sub> as a catalyst to facilitate electron&#8211;hole pair separation and promote the generation of ROS, the disinfection rate was increased a further sixfold. With our approach, we achieved water disinfection of &gt;99.999% inactivation of bacteria in 20&#8197;min with a small amount of material (1.6&#8197;mg&#8197;l<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) under simulated visible light.</p>",[],False,"[""Chong Liu"", ""Desheng Kong"", ""Po-Chun Hsu"", ""Hongtao Yuan"", ""Hyun-Wook Lee"", ""Yayuan Liu"", ""Haotian Wang"", ""Shuang Wang"", ""Kai Yan"", ""Dingchang Lin"", ""Peter A.

These superstructures are of interest to a variety of fields because of their distinct mechanical, electronic, magnetic and optical properties. Here, we establish a facile route to a diverse range of superstructures based on the polyphenol surface-functionalization of micro- and nanoparticles, nanowires, nanosheets, nanocubes and even cells. This strategy can be used to access a large number of modularly assembled superstructures, including core&#8211;satellite, hollow and hierarchically organized supraparticles. Colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations provide detailed insights into the role of surface functionalization and how this facilitates superstructure construction.

article,Quantum dot-loaded monofunctionalized DNA icosahedra for single-particle tracking of endocytic pathways,"<p>Functionalization of quantum dots (QDs) with a single biomolecular tag using traditional approaches in bulk solution has met with limited success. DNA polyhedra consist of an internal void bounded by a well-defined three-dimensional structured surface. The void can house cargo and the surface can be functionalized with stoichiometric and spatial precision. Here, we show that monofunctionalized QDs can be realized by encapsulating QDs inside DNA icosahedra and functionalizing the DNA shell with an endocytic ligand. We deployed the DNA-encapsulated QDs for real-time imaging of three different endocytic ligands&#8212;folic acid, galectin-3 (Gal3) and the Shiga toxin B-subunit (STxB). Single-particle tracking of Gal3- or STxB-functionalized QD-loaded DNA icosahedra allows us to monitor compartmental dynamics along endocytic pathways. These DNA-encapsulated QDs, which bear a unique stoichiometry of endocytic ligands, represent a new class of molecular probes for quantitative imaging of endocytic receptor dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""Dhiraj Bhatia"", ""Senthil Arumugam"", ""Michel Nasilowski"", ""Himanshu Joshi"", ""Christian Wunder"", ""Val\u00e9rie Chambon"", ""Ved Prakash"", ""Chlo\u00e9 Grazon"", ""Brice Nadal"", ""Prabal K.
