article,Magnetoelectric interaction and transport behaviours in magnetic nanocomposite thermoelectric materials,"<p>How to suppress the performance deterioration of thermoelectric materials in the intrinsic excitation region remains a key challenge. The magnetic transition of permanent magnet nanoparticles from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism provides an effective approach to finding the solution to this challenge. Here, we have designed and prepared magnetic nanocomposite thermoelectric materials consisting of BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub> nanoparticles and Ba<sub>0.3</sub>In<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>4</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub> matrix. It was found that the electrical transport behaviours of the nanocomposites are controlled by the magnetic transition of BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub> nanoparticles from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism. BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub> nanoparticles trap electrons below the Curie temperature (T<sub>C</sub>) and release the trapped electrons above the T<sub>C</sub>, playing an &#8216;electron repository&#8217; role in maintaining high figure of merit ZT. BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub> nanoparticles produce two types of magnetoelectric effect&#8212;electron spiral motion and magnon-drag thermopower&#8212;as well as enhancing phonon scattering. Our work demonstrates that the performance deterioration of thermoelectric materials in the intrinsic excitation region can be suppressed through the magnetic transition of permanent magnet nanoparticles.</p>",[],False,"[""Wenyu Zhao"", ""Zhiyuan Liu"", ""Ping Wei"", ""Qingjie Zhang"", ""Wanting Zhu"", ""Xianli Su"", ""Xinfeng Tang"", ""Jihui Yang"", ""Yong Liu"", ""Jing Shi"", ""Yimin Chao"", ""Siqi Lin"", ""Yanzhong Pei""]","Zhao, W., Liu, Z., Wei, P. et al.

article,A dressed spin qubit in silicon,"<p>Coherent dressing of a quantum two-level system provides access to a new quantum system with improved properties&#8212;a different and easily tunable level splitting, faster control and longer coherence times. In our work we investigate the properties of the dressed, donor-bound electron spin in silicon, and assess its potential as a quantum bit in scalable architectures. The two dressed spin-polariton levels constitute a quantum bit that can be coherently driven with an oscillating magnetic field, an oscillating electric field, frequency modulation of the driving field or a simple detuning pulse. We measure coherence times of  and , one order of magnitude longer than those of the undressed spin. Furthermore, the use of the dressed states enables coherent coupling of the solid-state spins to electric fields and mechanical oscillations.</p>",[],False,"[""Arne Laucht"", ""Rachpon Kalra"", ""Stephanie Simmons"", ""Juan P.

article,Measuring broadband magnetic fields on the nanoscale using a hybrid quantum register,"<p>The generation and control of fast switchable magnetic fields with large gradients on the nanoscale is of fundamental interest in material science and for a wide range of applications. However, it has not yet been possible to characterize those fields at high bandwidth with arbitrary orientations. Here, we measure the magnetic field generated by a hard-disk-drive write head with high spatial resolution and large bandwidth by coherent control of single electron and nuclear spins. We are able to derive field profiles from coherent spin Rabi oscillations close to the gigahertz range, measure magnetic field gradients on the order of 1&#8197;mT&#8197;nm<sup>&#8211;1</sup> and quantify axial and radial components of a static and dynamic magnetic field independent of its orientation.

article,Nanoscale topographical control of capillary assembly of nanoparticles,"<p>Predetermined and selective placement of nanoparticles onto large-area substrates with nanometre-scale precision is essential to harness the unique properties of nanoparticle assemblies, in particular for functional optical and electro-optical nanodevices. Unfortunately, such high spatial organization is currently beyond the reach of top-down nanofabrication techniques alone. Here, we demonstrate that topographic features comprising lithographed funnelled traps and auxiliary sidewalls on a solid substrate can deterministically direct the capillary assembly of Au nanorods to attain simultaneous control of position, orientation and interparticle distance at the nanometre level. We report up to 100% assembly yield over centimetre-scale substrates. We achieve this by optimizing the three sequential stages of capillary nanoparticle assembly: insertion of nanorods into the traps, resilience against the receding suspension front and drying of the residual solvent. Finally, using electron energy-loss spectroscopy we characterize the spectral response and near-field properties of spatially programmable Au nanorod dimers, highlighting the opportunities for precise tunability of the plasmonic modes in larger assemblies.</p>",[],False,"[""Valentin Flauraud"", ""Massimo Mastrangeli"", ""Gabriel D.

article,Pair correlation microscopy reveals the role of nanoparticle shape in intracellular transport and site of drug release,"<p>Nanoparticle size, surface charge and material composition are known to affect the uptake of nanoparticles by cells. However, whether nanoparticle shape affects transport across various barriers inside the cell remains unclear. Here we used pair correlation microscopy to show that polymeric nanoparticles with different shapes but identical surface chemistries moved across the various cellular barriers at different rates, ultimately defining the site of drug release. We measured how micelles, vesicles, rods and worms entered the cell and whether they escaped from the endosomal system and had access to the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. Rods and worms, but not micelles and vesicles, entered the nucleus by passive diffusion. Improving nuclear access, for example with a nuclear localization signal, resulted in more doxorubicin release inside the nucleus and correlated with greater cytotoxicity. Our results therefore demonstrate that drug delivery across the major cellular barrier, the nuclear envelope, is important for doxorubicin efficiency and can be achieved with appropriately shaped nanoparticles.</p>",[],False,"[""Elizabeth Hinde"", ""Kitiphume Thammasiraphop"", ""Hien T.
