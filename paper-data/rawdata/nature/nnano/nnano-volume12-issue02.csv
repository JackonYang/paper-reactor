article,Gapless Andreev bound states in the quantum spin Hall insulator HgTe,"<p>In recent years, Majorana physics has attracted considerable attention because of exotic new phenomena and its prospects for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. To this end, one needs to engineer the interplay between superconductivity and electronic properties in a topological insulator, but experimental work remains scarce and ambiguous. Here, we report experimental evidence for topological superconductivity induced in a HgTe quantum well, a 2D topological insulator that exhibits the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect. The a.c. Josephson effect demonstrates that the supercurrent has a 4&#960; periodicity in the superconducting phase difference, as indicated by a doubling of the voltage step for multiple Shapiro steps. In addition, this response like that of a superconducting quantum interference device to a perpendicular magnetic field shows that the 4&#960;-periodic supercurrent originates from states located on the edges of the junction. Both features appear strongest towards the QSH regime, and thus provide evidence for induced topological superconductivity in the QSH edge states.</p>",[],False,"[""Erwann Bocquillon"", ""Russell S.

article,Valley- and spin-polarized Landau levels in monolayer WSe2,"<p>Electrons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are characterized by valley and spin quantum degrees of freedom, making it possible to explore new physical phenomena and to foresee novel applications in the fields of electronics and optoelectronics. Theoretical proposals further suggest that Berry curvature effects, together with strong spin&#8211;orbit interactions, can generate unconventional Landau levels (LLs) under a perpendicular magnetic field. In particular, these would support valley- and spin-polarized chiral edge states in the quantum Hall regime. However, this unique LL structure has not been observed experimentally in transition metal dichalcogenides. Here we report the observation of fully valley- and spin-polarized LLs in high-quality WSe<sub>2</sub> monolayers achieved by exploiting a van der Waals heterostructure device platform. We applied handedness-resolved optical reflection spectroscopy to probe the inter-LL transitions at individual valleys and derived the LL structure in turn. We also measured a sizeable doping-induced mass renormalization driven by the strong Coulomb interactions.</p>",[],False,"[""Zefang Wang"", ""Jie Shan"", ""Kin Fai Mak""]","Wang, Z., Shan, J. & Mak, K.

article,Vectorial scanning force microscopy using a nanowire sensor,"<p>Self-assembled nanowire (NW) crystals can be grown into nearly defect-free nanomechanical resonators with exceptional properties, including small motional mass, high resonant frequency and low dissipation. Furthermore, by virtue of slight asymmetries in geometry, a NW's flexural modes are split into doublets oscillating along orthogonal axes. These characteristics make bottom-up grown NWs extremely sensitive vectorial force sensors. Here, taking advantage of its adaptability as a scanning probe, we use a single NW to image a sample surface. By monitoring the frequency shift and direction of oscillation of both modes as we scan above the surface, we construct a map of all spatial tip&#8211;sample force derivatives in the plane. Finally, we use the NW to image electric force fields distinguishing between forces arising from the NW charge and polarizability. This universally applicable technique enables a form of atomic force microscopy particularly suited to mapping the size and direction of weak tip&#8211;sample forces.</p>",[],False,"[""Nicola Rossi"", ""Floris R.

article,A universal and ultrasensitive vectorial nanomechanical sensor for imaging 2D force fields,"<p>The miniaturization of force probes into nanomechanical oscillators enables ultrasensitive investigations of forces on dimensions smaller than their characteristic length scales. It also unravels the vectorial character of the force field and how its topology impacts the measurement. Here we present an ultrasensitive method for imaging two-dimensional vectorial force fields by optomechanically following the bidimensional Brownian motion of a singly clamped nanowire. This approach relies on angular and spectral tomography of its quasi-frequency-degenerated transverse mechanical polarizations: immersing the nanoresonator in a vectorial force field not only shifts its eigenfrequencies but also rotates the orientation of the eigenmodes, as a nanocompass. This universal method is employed to map a tunable electrostatic force field whose spatial gradients can even dominate the intrinsic nanowire properties. Enabling vectorial force field imaging with demonstrated sensitivities of attonewton variations over the nanoprobe Brownian trajectory will have a strong impact on scientific exploration at the nanoscale.</p>",[],False,"[""Laure Mercier de L\u00e9pinay"", ""Benjamin Pigeau"", ""Benjamin Besga"", ""Pascal Vincent"", ""Philippe Poncharal"", ""Olivier Arcizet""]","de Lépinay, L., Pigeau, B., Besga, B. et al.A universal and ultrasensitive vectorial nanomechanical sensor for imaging 2D force fields.

article,Evolutionary multi-objective optimization of colour pixels based on dielectric nanoantennas,"<p>The rational design of photonic nanostructures consists of anticipating their optical response from systematic variations of simple models. This strategy, however, has limited success when multiple objectives are simultaneously targeted, because it requires demanding computational schemes. To this end, evolutionary algorithms can drive the morphology of a nano-object towards an optimum through several cycles of selection, mutation and cross-over, mimicking the process of natural selection. Here, we present a numerical technique that can allow the design of photonic nanostructures with optical properties optimized along several arbitrary objectives. In particular, we combine evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with frequency-domain electrodynamical simulations to optimize the design of colour pixels based on silicon nanostructures that resonate at two user-defined, polarization-dependent wavelengths. The scattering spectra of optimized pixels fabricated by electron-beam lithography show excellent agreement with the targeted objectives. The method is self-adaptive to arbitrary constraints and therefore particularly apt for the design of complex structures within predefined technological limits.</p>",[],False,"[""Peter R.

article,Host–guest chemistry with water-soluble gold nanoparticle supraspheres,"<p>The uptake of molecular guests, a hallmark of the supramolecular chemistry of cages and containers, has yet to be documented for soluble assemblies of metal nanoparticles. Here we demonstrate that gold nanoparticle-based supraspheres serve as a host for the hydrophobic uptake, transport and subsequent release of over two million organic guests, exceeding by five orders of magnitude the capacities of individual supramolecular cages or containers and rivalling those of zeolites and metal&#8211;organic frameworks on a mass-per-volume basis. The supraspheres are prepared in water by adding hexanethiol to polyoxometalate-protected 4&#8197;nm gold nanoparticles. Each 200&#8197;nm assembly contains hydrophobic cavities between the estimated 27,400 gold building blocks that are connected to one another by nanometre-sized pores. This gives a percolated network that effectively absorbs large numbers of molecules from water, including 600,000, 2,100,000 and 2,600,000 molecules (35, 190 and 234&#8197;g&#8197;l<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) of para-dichorobenzene, bisphenol A and trinitrotoluene, respectively.</p>",[],False,"[""Yizhan Wang"", ""Offer Zeiri"", ""Manoj Raula"", ""Benjamin Le Ouay"", ""Francesco Stellacci"", ""Ira A.

article,Nanomechanical mapping of first binding steps of a virus to animal cells,"<p>Viral infection is initiated when a virus binds to cell surface receptors. Because the cell membrane is dynamic and heterogeneous, imaging living cells and simultaneously quantifying the first viral binding events is difficult. Here, we show an atomic force and confocal microscopy set-up that allows the surface receptor landscape of cells to be imaged and the virus binding events within the first millisecond of contact with the cell to be mapped at high resolution (&lt;50&#8197;nm). We present theoretical approaches to contour the free-energy landscape of early binding events between an engineered virus and cell surface receptors. We find that the first bond formed between the viral glycoprotein and its cognate cell surface receptor has relatively low lifetime and free energy, but this increases as additional bonds form rapidly (&#8804;1&#8197;ms). The formation of additional bonds occurs with positive allosteric modulation and the three binding sites of the viral glycoprotein are quickly occupied. Our quantitative approach can be readily applied to study the binding of other viruses to animal cells.</p>",[],False,"[""David Alsteens"", ""Richard Newton"", ""Rajib Schubert"", ""David Martinez-Martin"", ""Martin Delguste"", ""Botond Roska"", ""Daniel J.
