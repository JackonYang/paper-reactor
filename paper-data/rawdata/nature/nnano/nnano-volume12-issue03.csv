review article,Reviving the lithium metal anode for high-energy batteries,"<p>Lithium-ion batteries have had a profound impact on our daily life, but inherent limitations make it difficult for Li-ion chemistries to meet the growing demands for portable electronics, electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage. Therefore, chemistries beyond Li-ion are currently being investigated and need to be made viable for commercial applications. The use of metallic Li is one of the most favoured choices for next-generation Li batteries, especially Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;air systems. After falling into oblivion for several decades because of safety concerns, metallic Li is now ready for a revival, thanks to the development of investigative tools and nanotechnology-based solutions. In this Review, we first summarize the current understanding on Li anodes, then highlight the recent key progress in materials design and advanced characterization techniques, and finally discuss the opportunities and possible directions for future development of Li anodes in applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Dingchang Lin"", ""Yayuan Liu"", ""Yi Cui""]","Lin, D., Liu, Y. & Cui, Y.

article,Multiple nanostructures based on anodized aluminium oxide templates,"<p>Several physico-chemical effects and properties in the solid state involve nanoscale interactions between adjacent materials and morphologies. Arrays of binary nanostructures can generate intimate interactions between different sub-components, but fabricating binary nanostructures is challenging. Here, we propose a concept to achieve diverse binary nanostructure arrays with high degrees of controllability for each of the sub-components, including material, dimension and morphology. This binary nanostructuring concept originates with a distinctive binary-pore anodized aluminium oxide template that includes two dissimilar sets of pores in one matrix, where the openings of the two sets of pores are towards opposite sides of the template. Using the same growth mechanism, the binary-pore template can be extended to multi-pore templates with more geometrical options. We also present photoelectrodes, transistors and plasmonic devices made with our binary nanostructure arrays using different combination of materials and morphologies, and demonstrate superior performances compared to their single-component counterparts.</p>",[],False,"[""Liaoyong Wen"", ""Rui Xu"", ""Yan Mi"", ""Yong Lei""]","Wen, L., Xu, R., Mi, Y. et al.

article,Programmable disorder in random DNA tilings,"<p>Scaling up the complexity and diversity of synthetic molecular structures will require strategies that exploit the inherent stochasticity of molecular systems in a controlled fashion. Here we demonstrate a framework for programming random DNA tilings and show how to control the properties of global patterns through simple, local rules. We constructed three general forms of planar network&#8212;random loops, mazes and trees&#8212;on the surface of self-assembled DNA origami arrays on the micrometre scale with nanometre resolution. Using simple molecular building blocks and robust experimental conditions, we demonstrate control of a wide range of properties of the random networks, including the branching rules, the growth directions, the proximity between adjacent networks and the size distribution. Much as combinatorial approaches for generating random one-dimensional chains of polymers have been used to revolutionize chemical synthesis and the selection of functional nucleic acids, our strategy extends these principles to random two-dimensional networks of molecules and creates new opportunities for fabricating more complex molecular devices that are organized by DNA nanostructures.</p>",[],False,"[""Grigory Tikhomirov"", ""Philip Petersen"", ""Lulu Qian""]","Tikhomirov, G., Petersen, P. & Qian, L.

article,Tuning membrane protein mobility by confinement into nanodomains,"<p>High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) can be used to visualize function-related conformational changes of single soluble proteins. Similar studies of single membrane proteins are, however, hampered by a lack of suitable flat, non-interacting membrane supports and by high protein mobility. Here we show that streptavidin crystals grown on mica-supported lipid bilayers can be used as porous supports for membranes containing biotinylated lipids. Using SecYEG (protein translocation channel) and GlpF (aquaglyceroporin), we demonstrate that the platform can be used to tune the lateral mobility of transmembrane proteins to any value within the dynamic range accessible to HS-AFM imaging through glutaraldehyde-cross-linking of the streptavidin. This allows HS-AFM to study the conformation or docking of spatially confined proteins, which we illustrate by imaging GlpF at sub-molecular resolution and by observing the motor protein SecA binding to SecYEG.</p>",[],False,"[""Andreas Karner"", ""Benedikt Nimmervoll"", ""Birgit Plochberger"", ""Enrico Klotzsch"", ""Andreas Horner"", ""Denis G.

article,Observation of extreme phase transition temperatures of water confined inside isolated carbon nanotubes,"<p>Fluid phase transitions inside single, isolated carbon nanotubes are predicted to deviate substantially from classical thermodynamics. This behaviour enables the study of ice nanotubes and the exploration of their potential applications. Here we report measurements of the phase boundaries of water confined within six isolated carbon nanotubes of different diameters (1.05, 1.06, 1.15, 1.24, 1.44 and 1.52&#8197;nm) using Raman spectroscopy. The results reveal an exquisite sensitivity to diameter and substantially larger temperature elevations of the freezing transition (by as much as 100&#8201;&#176;C) than have been theoretically predicted. Dynamic water filling and reversible freezing transitions were marked by 2&#8211;5&#8197;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> shifts in the radial breathing mode frequency, revealing reversible melting bracketed to 105&#8211;151&#8201;&#176;C and 87&#8211;117&#8201;&#176;C for 1.05 and 1.06&#8197;nm single-walled carbon nanotubes, respectively. Near-ambient phase changes were observed for 1.44 and 1.52&#8197;nm nanotubes, bracketed between 15&#8211;49&#8201;&#176;C and 3&#8211;30&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, whereas the depression of the freezing point was observed for the 1.15&#8197;nm nanotube between &#8722;35 and 10&#8201;&#176;C.

article,Tracking the dynamics of circulating tumour cell phenotypes using nanoparticle-mediated magnetic ranking,"<p>Profiling the heterogeneous phenotypes of rare circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in whole blood is critical to unravelling the complex and dynamic properties of these potential clinical markers. This task is challenging because these cells are present at parts per billion levels among normal blood cells. Here we report a new nanoparticle-enabled method for CTC characterization, called magnetic ranking cytometry, which profiles CTCs on the basis of their surface expression phenotype. We achieve this using a microfluidic chip that successfully processes whole blood samples. The approach classifies CTCs with single-cell resolution in accordance with their expression of phenotypic surface markers, which is read out using magnetic nanoparticles. We deploy this new technique to reveal the dynamic phenotypes of CTCs in unprocessed blood from mice as a function of tumour growth and aggressiveness.
