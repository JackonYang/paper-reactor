article,Opto-valleytronic imaging of atomically thin semiconductors,"<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors represent elementary components of layered heterostructures for emergent technologies beyond conventional optoelectronics. In their monolayer form they host electrons with quantized circular motion and associated valley polarization and valley coherence as key elements of opto-valleytronic functionality. Here, we introduce two-dimensional polarimetry as means of direct imaging of the valley pseudospin degree of freedom in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Using MoS<sub>2</sub> as a representative material with valley-selective optical transitions, we establish quantitative image analysis for polarimetric maps of extended crystals, and identify valley polarization and valley coherence as sensitive probes of crystalline disorder. Moreover, we find site-dependent thermal and non-thermal regimes of valley-polarized excitons in perpendicular magnetic fields. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of wide-field polarimetry for rapid inspection of opto-valleytronic devices based on atomically thin semiconductors and heterostructures.</p>",[],False,"[""Andre Neumann"", ""Jessica Lindlau"", ""L\u00e9o Colombier"", ""Manuel Nutz"", ""Sina Najmaei"", ""Jun Lou"", ""Aditya D.

article,Targeted intracellular voltage recordings from dendritic spines using quantum-dot-coated nanopipettes,"<p>Dendritic spines are the primary site of excitatory synaptic input onto neurons, and are biochemically isolated from the parent dendritic shaft by their thin neck. However, due to the lack of direct electrical recordings from spines, the influence that the neck resistance has on synaptic transmission, and the extent to which spines compartmentalize voltage, specifically excitatory postsynaptic potentials, albeit critical, remains controversial. Here, we use quantum-dot-coated nanopipette electrodes (tip diameters &#8764;15&#8211;30&#8197;nm) to establish the first intracellular recordings from targeted spine heads under two-photon visualization. Using simultaneous somato-spine electrical recordings, we find that back propagating action potentials fully invade spines, that excitatory postsynaptic potentials are large in the spine head (mean 26&#8197;mV) but are strongly attenuated at the soma (0.5&#8211;1&#8197;mV) and that the estimated neck resistance (mean 420&#8197;M&#937;) is large enough to generate significant voltage compartmentalization.

article,Water-based and biocompatible 2D crystal inks for all-inkjet-printed heterostructures,"<p>Exploiting the properties of two-dimensional crystals requires a mass production method able to produce heterostructures of arbitrary complexity on any substrate. Solution processing of graphene allows simple and low-cost techniques such as inkjet printing to be used for device fabrication. However, the available printable formulations are still far from ideal as they are either based on toxic solvents, have low concentration, or require time-consuming and expensive processing. In addition, none is suitable for thin-film heterostructure fabrication due to the re-mixing of different two-dimensional crystals leading to uncontrolled interfaces and poor device performance. Here, we show a general approach to achieve inkjet-printable, water-based, two-dimensional crystal formulations, which also provide optimal film formation for multi-stack fabrication. We show examples of all-inkjet-printed heterostructures, such as large-area arrays of photosensors on plastic and paper and programmable logic memory devices. Finally, in vitro dose-escalation cytotoxicity assays confirm the biocompatibility of the inks, extending their possible use to biomedical applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Daryl McManus"", ""Sandra Vranic"", ""Freddie Withers"", ""Veronica Sanchez-Romaguera"", ""Massimo Macucci"", ""Huafeng Yang"", ""Roberto Sorrentino"", ""Khaled Parvez"", ""Seok-Kyun Son"", ""Giuseppe Iannaccone"", ""Kostas Kostarelos"", ""Gianluca Fiori"", ""Cinzia Casiraghi""]","McManus, D., Vranic, S., Withers, F. et al.

article,Microscopic agents programmed by DNA circuits,"<p>Information stored in synthetic nucleic acids sequences can be used in vitro to create complex reaction networks with precisely programmed chemical dynamics. Here, we scale up this approach to program networks of microscopic particles (agents) dispersed in an enzymatic solution. Agents may possess multiple stable states, thus maintaining a memory and communicate by emitting various orthogonal chemical signals, while also sensing the behaviour of neighbouring agents. Using this approach, we can produce collective behaviours involving thousands of agents, for example retrieving information over long distances or creating spatial patterns. Our systems recapitulate some fundamental mechanisms of distributed decision making and morphogenesis among living organisms and could find applications in cases where many individual clues need to be combined to reach a decision, for example in molecular diagnostics.</p>",[],False,"[""G.

article,Real-time shape approximation and fingerprinting of single proteins using a nanopore,"<p>Established methods for characterizing proteins typically require physical or chemical modification steps or cannot be used to examine individual molecules in solution. Ionic current measurements through electrolyte-filled nanopores can characterize single native proteins in an aqueous environment, but currently offer only limited capabilities. Here we show that the zeptolitre sensing volume of bilayer-coated solid-state nanopores can be used to determine the approximate shape, volume, charge, rotational diffusion coefficient and dipole moment of individual proteins. To do this, we developed a theory for the quantitative understanding of modulations in ionic current that arise from the rotational dynamics of single proteins as they move through the electric field inside the nanopore. The approach allows us to measure the five parameters simultaneously, and we show that they can be used to identify, characterize and quantify proteins and protein complexes with potential implications for structural biology, proteomics, biomarker detection and routine protein analysis.</p>",[],False,"[""Erik C.

article,Single-molecule detection of protein efflux from microorganisms using fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotube sensor arrays,"<p>A distinct advantage of nanosensor arrays is their ability to achieve ultralow detection limits in solution by proximity placement to an analyte. Here, we demonstrate label-free detection of individual proteins from Escherichia coli (bacteria) and Pichia pastoris (yeast) immobilized in a microfluidic chamber, measuring protein efflux from single organisms in real time. The array is fabricated using non-covalent conjugation of an aptamer-anchor polynucleotide sequence to near-infrared emissive single-walled carbon nanotubes, using a variable chemical spacer shown to optimize sensor response. Unlabelled RAP1 GTPase and HIV integrase proteins were selectively detected from various cell lines, via large near-infrared fluorescent turn-on responses. We show that the process of E. coli induction, protein synthesis and protein export is highly stochastic, yielding variability in protein secretion, with E. coli cells undergoing division under starved conditions producing 66% fewer secreted protein products than their non-dividing counterparts. We further demonstrate the detection of a unique protein product resulting from T7 bacteriophage infection of E. coli, illustrating that nanosensor arrays can enable real-time, single-cell analysis of a broad range of protein products from various cell types.</p>",[],False,"[""Markita Patricia Landry"", ""Hiroki Ando"", ""Allen Y.

article,Magnesium silicide nanoparticles as a deoxygenation agent for cancer starvation therapy,"<p>A material that rapidly absorbs molecular oxygen (known as an oxygen scavenger or deoxygenation agent (DOA)) has various industrial applications, such as in food preservation, anticorrosion of metal and coal deoxidation. Given that oxygen is vital to cancer growth, to starve tumours through the consumption of intratumoral oxygen is a potentially useful strategy in fighting cancer. Here we show that an injectable polymer-modified magnesium silicide (Mg<sub>2</sub>Si) nanoparticle can act as a DOA by scavenging oxygen in tumours and form by-products that block tumour capillaries from being reoxygenated. The nanoparticles are prepared by a self-propagating high-temperature synthesis strategy. In the acidic tumour microenvironment, the Mg<sub>2</sub>Si releases silane, which efficiently reacts with both tissue-dissolved and haemoglobin-bound oxygen to form silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) aggregates. This in situ formation of SiO<sub>2</sub> blocks the tumour blood capillaries and prevents tumours from receiving new supplies of oxygen and nutrients.</p>",[],False,"[""Chen Zhang"", ""Dalong Ni"", ""Yanyan Liu"", ""Heliang Yao"", ""Wenbo Bu"", ""Jianlin Shi""]","Zhang, C., Ni, D., Liu, Y. et al.

article,Complement proteins bind to nanoparticle protein corona and undergo dynamic exchange in vivo,"<p>When nanoparticles are intravenously injected into the body, complement proteins deposit on the surface of nanoparticles in a process called opsonization. These proteins prime the particle for removal by immune cells and may contribute toward infusion-related adverse effects such as allergic responses. The ways complement proteins assemble on nanoparticles have remained unclear. Here, we show that dextran-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide core-shell nanoworms incubated in human serum and plasma are rapidly opsonized with the third complement component (C3) via the alternative pathway. Serum and plasma proteins bound to the nanoworms are mostly intercalated into the nanoworm shell. We show that C3 covalently binds to these absorbed proteins rather than the dextran shell and the protein-bound C3 undergoes dynamic exchange in vitro. Surface-bound proteins accelerate the assembly of the complement components of the alternative pathway on the nanoworm surface. When nanoworms pre-coated with human plasma were injected into mice, C3 and other adsorbed proteins undergo rapid loss. Our results provide important insight into dynamics of protein adsorption and complement opsonization of nanomedicines.</p>",[],False,"[""Fangfang Chen"", ""Guankui Wang"", ""James I.
