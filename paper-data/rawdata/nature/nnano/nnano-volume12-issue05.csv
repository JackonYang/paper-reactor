article,DNA probes for monitoring dynamic and transient molecular encounters on live cell membranes,"<p>Cells interact with the extracellular environment through molecules expressed on the membrane. Disruption of these membrane-bound interactions (or encounters) can result in disease progression. Advances in super-resolution microscopy have allowed membrane encounters to be examined, however, these methods cannot image entire membranes and cannot provide information on the dynamic interactions between membrane-bound molecules. Here, we show a novel DNA probe that can transduce transient membrane encounter events into readable cumulative fluorescence signals. The probe, which translocates from one anchor site to another, mimicking motor proteins, is realized through a toehold-mediated DNA strand displacement reaction. Using this probe, we successfully monitored rapid encounter events of membrane lipid domains using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Our results show a preference for encounters within the same lipid domains.</p>",[],False,"[""Mingxu You"", ""Yifan Lyu"", ""Da Han"", ""Liping Qiu"", ""Qiaoling Liu"", ""Tao Chen"", ""Cuichen Sam Wu"", ""Lu Peng"", ""Liqin Zhang"", ""Gang Bao"", ""Weihong Tan""]","You, M., Lyu, Y., Han, D. et al.

article,CMOS nanoelectrode array for all-electrical intracellular electrophysiological imaging,"<p>Developing a new tool capable of high-precision electrophysiological recording of a large network of electrogenic cells has long been an outstanding challenge in neurobiology and cardiology. Here, we combine nanoscale intracellular electrodes with complementary metal-oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits to realize a high-fidelity all-electrical electrophysiological imager for parallel intracellular recording at the network level. Our CMOS nanoelectrode array has 1,024 recording/stimulation &#8216;pixels&#8217; equipped with vertical nanoelectrodes, and can simultaneously record intracellular membrane potentials from hundreds of connected in vitro neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. We demonstrate that this network-level intracellular recording capability can be used to examine the effect of pharmaceuticals on the delicate dynamics of a cardiomyocyte network, thus opening up new opportunities in tissue-based pharmacological screening for cardiac and neuronal diseases as well as fundamental studies of electrogenic cells and their networks.</p>",[],False,"[""Jeffrey Abbott"", ""Tianyang Ye"", ""Ling Qin"", ""Marsela Jorgolli"", ""Rona S.

article,Real-time visualization of perforin nanopore assembly,"<p>Perforin is a key protein of the vertebrate immune system. Secreted by cytotoxic lymphocytes as soluble monomers, perforin can self-assemble into oligomeric pores of 10&#8211;20&#8197;nm inner diameter in the membranes of virus-infected and cancerous cells. These large pores facilitate the entry of pro-apoptotic granzymes, thereby rapidly killing the target cell. To elucidate the pathways of perforin pore assembly, we carried out real-time atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy studies. Our experiments reveal that the pore assembly proceeds via a membrane-bound prepore intermediate state, typically consisting of up to approximately eight loosely but irreversibly assembled monomeric subunits. These short oligomers convert to more closely packed membrane nanopore assemblies, which can subsequently recruit additional prepore oligomers to grow the pore size.</p>",[],False,"[""Carl Leung"", ""Adrian W.

article,Directed assembly of bio-inspired hierarchical materials with controlled nanofibrillar architectures,"<p>In natural systems, directed self-assembly of structural proteins produces complex, hierarchical materials that exhibit a unique combination of mechanical, chemical and transport properties. This controlled process covers dimensions ranging from the nano- to the macroscale. Such materials are desirable to synthesize integrated and adaptive materials and systems. We describe a bio-inspired process to generate hierarchically defined structures with multiscale morphology by using regenerated silk fibroin. The combination of protein self-assembly and microscale mechanical constraints is used to form oriented, porous nanofibrillar networks within predesigned macroscopic structures. This approach allows us to predefine the mechanical and physical properties of these materials, achieved by the definition of gradients in nano- to macroscale order. We fabricate centimetre-scale material geometries including anchors, cables, lattices and webs, as well as functional materials with structure-dependent strength and anisotropic thermal transport. Finally, multiple three-dimensional geometries and doped nanofibrillar constructs are presented to illustrate the facile integration of synthetic and natural additives to form functional, interactive, hierarchical networks.</p>",[],False,"[""Peter Tseng"", ""Bradley Napier"", ""Siwei Zhao"", ""Alexander N.

article,Triboelectric nanogenerators for sensitive nano-coulomb molecular mass spectrometry,"<p>Ion sources for molecular mass spectrometry are usually driven by direct current power supplies with no user control over the total charges generated. Here, we show that the output of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can quantitatively control the total ionization charges in mass spectrometry. The high output voltage of TENGs can generate single- or alternating-polarity ion pulses, and is ideal for inducing nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) and plasma discharge ionization. For a given nanoESI emitter, accurately controlled ion pulses ranging from 1.0 to 5.5&#8197;nC were delivered with an onset charge of 1.0&#8197;nC. Spray pulses can be generated at a high frequency of 17&#8197;Hz (60&#8197;ms in period) and the pulse duration is adjustable on-demand between 60&#8197;ms and 5.5&#8197;s. Highly sensitive (&#8764;0.6 zeptomole) mass spectrometry analysis using minimal sample (18&#8197;pl per pulse) was achieved with a 10&#8197;pg&#8197;ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup> cocaine sample.

article,Single-molecule electrometry,"<p>Mass and electrical charge are fundamental properties of biological macromolecules. Although molecular mass has long been determined with atomic precision, a direct and precise determination of molecular charge remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report high-precision (&lt;1e) measurements of the electrical charge of molecules such as nucleic acids, and globular and disordered proteins in solution. The measurement is based on parallel external field-free trapping of single macromolecules, permits the estimation of a dielectric coefficient of the molecular interior and can be performed in real time. Further, we demonstrate the direct detection of single amino acid substitution and chemical modifications in proteins. As the electrical charge of a macromolecule strongly depends on its three-dimensional conformation, this kind of high-precision electrometry offers an approach to probe the structure, fluctuations and interactions of a single molecule in solution.</p>",[],False,"[""Francesca Ruggeri"", ""Franziska Zosel"", ""Natalie Mutter"", ""Miros\u0142awa R\u00f3\u017cycka"", ""Magdalena Wojtas"", ""Andrzej O\u017cyhar"", ""Benjamin Schuler"", ""Madhavi Krishnan""]","Ruggeri, F., Zosel, F., Mutter, N. et al.
