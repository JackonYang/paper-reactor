article,Resonant electron tunnelling assisted by charged domain walls in multiferroic tunnel junctions,"<p>The peculiar features of domain walls observed in ferroelectrics make them promising active elements for next-generation non-volatile memories, logic gates and energy-harvesting devices. Although extensive research activity has been devoted recently to making full use of this technological potential, concrete realizations of working nanodevices exploiting these functional properties are yet to be demonstrated. Here, we fabricate a multiferroic tunnel junction based on ferromagnetic La<sub>0.7</sub>Sr<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes separated by an ultrathin ferroelectric BaTiO<sub>3</sub> tunnel barrier, where a head-to-head domain wall is constrained. An electron gas stabilized by oxygen vacancies is confined within the domain wall, displaying discrete quantum-well energy levels. These states assist resonant electron tunnelling processes across the barrier, leading to strong quantum oscillations of the electrical conductance.</p>",[],False,"[""Gabriel Sanchez-Santolino"", ""Javier Tornos"", ""David Hernandez-Martin"", ""Juan I.

article,A solid-state single-photon filter,"<p>A strong limitation of linear optical quantum computing is the probabilistic operation of two-quantum-bit gates based on the coalescence of indistinguishable photons. A route to deterministic operation is to exploit the single-photon nonlinearity of an atomic transition. Through engineering of the atom&#8211;photon interaction, phase shifters, photon filters and photon&#8211;photon gates have been demonstrated with natural atoms. Proofs of concept have been reported with semiconductor quantum dots, yet limited by inefficient atom&#8211;photon interfaces and dephasing. Here, we report a highly efficient single-photon filter based on a large optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level, in a near-optimal quantum-dot cavity interface. When probed with coherent light wavepackets, the device shows a record nonlinearity threshold around 0.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.1 incident photons. We demonstrate that 80% of the directly reflected light intensity consists of a single-photon Fock state and that the two- and three-photon components are strongly suppressed compared with the single-photon one.</p>",[],False,"[""Lorenzo De Santis"", ""Carlos Ant\u00f3n"", ""Bogdan Reznychenko"", ""Niccolo Somaschi"", ""Guillaume Coppola"", ""Jean Senellart"", ""Carmen G\u00f3mez"", ""Aristide Lema\u00eetre"", ""Isabelle Sagnes"", ""Andrew G.

article,Position-dependent and millimetre-range photodetection in phototransistors with micrometre-scale graphene on SiC,"<p>The extraordinary optical and electronic properties of graphene make it a promising component of high-performance photodetectors. However, in typical graphene-based photodetectors demonstrated to date, the photoresponse only comes from specific locations near graphene over an area much smaller than the device size. For many optoelectronic device applications, it is desirable to obtain the photoresponse and positional sensitivity over a much larger area. Here, we report the spatial dependence of the photoresponse in backgated graphene field-effect transistors (GFET) on silicon carbide (SiC) substrates by scanning a focused laser beam across the GFET. The GFET shows a nonlocal photoresponse even when the SiC substrate is illuminated at distances greater than 500&#8197;&#181;m from the graphene. The photoresponsivity and photocurrent can be varied by more than one order of magnitude depending on the illumination position. Our observations are explained with a numerical model based on charge transport of photoexcited carriers in the substrate.</p>",[],False,"[""Biddut K.

article,Controlling propagation and coupling of waveguide modes using phase-gradient metasurfaces,"<p>Research on two-dimensional designer optical structures, or metasurfaces, has mainly focused on controlling the wavefronts of light propagating in free space. Here, we show that gradient metasurface structures consisting of phased arrays of plasmonic or dielectric nanoantennas can be used to control guided waves via strong optical scattering at subwavelength intervals. Based on this design principle, we experimentally demonstrate waveguide mode converters, polarization rotators and waveguide devices supporting asymmetric optical power transmission. We also demonstrate all-dielectric on-chip polarization rotators based on phased arrays of Mie resonators with negligible insertion losses.

article,Scalable electrophysiology in intact small animals with nanoscale suspended electrode arrays,"<p>Electrical measurements from large populations of animals would help reveal fundamental properties of the nervous system and neurological diseases. Small invertebrates are ideal for these large-scale studies; however, patch-clamp electrophysiology in microscopic animals typically requires invasive dissections and is low-throughput. To overcome these limitations, we present nano-SPEARs: suspended electrodes integrated into a scalable microfluidic device. Using this technology, we have made the first extracellular recordings of body-wall muscle electrophysiology inside an intact roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. We can also use nano-SPEARs to record from multiple animals in parallel and even from other species, such as Hydra littoralis. Furthermore, we use nano-SPEARs to establish the first electrophysiological phenotypes for C. elegans models for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and show a partial rescue of the Parkinson's phenotype through drug treatment. These results demonstrate that nano-SPEARs provide the core technology for microchips that enable scalable, in vivo studies of neurobiology and neurological diseases.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel L.

article,Neutrophil-mediated anticancer drug delivery for suppression of postoperative malignant glioma recurrence,"<p>Cell-mediated drug-delivery systems have received considerable attention for their enhanced therapeutic specificity and efficacy in cancer treatment. Neutrophils (NEs), the most abundant type of immune cells, are known to penetrate inflamed brain tumours. Here we show that NEs carrying liposomes that contain paclitaxel (PTX) can penetrate the brain and suppress the recurrence of glioma in mice whose tumour has been resected surgically. Inflammatory factors released after tumour resection guide the movement of the NEs into the inflamed brain. The highly concentrated inflammatory signals in the brain trigger the release of liposomal PTX from the NEs, which allows delivery of PTX into the remaining invading tumour cells. We show that this NE-mediated delivery of drugs efficiently slows the recurrent growth of tumours, with significantly improved survival rates, but does not completely inhibit the regrowth of tumours.</p>",[],False,"[""Jingwei Xue"", ""Zekai Zhao"", ""Lei Zhang"", ""Lingjing Xue"", ""Shiyang Shen"", ""Yajing Wen"", ""Zhuoyuan Wei"", ""Lu Wang"", ""Lingyi Kong"", ""Hongbin Sun"", ""Qineng Ping"", ""Ran Mo"", ""Can Zhang""]","Xue, J., Zhao, Z., Zhang, L. et al.

article,Peptide–MHC-based nanomedicines for autoimmunity function as T-cell receptor microclustering devices,"<p>We have shown that nanoparticles (NPs) can be used as ligand-multimerization platforms to activate specific cellular receptors in vivo. Nanoparticles coated with autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC) blunted autoimmune responses by triggering the differentiation and expansion of antigen-specific regulatory T cells in vivo. Here, we define the engineering principles impacting biological activity, detail a synthesis process yielding safe and stable compounds, and visualize how these nanomedicines interact with cognate T cells. We find that the triggering properties of pMHC&#8211;NPs are a function of pMHC intermolecular distance and involve the sustained assembly of large antigen receptor microclusters on murine and human cognate T cells. These compounds show no off-target toxicity in zebrafish embryos, do not cause haematological, biochemical or histological abnormalities, and are rapidly captured by phagocytes or processed by the hepatobiliary system.
