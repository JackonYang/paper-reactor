article,Magnetic brightening and control of dark excitons in monolayer WSe2,"<p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide crystals, as direct-gap materials with strong light&#8211;matter interactions, have attracted much recent attention. Because of their spin-polarized valence bands and a predicted spin splitting at the conduction band edges, the lowest-lying excitons in WX<sub>2</sub> (X&#8201;=&#8201;S, Se) are expected to be spin-forbidden and optically dark. To date, however, there has been no direct experimental probe of these dark excitons. Here, we show how an in-plane magnetic field can brighten the dark excitons in monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> and permit their properties to be observed experimentally. Precise energy levels for both the neutral and charged dark excitons are obtained and compared with ab initio calculations using the GW-BSE approach. As a result of their spin configuration, the brightened dark excitons exhibit much-increased emission and valley lifetimes. These studies directly probe the excitonic spin manifold and reveal the fine spin-splitting at the conduction band edges.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiao-Xiao Zhang"", ""Ting Cao"", ""Zhengguang Lu"", ""Yu-Chuan Lin"", ""Fan Zhang"", ""Ying Wang"", ""Zhiqiang Li"", ""James C.

article,Band-edge engineering for controlled multi-modal nanolasing in plasmonic superlattices,"<p>Single band-edge states can trap light and function as high-quality optical feedback for microscale lasers and nanolasers. However, access to more than a single band-edge mode for nanolasing has not been possible because of limited cavity designs. Here, we describe how plasmonic superlattices&#8212;finite-arrays of nanoparticles (patches) grouped into microscale arrays&#8212;can support multiple band-edge modes capable of multi-modal nanolasing at programmed emission wavelengths and with large mode spacings. Different lasing modes show distinct input&#8211;output light behaviour and decay dynamics that can be tailored by nanoparticle size. By modelling the superlattice nanolasers with a four-level gain system and a time-domain approach, we reveal that the accumulation of population inversion at plasmonic hot spots can be spatially modulated by the diffractive coupling order of the patches. Moreover, we show that symmetry-broken superlattices can sustain switchable nanolasing between a single mode and multiple modes.</p>",[],False,"[""Danqing Wang"", ""Ankun Yang"", ""Weijia Wang"", ""Yi Hua"", ""Richard D.

article,Ultrafast lithium diffusion in bilayer graphene,"<p>Solids that simultaneously conduct electrons and ions are key elements for the mass transfer and storage required in battery electrodes. Single-phase materials with a high electronic and high ionic conductivity at room temperature are hard to come by, and therefore multiphase systems with separate ion and electron channels have been put forward instead. Here we report on bilayer graphene as a single-phase mixed conductor that demonstrates Li diffusion faster than in graphite and even surpassing the diffusion of sodium chloride in liquid water. To measure Li diffusion, we have developed an on-chip electrochemical cell architecture in which the redox reaction that forces Li intercalation is localized only at a protrusion of the device so that the graphene bilayer remains unperturbed from the electrolyte during operation. We performed time-dependent Hall measurements across spatially displaced Hall probes to monitor the in-plane Li diffusion kinetics within the graphene bilayer and measured a diffusion coefficient as high as 7&#215;10<sup>&#8211;5</sup>&#8197;cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>&#8211;1</sup>.</p>",[],False,"[""Matthias K\u00fchne"", ""Federico Paolucci"", ""Jelena Popovic"", ""Pavel M.

The need for their miniaturization has fuelled the rapid growth of interest in two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, the performance of a p&#8211;n junction considerably degrades as its thickness approaches a few nanometres and traditional technologies, such as doping and implantation, become invalid at the nanoscale. Here we report stable non-volatile programmable p&#8211;n junctions fabricated from the vertically stacked all-2D semiconductor/insulator/metal layers (WSe<sub>2</sub>/hexagonal boron nitride/graphene) in a semifloating gate field-effect transistor configuration. The junction exhibits a good rectifying behaviour with a rectification ratio of 10<sup>4</sup> and photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency up to 4.1% under a 6.8&#8197;nW light.

article,"Inflammation-free, gas-permeable, lightweight, stretchable on-skin electronics with nanomeshes","<p>Thin-film electronic devices can be integrated with skin for health monitoring and/or for interfacing with machines. Minimal invasiveness is highly desirable when applying wearable electronics directly onto human skin. However, manufacturing such on-skin electronics on planar substrates results in limited gas permeability. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically investigate their long-term physiological and psychological effects. As a demonstration of substrate-free electronics, here we show the successful fabrication of inflammation-free, highly gas-permeable, ultrathin, lightweight and stretchable sensors that can be directly laminated onto human skin for long periods of time, realized with a conductive nanomesh structure. A one-week skin patch test revealed that the risk of inflammation caused by on-skin sensors can be significantly suppressed by using the nanomesh sensors. Furthermore, a wireless system that can detect touch, temperature and pressure is successfully demonstrated using a nanomesh with excellent mechanical durability.

article,Monitoring the orientation of rare-earth-doped nanorods for flow shear tomography,"<p>Rare-earth phosphors exhibit unique luminescence polarization features originating from the anisotropic symmetry of the emitter ion's chemical environment. However, to take advantage of this peculiar property, it is necessary to control and measure the ensemble orientation of the host particles with a high degree of precision. Here, we show a methodology to obtain the photoluminescence polarization of Eu-doped LaPO<sub>4</sub> nanorods assembled in an electrically modulated liquid-crystalline phase. We measure Eu<sup>3+</sup> emission spectra for the three main optical configurations (&#963;, &#960; and &#945;, depending on the direction of observation and the polarization axes) and use them as a reference for the nanorod orientation analysis. Based on the fact that flowing nanorods tend to orient along the shear strain profile, we use this orientation analysis to measure the local shear rate in a flowing liquid. The potential of this approach is then demonstrated through tomographic imaging of the shear rate distribution in a microfluidic system.</p>",[],False,"[""Jongwook Kim"", ""S\u00e9bastien Michelin"", ""Michiel Hilbers"", ""Lucio Martinelli"", ""Elodie Chaudan"", ""Gabriel Amselem"", ""Etienne Fradet"", ""Jean-Pierre Boilot"", ""Albert M.

article,A spatially localized architecture for fast and modular DNA computing,"<p>Cells use spatial constraints to control and accelerate the flow of information in enzyme cascades and signalling networks. Synthetic silicon-based circuitry similarly relies on spatial constraints to process information. Here, we show that spatial organization can be a similarly powerful design principle for overcoming limitations of speed and modularity in engineered molecular circuits. We create logic gates and signal transmission lines by spatially arranging reactive DNA hairpins on a DNA origami. Signal propagation is demonstrated across transmission lines of different lengths and orientations and logic gates are modularly combined into circuits that establish the universality of our approach. Because reactions preferentially occur between neighbours, identical DNA hairpins can be reused across circuits. Co-localization of circuit elements decreases computation time from hours to minutes compared to circuits with diffusible components. Detailed computational models enable predictive circuit design. We anticipate our approach will motivate using spatial constraints for future molecular control circuit designs.</p>",[],False,"[""Gourab Chatterjee"", ""Neil Dalchau"", ""Richard A.
