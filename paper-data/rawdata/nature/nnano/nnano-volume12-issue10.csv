article,Spatially and time-resolved magnetization dynamics driven by spin–orbit torques,"<p>Current-induced spin&#8211;orbit torques are one of the most effective ways to manipulate the magnetization in spintronic devices, and hold promise for fast switching applications in non-volatile memory and logic units. Here, we report the direct observation of spin&#8211;orbit-torque-driven magnetization dynamics in Pt/Co/AlO<sub>x</sub> dots during current pulse injection. Time-resolved X-ray images with 25&#8197;nm spatial and 100&#8197;ps temporal resolution reveal that switching is achieved within the duration of a subnanosecond current pulse by the fast nucleation of an inverted domain at the edge of the dot and propagation of a tilted domain wall across the dot. The nucleation point is deterministic and alternates between the four dot quadrants depending on the sign of the magnetization, current and external field. Our measurements reveal how the magnetic symmetry is broken by the concerted action of the damping-like and field-like spin&#8211;orbit torques and the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, and show that reproducible switching events can be obtained for over 10<sup>12</sup> reversal cycles.</p>",[],True,"[""Manuel Baumgartner"", ""Kevin Garello"", ""Johannes Mendil"", ""Can Onur Avci"", ""Eva Grimaldi"", ""Christoph Murer"", ""Junxiao Feng"", ""Mihai Gabureac"", ""Christian Stamm"", ""Yves Acremann"", ""Simone Finizio"", ""Sebastian Wintz"", ""J\u00f6rg Raabe"", ""Pietro Gambardella""]","Baumgartner, M., Garello, K., Mendil, J. et al.

article,Room-temperature continuous-wave lasing from monolayer molybdenum ditelluride integrated with a silicon nanobeam cavity,"<p>Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have the potential to become efficient optical-gain materials for low-energy-consumption nanolasers with the smallest gain media because of strong excitonic emission. However, until now TMD-based lasing has been realized only at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate for the first time a room-temperature laser operation in the infrared region from a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride on a silicon photonic-crystal cavity. The observation is enabled by the unique combination of a TMD monolayer with an emission wavelength transparent to silicon, and a high-Q cavity of the silicon nanobeam. The laser is pumped by a continuous-wave excitation, with a threshold density of 6.6&#8197;W cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup>. Its linewidth is as narrow as 0.202&#8197;nm with a corresponding Q of 5,603, the largest value reported for a TMD laser. This demonstration establishes TMDs as practical materials for integrated TMD&#8211;silicon nanolasers suitable for silicon-based nanophotonic applications in silicon-transparent wavelengths.</p>",[],False,"[""Yongzhuo Li"", ""Jianxing Zhang"", ""Dandan Huang"", ""Hao Sun"", ""Fan Fan"", ""Jiabin Feng"", ""Zhen Wang"", ""C.

article,Air-stable and freestanding lithium alloy/graphene foil as an alternative to lithium metal anodes,"<p>Developing high-capacity anodes is a must to improve the energy density of lithium batteries for electric vehicle applications. Alloy anodes are one promising option, but without pre-stored lithium, the overall energy density is limited by the low-capacity lithium metal oxide cathodes. Recently, lithium metal has been revived as a high-capacity anode, but faces several challenges owing to its high reactivity and uncontrolled dendrite growth. Here, we show a series of Li-containing foils inheriting the desirable properties of alloy anodes and pure metal anodes. They consist of densely packed Li<sub>x</sub>M (M&#8201;=&#8201;Si, Sn, or Al) nanoparticles encapsulated by large graphene sheets. With the protection of graphene sheets, the large and freestanding Li<sub>x</sub>M/graphene foils are stable in different air conditions. With fully expanded Li<sub>x</sub>Si confined in the highly conductive and chemically stable graphene matrix, this Li<sub>x</sub>Si/graphene foil maintains a stable structure and cyclability in half cells (400 cycles with 98% capacity retention). This foil is also paired with high-capacity Li-free V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and sulfur cathodes to achieve stable full-cell cycling.</p>",[],False,"[""Jie Zhao"", ""Guangmin Zhou"", ""Kai Yan"", ""Jin Xie"", ""Yuzhang Li"", ""Lei Liao"", ""Yang Jin"", ""Kai Liu"", ""Po-Chun Hsu"", ""Jiangyan Wang"", ""Hui-Ming Cheng"", ""Yi Cui""]","Zhao, J., Zhou, G., Yan, K. et al.

article,Controlling energy flow in multimetallic nanostructures for plasmonic catalysis,"<p>It has been shown that photoexcitation of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au and Cu) can induce direct photochemical reactions. However, the widespread application of this technology in catalysis has been limited by the relatively poor chemical reactivity of noble metal surfaces. Despite efforts to combine plasmonic and catalytic metals, the physical mechanisms that govern energy transfer from plasmonic metals to catalytic metals remain unclear. Here we show that hybrid core&#8211;shell nanostructures in which a core plasmonic metal harvests visible-light photons can selectively channel that energy into catalytically active centres on the nanostructure shell. To accomplish this, we developed a synthetic protocol to deposit a few monolayers of Pt onto Ag nanocubes. This model system allows us to conclusively separate the optical and catalytic functions of the hybrid nanomaterial and determine that the flow of energy is strongly biased towards the excitation of energetic charge carriers in the Pt shell. We demonstrate the utility of these nanostructures for photocatalytic chemical reactions in the preferential oxidation of CO in excess H<sub>2</sub>. Our data demonstrate that the reaction occurs exclusively on the Pt surface.</p>",[],False,"[""Umar Aslam"", ""Steven Chavez"", ""Suljo Linic""]","Aslam, U., Chavez, S. & Linic, S.

article,Electromagnetized gold nanoparticles mediate direct lineage reprogramming into induced dopamine neurons in vivo for Parkinson's disease therapy,"<p>Electromagnetic fields (EMF) are physical energy fields generated by electrically charged objects, and specific ranges of EMF can influence numerous biological processes, which include the control of cell fate and plasticity. In this study, we show that electromagnetized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the presence of specific EMF conditions facilitate an efficient direct lineage reprogramming to induced dopamine neurons in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, electromagnetic stimulation leads to a specific activation of the histone acetyltransferase Brd2, which results in histone H3K27 acetylation and a robust activation of neuron-specific genes. In vivo dopaminergic neuron reprogramming by EMF stimulation of AuNPs efficiently and non-invasively alleviated symptoms in mouse Parkinson's disease models.
