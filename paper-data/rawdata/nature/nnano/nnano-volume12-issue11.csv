article,Coplanar semiconductor–metal circuitry defined on few-layer MoTe2 via polymorphic heteroepitaxy,"<p>Crystal polymorphism selectively stabilizes the electronic phase of atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) as metallic or semiconducting, suggesting the potential to integrate these polymorphs as circuit components in two-dimensional electronic circuitry. Developing a selective and sequential growth strategy for such two-dimensional polymorphs in the vapour phase is a critical step in this endeavour. Here, we report on the polymorphic integration of distinct metallic (1T&#8242;) and semiconducting (2H) MoTe<sub>2</sub> crystals within the same atomic planes by heteroepitaxy. The realized polymorphic coplanar contact is atomically coherent, and its barrier potential is spatially tight-confined over a length of only a few nanometres, with a lowest contact barrier height of &#8764;25&#8197;meV. We also demonstrate the generality of our synthetic integration approach for other TMDC polymorph films with large areas.</p>",[],False,"[""Ji Ho Sung"", ""Hoseok Heo"", ""Saerom Si"", ""Yong Hyeon Kim"", ""Hyeong Rae Noh"", ""Kyung Song"", ""Juho Kim"", ""Chang-Soo Lee"", ""Seung-Young Seo"", ""Dong-Hwi Kim"", ""Hyoung Kug Kim"", ""Han Woong Yeom"", ""Tae-Hwan Kim"", ""Si-Young Choi"", ""Jun Sung Kim"", ""Moon-Ho Jo""]","Sung, J., Heo, H., Si, S. et al.

article,Conformation-based signal transfer and processing at the single-molecule level,"<p>Building electronic components made of individual molecules is a promising strategy for the miniaturization and integration of electronic devices. However, the practical realization of molecular devices and circuits for signal transmission and processing at room temperature has proven challenging. Here, we present room-temperature intermolecular signal transfer and processing using SnCl<sub>2</sub>Pc molecules on a Cu(100) surface. The in-plane orientations of the molecules are effectively coupled via intermolecular interaction and serve as the information carrier. In the coupled molecular arrays, the signal can be transferred from one molecule to another in the in-plane direction along predesigned routes and processed to realize logical operations. These phenomena enable the use of molecules displaying intrinsic bistable states as complex molecular devices and circuits with novel functions.</p>",[],False,"[""Chao Li"", ""Zhongping Wang"", ""Yan Lu"", ""Xiaoqing Liu"", ""Li Wang""]","Li, C., Wang, Z., Lu, Y. et al.

article,Atomically precise graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions from a single molecular precursor,"<p>The rational bottom-up synthesis of atomically defined graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions represents an enabling technology for the design of nanoscale electronic devices. Synthetic strategies used thus far have relied on the random copolymerization of two electronically distinct molecular precursors to yield GNR heterojunctions. Here we report the fabrication and electronic characterization of atomically precise GNR heterojunctions prepared through late-stage functionalization of chevron GNRs obtained from a single precursor. Post-growth excitation of fully cyclized GNRs induces cleavage of sacrificial carbonyl groups, resulting in atomically well-defined heterojunctions within a single GNR. The GNR heterojunction structure was characterized using bond-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy, which enables chemical bond imaging at T&#8201;=&#8201;4.5&#8197;K. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals that band alignment across the heterojunction interface yields a type II heterojunction, in agreement with first-principles calculations. GNR heterojunction band realignment proceeds over a distance less than 1&#8197;nm, leading to extremely large effective fields.</p>",[],False,"[""Giang D. Nguyen"", ""Hsin-Zon Tsai"", ""Arash A.

article,Effective NaCl and dye rejection of hybrid graphene oxide/graphene layered membranes,"<p>Carbon nanomaterials are robust and possess fascinating properties useful for separation technology applications, but their scalability and high salt rejection when in a strong cross flow for long periods of time remain challenging. Here, we present a graphene-based membrane that is prepared using a simple and environmentally friendly method by spray coating an aqueous dispersion of graphene oxide/few-layered graphene/deoxycholate. The membranes were robust enough to withstand strong cross-flow shear for a prolonged period (120&#8197;h) while maintaining NaCl rejection near 85% and 96% for an anionic dye. Experimental results and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the presence of deoxycholate enhances NaCl rejection in these graphene-based membranes. In addition, these novel hybrid-layered membranes exhibit better chlorine resistance than pure graphene oxide membranes. The desalination performance and aggressive shear and chlorine resistance of these scalable graphene-based membranes are promising for use in practical water separation applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Aaron Morelos-Gomez"", ""Rodolfo Cruz-Silva"", ""Hiroyuki Muramatsu"", ""Josue Ortiz-Medina"", ""Takumi Araki"", ""Tomoyuki Fukuyo"", ""Syogo Tejima"", ""Kenji Takeuchi"", ""Takuya Hayashi"", ""Mauricio Terrones"", ""Morinobu Endo""]","Morelos-Gomez, A., Cruz-Silva, R., Muramatsu, H. et al.

article,Focal molography is a new method for the in situ analysis of molecular interactions in biological samples,"<p>Focal molography is a next-generation biosensor that visualizes specific biomolecular interactions in real time. It transduces affinity modulation on the sensor surface into refractive index modulation caused by target molecules that are bound to a precisely assembled nanopattern of molecular recognition sites, termed the &#8216;mologram&#8217;. The mologram is designed so that laser light is scattered at specifically bound molecules, generating a strong signal in the focus of the mologram via constructive interference, while scattering at nonspecifically bound molecules does not contribute to the effect. We present the realization of molograms on a chip by submicrometre near-field reactive immersion lithography on a light-sensitive monolithic graft copolymer layer. We demonstrate the selective and sensitive detection of biomolecules, which bind to the recognition sites of the mologram in various complex biological samples. This allows the label-free analysis of non-covalent interactions in complex biological samples, without a need for extensive sample preparation, and enables novel time- and cost-saving ways of performing and developing immunoassays for diagnostic tests.</p>",[],False,"[""Volker Gatterdam"", ""Andreas Frutiger"", ""Klaus-Peter Stengele"", ""Dieter Heindl"", ""Thomas L\u00fcbbers"", ""Janos V\u00f6r\u00f6s"", ""Christof Fattinger""]","Gatterdam, V., Frutiger, A., Stengele, KP. et al.

article,Glomerular barrier behaves as an atomically precise bandpass filter in a sub-nanometre regime,"<p>The glomerular filtration barrier is known as a &#8216;size cutoff&#8217; slit, which retains nanoparticles or proteins larger than 6&#8211;8&#8197;nm in the body and rapidly excretes smaller ones through the kidneys. However, in the sub-nanometre size regime, we have found that this barrier behaves as an atomically precise &#8216;bandpass&#8217; filter to significantly slow down renal clearance of few-atom gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with the same surface ligands but different sizes (Au<sub>18</sub>, Au<sub>15</sub> and Au<sub>10-11</sub>). Compared to Au<sub>25</sub> (&#8764;1.0&#8197;nm), just few-atom decreases in size result in four- to ninefold reductions in renal clearance efficiency in the early elimination stage, because the smaller AuNCs are more readily trapped by the glomerular glycocalyx than larger ones. This unique in vivo nano&#8211;bio interaction in the sub-nanometre regime also slows down the extravasation of sub-nanometre AuNCs from normal blood vessels and enhances their passive targeting to cancerous tissues through an enhanced permeability and retention effect. This discovery highlights the size precision in the body's response to nanoparticles and opens a new pathway to develop nanomedicines for many diseases associated with glycocalyx dysfunction.</p>",[],False,"[""Bujie Du"", ""Xingya Jiang"", ""Anindita Das"", ""Qinhan Zhou"", ""Mengxiao Yu"", ""Rongchao Jin"", ""Jie Zheng""]","Du, B., Jiang, X., Das, A. et al.
