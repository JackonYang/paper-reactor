article,Towards zero-threshold optical gain using charged semiconductor quantum dots,"<p>Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots are attractive materials for the realization of solution-processable lasers. However, their applications as optical-gain media are complicated by a non-unity degeneracy of band-edge states, because of which multiexcitons are required to achieve the lasing regime. This increases the lasing thresholds and leads to very short optical gain lifetimes limited by nonradiative Auger recombination. Here, we show that these problems can be at least partially resolved by employing not neutral but negatively charged quantum dots. By applying photodoping to specially engineered quantum dots with impeded Auger decay, we demonstrate a considerable reduction of the optical gain threshold due to suppression of ground-state absorption by pre-existing carriers. Moreover, by injecting approximately one electron per dot on average, we achieve a more than twofold reduction in the amplified spontaneous emission threshold, bringing it to the sub-single-exciton level. These measurements indicate the feasibility of &#8216;zero-threshold&#8217; gain achievable by completely blocking the band-edge state with two electrons.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Chemistry Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, 87545, New Mexico, USA', 'authors': ['Kaifeng Wu', ',\xa0Young-Shin Park', ',\xa0Jaehoon Lim', '\xa0&\xa0Victor I.

article,Multifunctional high-performance van der Waals heterostructures,"<p>A range of novel two-dimensional materials have been actively explored for More Moore and More-than-Moore device applications because of their ability to form van der Waals heterostructures with unique electronic properties. However, most of the reported electronic devices exhibit insufficient control of multifunctional operations. Here, we leverage the band-structure alignment properties of narrow-bandgap black phosphorus and large-bandgap molybdenum disulfide to realize vertical heterostructures with an ultrahigh rectifying ratio approaching 10<sup>6</sup> and on&#8211;off ratio up to 10<sup>7</sup>. Furthermore, we design and fabricate tunable multivalue inverters, in which the output logic state and window of the mid-logic can be controlled by specific pairs of channel length and, most importantly, by the electric field, which shifts the band-structure alignment across the heterojunction. Finally, high gains over 150 are achieved in the inverters with optimized device geometries, showing great potential for future logic applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center and School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China', 'authors': ['Mingqiang Huang', ',\xa0Shengman Li', ',\xa0Zhenfeng Zhang', ',\xa0Xiong Xiong', ',\xa0Xuefei Li', '\xa0&\xa0Yanqing Wu']}, {'address': 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China', 'authors': ['Xuefei Li', '\xa0&\xa0Yanqing Wu']}]",False,"['Mingqiang Huang', 'Shengman Li', 'Zhenfeng Zhang', 'Xiong Xiong', 'Xuefei Li', 'Yanqing Wu']","Huang, M., Li, S., Zhang, Z. et al.

article,Directed emission of CdSe nanoplatelets originating from strongly anisotropic 2D electronic structure,"<p>Intrinsically directional light emitters are potentially important for applications in photonics including lasing and energy-efficient display technology. Here, we propose a new route to overcome intrinsic efficiency limitations in light-emitting devices by studying a CdSe nanoplatelets monolayer that exhibits strongly anisotropic, directed photoluminescence. Analysis of the two-dimensional k-space distribution reveals the underlying internal transition dipole distribution. The observed directed emission is related to the anisotropy of the electronic Bloch states governing the exciton transition dipole moment and forming a bright plane. The strongly directed emission perpendicular to the platelet is further enhanced by the optical local density of states and local fields. In contrast to the emission directionality, the off-resonant absorption into the energetically higher 2D-continuum of states is isotropic. These contrasting optical properties make the oriented CdSe nanoplatelets, or superstructures of parallel-oriented platelets, an interesting and potentially useful class of semiconductor-based emitters.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Optics and Atomic Physics, Technical University of Berlin, Strasse des 17.

article,Protein recognition by a pattern-generating fluorescent molecular probe,"<p>Fluorescent molecular probes have become valuable tools in protein research; however, the current methods for using these probes are less suitable for analysing specific populations of proteins in their native environment. In this study, we address this gap by developing a unimolecular fluorescent probe that combines the properties of small-molecule-based probes and cross-reactive sensor arrays (the so-called chemical &#8216;noses/tongues&#8217;). On the one hand, the probe can detect different proteins by generating unique identification (ID) patterns, akin to cross-reactive arrays. On the other hand, its unimolecular scaffold and selective binding enable this ID-generating probe to identify combinations of specific protein families within complex mixtures and to discriminate among isoforms in living cells, where macroscopic arrays cannot access. The ability to recycle the molecular device and use it to track several binding interactions simultaneously further demonstrates how this approach could expand the fluorescent toolbox currently used to detect and image proteins.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 7610001, Israel', 'authors': ['Zohar Pode', ',\xa0Ronny Peri-Naor', ',\xa0Leila Motiei', '\xa0&\xa0David Margulies']}, {'address': 'Department of Structural Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 7610001, Israel', 'authors': ['Joseph M.

article,Length-independent DNA packing into nanopore zero-mode waveguides for low-input DNA sequencing,"<p>Compared with conventional methods, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing exhibits longer read lengths than conventional methods, less GC bias, and the ability to read DNA base modifications. However, reading DNA sequence from sub-nanogram quantities is impractical owing to inefficient delivery of DNA molecules into the confines of zero-mode waveguides&#8212;zeptolitre optical cavities in which DNA sequencing proceeds. Here, we show that the efficiency of voltage-induced DNA loading into waveguides equipped with nanopores at their floors is five orders of magnitude greater than existing methods. In addition, we find that DNA loading is nearly length-independent, unlike diffusive loading, which is biased towards shorter fragments. We demonstrate here loading and proof-of-principle four-colour sequence readout of a polymerase-bound 20,000-base-pair-long DNA template within seconds from a sub-nanogram input quantity, a step towards low-input DNA sequencing and mammalian epigenomic mapping of native DNA samples.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Northeastern University, Boston, 02115, Massachusetts, USA', 'authors': ['Joseph Larkin', ',\xa0Robert Y.

article,Inner- and outer-wall sorting of double-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) consist of two coaxially aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and previous sorting methods only achieved outer-wall electronic-type selectivity. Here, a separation technique capable of sorting DWCNTs by semiconducting (S) or metallic (M) inner- and outer-wall electronic type is presented. Electronic coupling between the inner and outer wall is used to alter the surfactant coating around each of the DWCNT types, and aqueous gel permeation is used to separate them. Aqueous methods are used to remove SWCNT species from the raw material and prepare enriched DWCNT fractions. The enriched DWCNT fractions are then transferred into either chlorobenzene or toluene using the copolymer PFO&#8211;BPy to yield the four inner@outer combinations of M@M, M@S, S@M and S@S. The high purity of the resulting fractions is verified by absorption measurements, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, resonance Raman mapping and high-density field-effect transistor devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, 76021, Germany', 'authors': ['Han Li', ',\xa0Venkata Sai Kiran Chakravadhanula', ',\xa0Shyam Kumar Chethala Neelakandhan', ',\xa0Frank Hennrich', ',\xa0Ralph Krupke', '\xa0&\xa0Benjamin Scott Flavel']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, 14195, Germany', 'authors': ['Georgy Gordeev', ',\xa0Sören Wasserroth', '\xa0&\xa0Stephanie Reich']}, {'address': 'Helmholtz Institute Ulm Electrochemical Energy Storage, Ulm, 89081, Germany', 'authors': ['Venkata Sai Kiran Chakravadhanula']}, {'address': 'Institute of Materials Science, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Darmstadt, 64287, Germany', 'authors': ['Shyam Kumar Chethala Neelakandhan', ',\xa0Ralph Krupke', '\xa0&\xa0Benjamin Scott Flavel']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil', 'authors': ['Ado Jorio']}]",False,"['Han Li', 'Georgy Gordeev', 'Sören Wasserroth', 'Venkata Sai Kiran Chakravadhanula', 'Shyam Kumar Chethala Neelakandhan', 'Frank Hennrich', 'Ado Jorio', 'Stephanie Reich', 'Ralph Krupke', 'Benjamin Scott Flavel']","Li, H., Gordeev, G., Wasserroth, S. et al.

article,Cell-targetable DNA nanocapsules for spatiotemporal release of caged bioactive small molecules,"<p>Achieving triggered release of small molecules with spatial and temporal precision at designated cells within an organism remains a challenge. By combining a cell-targetable, icosahedral DNA-nanocapsule loaded with photoresponsive polymers, we show cytosolic delivery of small molecules with the spatial resolution of single endosomes in specific cells in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our technology can report on the extent of small molecules released after photoactivation as well as pinpoint the location at which uncaging of the molecules occurred. We apply this technology to release dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a neurosteroid that promotes neurogenesis and neuron survival, and determined the timescale of neuronal activation by DHEA, using light-induced release of DHEA from targeted DNA nanocapsules. Importantly, sequestration inside the DNA capsule prevents photocaged DHEA from activating neurons prematurely. Our methodology can in principle be generalized to diverse neurostimulatory molecules.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, 60637, Illinois, USA', 'authors': ['Aneesh T.

article,A synthetic intrabody-based selective and generic inhibitor of GPCR endocytosis,"<p>Beta-arrestins (&#946;arrs) critically mediate desensitization, endocytosis and signalling of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and they scaffold a large number of interaction partners. However, allosteric modulation of their scaffolding abilities and direct targeting of their interaction interfaces to modulate GPCR functions selectively have not been fully explored yet. Here we identified a series of synthetic antibody fragments (Fabs) against different conformations of &#946;arrs from phage display libraries. Several of these Fabs allosterically and selectively modulated the interaction of &#946;arrs with clathrin and ERK MAP kinase. Interestingly, one of these Fabs selectively disrupted &#946;arr&#8211;clathrin interaction, and when expressed as an intrabody, it robustly inhibited agonist-induced endocytosis of a broad set of GPCRs without affecting ERK MAP kinase activation. Our data therefore demonstrate the feasibility of selectively targeting &#946;arr interactions using intrabodies and provide a novel framework for fine-tuning GPCR functions with potential therapeutic implications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, 208016, India', 'authors': ['Eshan Ghosh', ',\xa0Ashish Srivastava', ',\xa0Mithu Baidya', ',\xa0Punita Kumari', ',\xa0Hemlata Dwivedi', ',\xa0Kumari Nidhi', ',\xa0Ravi Ranjan', '\xa0&\xa0Arun K.
