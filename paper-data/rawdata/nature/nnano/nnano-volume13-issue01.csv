letter,Electric polarization switching in an atomically thin binary rock salt structure,"<p>Inducing and controlling electric dipoles is hindered in the ultrathin limit by the finite screening length of surface charges at metal&#8211;insulator junctions, although this effect can be circumvented by specially designed interfaces. Heterostructures of insulating materials hold great promise, as confirmed by perovskite oxide superlattices with compositional substitution to artificially break the structural inversion symmetry. Bringing this concept to the ultrathin limit would substantially broaden the range of materials and functionalities that could be exploited in novel nanoscale device designs. Here, we report that non-zero electric polarization can be induced and reversed in a hysteretic manner in bilayers made of ultrathin insulators whose electric polarization cannot be switched individually. In particular, we explore the interface between ionic rock salt alkali halides such as NaCl or KBr and polar insulating Cu<sub>2</sub>N terminating bulk copper. The strong compositional asymmetry between the polar Cu<sub>2</sub>N and the vacuum gap breaks inversion symmetry in the alkali halide layer, inducing out-of-plane dipoles that are stabilized in one orientation (self-poling). The dipole orientation can be reversed by a critical electric field, producing sharp switching of the tunnel current passing through the junction.</p>",[],False,"[""Jose Martinez-Castro"", ""Marten Piantek"", ""Sonja Schubert"", ""Mats Persson"", ""David Serrate"", ""Cyrus F.

letter,Steep-slope hysteresis-free negative capacitance MoS2 transistors,"<p>The so-called Boltzmann tyranny defines the fundamental thermionic limit of the subthreshold slope of a metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) at 60&#8201;mV&#8201;dec<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at room temperature and therefore precludes lowering of the supply voltage and overall power consumption. Adding a ferroelectric negative capacitor to the gate stack of a MOSFET may offer a promising solution to bypassing this fundamental barrier. Meanwhile, two-dimensional semiconductors such as atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides, due to their low dielectric constant and ease of integration into a junctionless transistor topology, offer enhanced electrostatic control of the channel. Here, we combine these two advantages and demonstrate a molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) two-dimensional steep-slope transistor with a ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide layer in the gate dielectric stack. This device exhibits excellent performance in both on and off states, with a maximum drain current of 510&#8201;&#956;A&#8201;&#956;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and a sub-thermionic subthreshold slope, and is essentially hysteresis-free. Negative differential resistance was observed at room temperature in the MoS<sub>2</sub> negative-capacitance FETs as the result of negative capacitance due to the negative drain-induced barrier lowering.

letter,Observation of Dirac bands in artificial graphene in small-period nanopatterned GaAs quantum wells,"<p>Charge carriers in graphene behave like massless Dirac fermions (MDFs) with linear energy-momentum dispersion, providing a condensed-matter platform for studying quasiparticles with relativistic-like features. Artificial graphene (AG)&#8212;a structure with an artificial honeycomb lattice&#8212;exhibits novel phenomena due to the tunable interplay between topology and quasiparticle interactions. So far, the emergence of a Dirac band structure supporting MDFs has been observed in AG using molecular, atomic and photonic systems, including those with semiconductor microcavities. Here, we report the realization of an AG that has a band structure with vanishing density of states consistent with the presence of MDFs. This observation is enabled by a very small lattice constant (a&#8201;=&#8201;50&#8201;nm) of the nanofabricated AG patterns superimposed on a two-dimensional electron gas hosted by a high-quality GaAs quantum well. Resonant inelastic light-scattering spectra reveal low-lying transitions that are not present in the unpatterned GaAs quantum well. These excitations reveal the energy dependence of the joint density of states for AG band transitions. Fermi level tuning through the Dirac point results in a collapse of the density of states at low transition energy, suggesting the emergence of the MDF linear dispersion in the AG.</p>",[],False,"[""Sheng Wang"", ""Diego Scarabelli"", ""Lingjie Du"", ""Yuliya Y.

letter,Controllable molecular motors engineered from myosin and RNA,"<p>Engineering biomolecular motors can provide direct tests of structure&#8211;function relationships and customized components for controlling molecular transport in artificial systems or in living cells. Previously, synthetic nucleic acid motors and modified natural protein motors have been developed in separate complementary strategies to achieve tunable and controllable motor function. Integrating protein and nucleic-acid components to form engineered nucleoprotein motors may enable additional sophisticated functionalities. However, this potential has only begun to be explored in pioneering work harnessing DNA scaffolds to dictate the spacing, number and composition of tethered protein motors. Here, we describe myosin motors that incorporate RNA lever arms, forming hybrid assemblies in which conformational changes in the protein motor domain are amplified and redirected by nucleic acid structures. The RNA lever arm geometry determines the speed and direction of motor transport and can be dynamically controlled using programmed transitions in the lever arm structure. We have characterized the hybrid motors using in vitro motility assays, single-molecule tracking, cryo-electron microscopy and structural probing. Our designs include nucleoprotein motors that reversibly change direction in response to oligonucleotides that drive strand-displacement reactions. In multimeric assemblies, the controllable motors walk processively along actin filaments at speeds of 10&#8211;20&#8201;nm&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Finally, to illustrate the potential for multiplexed addressable control, we demonstrate sequence-specific responses of RNA variants to oligonucleotide signals.</p>",[],False,"[""Tosan Omabegho"", ""Pinar S.

letter,Out-of-plane heat transfer in van der Waals stacks through electron–hyperbolic phonon coupling,"<p>Van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as promising building blocks that offer access to new physics, novel device functionalities and superior electrical and optoelectronic properties. Applications such as thermal management, photodetection, light emission, data communication, high-speed electronics and light harvesting require a thorough understanding of (nanoscale) heat flow. Here, using time-resolved photocurrent measurements, we identify an efficient out-of-plane energy transfer channel, where charge carriers in graphene couple to hyperbolic phonon polaritons in the encapsulating layered material. This hyperbolic cooling is particularly efficient, giving picosecond cooling times for hexagonal BN, where the high-momentum hyperbolic phonon polaritons enable efficient near-field energy transfer. We study this heat transfer mechanism using distinct control knobs to vary carrier density and lattice temperature, and find excellent agreement with theory without any adjustable parameters.

article,A graphene Zener–Klein transistor cooled by a hyperbolic substrate,"<p>The engineering of cooling mechanisms is a bottleneck in nanoelectronics. Thermal exchanges in diffusive graphene are mostly driven by defect-assisted acoustic phonon scattering, but the case of high-mobility graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is radically different, with a prominent contribution of remote phonons from the substrate. Bilayer graphene on a hBN transistor with a local gate is driven in a regime where almost perfect current saturation is achieved by compensation of the decrease in the carrier density and Zener&#8211;Klein tunnelling (ZKT) at high bias. Using noise thermometry, we show that the ZKT triggers a new cooling pathway due to the emission of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hBN by out-of-equilibrium electron&#8211;hole pairs beyond the super-Planckian regime.

As current technologies approach fundamental limits on size and thermal stability, enhancing functionality through embracing the strong interactions present at high array densities becomes attractive. In this respect, artificial spin ices are geometrically frustrated magnetic metamaterials that offer&#160;vast untapped potential due to their unique microstate landscapes, with intriguing prospects in applications from reconfigurable logic to magnonic devices or hardware neural networks. However, progress in such systems is impeded by the inability to access more than a fraction of the total microstate space.

article,Radiative control of dark excitons at room temperature by nano-optical antenna-tip Purcell effect,"<p>Excitons, Coulomb-bound electron&#8211;hole pairs, are elementary photo-excitations in semiconductors that can couple to light through radiative relaxation.

article,Bacterial resistance to silver nanoparticles and how to overcome it,"<p>Silver nanoparticles have already been successfully applied in various biomedical and antimicrobial technologies and products used in everyday life. Although bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been extensively discussed in the literature, the possible development of resistance to silver nanoparticles has not been fully explored. We report that the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli 013, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCM 3955 and E. coli CCM 3954 can develop resistance to silver nanoparticles after repeated exposure. The resistance stems from the production of the adhesive flagellum protein flagellin, which triggers the aggregation of the nanoparticles. This resistance evolves without any genetic changes; only phenotypic change is needed to reduce the nanoparticles&#8217; colloidal stability and thus eliminate their antibacterial activity. The resistance mechanism cannot be overcome by additional stabilization of silver nanoparticles using surfactants or polymers.

First, we identified the optimal NP formulation through comprehensive analyses of release profiles and cellular-uptake and cell&#160;viability studies.

article,Nanoparticle orientation to control RNA loading and ligand display on extracellular vesicles for cancer regression,"<p>Nanotechnology offers many benefits, and here we report an advantage of applying RNA nanotechnology for directional control. The orientation of arrow-shaped RNA was altered to control ligand display on extracellular vesicle membranes for specific cell targeting, or to regulate intracellular trafficking of small interfering RNA (siRNA)&#160;or microRNA (miRNA). Placing membrane-anchoring cholesterol at the tail of the arrow results in display of RNA aptamer or folate on the outer surface of the extracellular vesicle. In contrast, placing the cholesterol at the arrowhead results in partial loading of RNA nanoparticles into the extracellular vesicles. Taking advantage of the RNA ligand for specific targeting and extracellular vesicles for efficient membrane fusion, the resulting ligand-displaying extracellular vesicles were capable of specific delivery of siRNA to cells, and efficiently blocked tumour growth in three cancer models. Extracellular vesicles displaying an aptamer that binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen, and loaded with survivin siRNA, inhibited prostate cancer xenograft. The same extracellular vesicle instead&#160;displaying epidermal growth-factor receptor aptamer inhibited orthotopic breast cancer models. Likewise, survivin&#160;siRNA-loaded and folate-displaying extracellular vesicles inhibited patient-derived colorectal cancer xenograft.</p>",[],False,"[""Fengmei Pi"", ""Daniel W.
