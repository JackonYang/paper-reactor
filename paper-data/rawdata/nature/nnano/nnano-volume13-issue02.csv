letter,A quantum-dot spin qubit with coherence limited by charge noise and fidelity higher than 99.9%,"<p>The isolation of qubits from noise sources, such as surrounding nuclear spins and spin&#8211;electric susceptibility, has enabled extensions of quantum coherence times in recent pivotal advances towards the concrete implementation of spin-based quantum computation. In fact, the possibility of achieving enhanced quantum coherence has been substantially doubted for nanostructures due to the characteristic high degree of background charge fluctuations. Still, a sizeable spin&#8211;electric coupling will be needed in realistic multiple-qubit systems to address single-spin and spin&#8211;spin manipulations. Here, we realize a single-electron spin qubit with an isotopically enriched phase coherence time (20 &#956;s) and fast electrical control speed (up to 30 MHz) mediated by extrinsic spin&#8211;electric coupling. Using rapid spin rotations, we reveal that the free-evolution dephasing is caused by charge noise&#8212;rather than conventional magnetic noise&#8212;as highlighted by a 1/f spectrum extended over seven decades of frequency. The qubit exhibits superior performance with single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.9% on average, offering a promising route to large-scale spin-qubit systems with fault-tolerant controllability.</p>",[],False,"[""Jun Yoneda"", ""Kenta Takeda"", ""Tomohiro Otsuka"", ""Takashi Nakajima"", ""Matthieu R.

letter,Thermoelectric spin voltage in graphene,"<p>In recent years, new spin-dependent thermal effects have been discovered in ferromagnets, stimulating a growing interest in spin caloritronics, a field that exploits the interaction between spin and heat currents. Amongst the most intriguing phenomena is the spin Seebeck effect, in which a thermal gradient gives rise to spin currents that are detected through the inverse spin Hall effect. Non-magnetic materials such as graphene are also relevant for spin caloritronics, thanks to efficient spin transport, energy-dependent carrier mobility and unique density of states. Here, we propose and demonstrate that a carrier thermal gradient in a graphene lateral spin valve can lead to a large increase of the spin voltage near to the graphene charge neutrality point. Such an increase results from a thermoelectric spin voltage, which is analogous to the voltage in a thermocouple and that can be enhanced by the presence of hot carriers generated by an applied current. These results could prove crucial to drive graphene spintronic devices and, in particular, to sustain pure spin signals with thermal gradients and to tune the remote spin accumulation by varying the spin-injection bias.</p>",[],False,"[""Juan F.

letter,Direct-current triboelectricity generation by a sliding Schottky nanocontact on MoS2 multilayers,"<p>The direct conversion of mechanical energy into electricity by nanomaterial-based devices offers potential for green energy harvesting. A conventional triboelectric nanogenerator converts frictional energy into electricity by producing alternating current (a.c.) triboelectricity. However, this approach is limited by low current density and the need for rectification. Here, we show that continuous direct-current (d.c.) with a maximum density of 10<sup>6</sup>&#8201;A&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> can be directly generated by a sliding Schottky nanocontact without the application of an external voltage. We demonstrate this by sliding a conductive-atomic force microscope tip on a thin film of molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>). Finite element simulation reveals that the anomalously high current density can be attributed to the non-equilibrium carrier transport phenomenon enhanced by the strong local electrical field (10<sup>5</sup>&#8722;10<sup>6</sup>&#8201;V&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) at the conductive nanoscale tip. We hypothesize that the charge transport may be induced by electronic excitation under friction, and the nanoscale current&#8722;voltage spectra analysis indicates that the rectifying Schottky barrier at the tip&#8211;sample interface plays a critical role in efficient d.c. energy harvesting. This concept is scalable when combined with microfabricated or contact surface modified electrodes, which makes it promising for efficient d.c. triboelectricity generation.</p>",[],False,"[""Jun Liu"", ""Ankur Goswami"", ""Keren Jiang"", ""Faheem Khan"", ""Seokbeom Kim"", ""Ryan McGee"", ""Zhi Li"", ""Zhiyu Hu"", ""Jungchul Lee"", ""Thomas Thundat""]","Liu, J., Goswami, A., Jiang, K. et al.

letter,Humidity-controlled rectification switching in ruthenium-complex molecular junctions,"<p>Although molecular rectifiers were proposed over four decades ago, until recently reported rectification ratios (RR) were rather moderate (RR ~ 10<sup>1</sup>). This ceiling was convincingly broken using a eutectic GaIn top contact to probe molecular monolayers of coupled ferrocene groups (RR ~ 10<sup>5</sup>), as well as using scanning tunnelling microscopy-break junctions and mechanically controlled break junctions to probe single molecules (RR ~ 10<sup>2</sup>&#8211;10<sup>3</sup>). Here, we demonstrate a device based on a molecular monolayer in which the RR can be switched by more than three orders of magnitude (between RR ~ 10<sup>0</sup> and RR &#8805; 10<sup>3</sup>) in response to humidity. As the relative humidity is toggled between 5% and 60%, the current&#8211;voltage (I&#8211;V) characteristics of a monolayer of di-nuclear Ru-complex molecules reversibly change from symmetric to strongly asymmetric (diode-like). Key to this behaviour is the presence of two localized molecular orbitals in series, which are nearly degenerate in dry circumstances but become misaligned under high humidity conditions, due to the displacement of counter ions (PF<sub>6</sub>
                <sup>&#8211;</sup>). This asymmetric gating of the two relevant localized molecular orbital levels results in humidity-controlled diode-like behaviour.</p>",[],False,"[""Huseyin Atesci"", ""Veerabhadrarao Kaliginedi"", ""Jose A.

letter,Peltier cooling in molecular junctions,"<p>The study of thermoelectricity in molecular junctions is of fundamental interest for the development of various technologies including cooling (refrigeration) and heat-to-electricity conversion. Recent experimental progress in probing the thermopower (Seebeck effect) of molecular junctions has enabled studies of the relationship between thermoelectricity and molecular structure. However, observations of Peltier cooling in molecular junctions&#8212;a critical step for establishing molecular-based refrigeration&#8212;have remained inaccessible. Here, we report direct experimental observations of Peltier cooling in molecular junctions. By integrating conducting-probe atomic force microscopy with custom-fabricated picowatt-resolution calorimetric microdevices, we created an experimental platform that enables the unified characterization of electrical, thermoelectric and energy dissipation characteristics of molecular junctions. Using this platform, we studied gold junctions with prototypical molecules (Au&#8211;biphenyl-4,4&#8242;-dithiol&#8211;Au, Au&#8211;terphenyl-4,4&#8242;&#8242;-dithiol&#8211;Au and Au&#8211;4,4&#8242;-bipyridine&#8211;Au) and revealed the relationship between heating or cooling and charge transmission characteristics. Our experimental conclusions are supported by self-energy-corrected density functional theory calculations. We expect these advances to stimulate studies of both thermal and thermoelectric transport in molecular junctions where the possibility of extraordinarily efficient energy conversion has been theoretically predicted.</p>",[],False,"[""Longji Cui"", ""Ruijiao Miao"", ""Kun Wang"", ""Dakotah Thompson"", ""Linda Angela Zotti"", ""Juan Carlos Cuevas"", ""Edgar Meyhofer"", ""Pramod Reddy""]","Cui, L., Miao, R., Wang, K. et al.

letter,Electrical control of charged carriers and excitons in atomically thin materials,"<p>Electrical confinement and manipulation of charge carriers in semiconducting nanostructures are essential for realizing functional quantum electronic devices. The unique band structure of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers a new route towards realizing novel 2D quantum electronic devices, such as valleytronic devices and valley&#8211;spin qubits. 2D TMDs also provide a platform for novel quantum optoelectronic devices due to their large exciton binding energy. However, controlled confinement and manipulation of electronic and excitonic excitations in TMD nanostructures have been technically challenging due to the prevailing disorder in the material, preventing accurate experimental control of local confinement and tunnel couplings. Here we demonstrate a novel method for creating high-quality heterostructures composed of atomically thin materials that allows for efficient electrical control of excitations. Specifically, we demonstrate quantum transport in the gate-defined, quantum-confined region, observing spin&#8211;valley locked quantized conductance in quantum point contacts. We also realize gate-controlled Coulomb blockade associated with confinement of electrons and demonstrate electrical control over charged excitons with tunable local confinement potentials and tunnel couplings.

article,Ultrahard carbon film from epitaxial two-layer graphene,"<p>Atomically thin graphene exhibits fascinating mechanical properties, although its hardness and transverse stiffness are inferior to those of diamond. So far, there has been no practical demonstration of the transformation of multilayer graphene into diamond-like ultrahard structures. Here we show that at room temperature and after nano-indentation, two-layer graphene on SiC(0001) exhibits a transverse stiffness and hardness comparable to diamond, is resistant to perforation with a diamond indenter and shows a reversible drop in electrical conductivity upon indentation. Density functional theory calculations suggest that, upon compression, the two-layer graphene film transforms into a diamond-like film, producing both elastic deformations and sp<sup>2</sup> to sp<sup>3</sup> chemical changes. Experiments and calculations show that this reversible phase change is not observed for a single buffer layer on SiC or graphene films thicker than three to five layers. Indeed, calculations show that whereas in two-layer graphene layer-stacking configuration controls the conformation of the diamond-like film, in a multilayer film it hinders the phase transformation.</p>",[],False,"[""Yang Gao"", ""Tengfei Cao"", ""Filippo Cellini"", ""Claire Berger"", ""Walter A. de Heer"", ""Erio Tosatti"", ""Elisa Riedo"", ""Angelo Bongiorno""]","Gao, Y., Cao, T., Cellini, F. et al.

Here, we report organic modifiers based on a paraffinic tripodal triptycene, which self-assembles into a completely oriented two-dimensional hexagonal triptycene array and one-dimensional layer stacking structure on polymer surfaces. Such few-layer films are analogous to conventional self-assembled monolayers on inorganic substrates in that they neutralize the polymer surface.

Lattice-misfit strain in atomically abrupt lateral heterojunctions, such as WSe<sub>2</sub>&#8211;MoS<sub>2</sub>, offers a new band-engineering strategy for tailoring their electronic properties.

Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we measure both the strain and the band alignment of the WSe<sub>2</sub>&#8211;MoS<sub>2</sub> lateral heterojunction. We find that the misfit strain induces type II to type I band alignment transformation. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals the dislocations at the interface that partially relieve the strain.

Such multicomponent systems are present in living cells and control the formation and break-up of a variety of supramolecular assemblies made of proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA in response to external stimuli; however, artificial counterparts are challenging to make. Here, we present a hybrid hydrogel consisting of a self-sorting double network of nanofibres in which each network responds to an applied external stimulus independent of the other. The hydrogel can be made to change its mechanical properties and rates of release of encapsulated proteins by adding Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or bacterial alkaline phosphatase. Notably, the properties of the gel depend on the order in which the external stimuli are applied. Multicomponent hydrogels comprising orthogonal stimulus-responsive supramolecular assemblies would be suitable for designing novel adaptive materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Hajime Shigemitsu"", ""Takahiro Fujisaku"", ""Wataru Tanaka"", ""Ryou Kubota"", ""Saori Minami"", ""Kenji Urayama"", ""Itaru Hamachi""]","Shigemitsu, H., Fujisaku, T., Tanaka, W. et al.
