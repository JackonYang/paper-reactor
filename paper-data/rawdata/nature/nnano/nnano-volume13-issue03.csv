letter,Ballistic Majorana nanowire devices,"<p>Majorana modes are zero-energy excitations of a topological superconductor that exhibit non-Abelian statistics. Following proposals for their detection in a semiconductor nanowire coupled to an s-wave superconductor, several tunnelling experiments reported characteristic Majorana signatures. Reducing disorder has been a prime challenge for these experiments because disorder can mimic the zero-energy signatures of Majoranas, and renders the topological properties inaccessible. Here, we show characteristic Majorana signatures in InSb nanowire devices exhibiting clear ballistic transport properties. Application of a magnetic field and spatial control of carrier density using local gates generates a zero bias peak that is rigid over a large region in the parameter space of chemical potential, Zeeman energy and tunnel barrier potential. The reduction of disorder allows us to resolve separate regions in the parameter space with and without a zero bias peak, indicating topologically distinct phases. These observations are consistent with the Majorana theory in a ballistic system, and exclude the known alternative explanations that invoke disorder or a nonuniform chemical potential.</p>",,"[{'address': 'QuTech and Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Önder Gül', ',\xa0Hao Zhang', ',\xa0Jouri D.

letter,Direct imaging of the electron liquid at oxide interfaces,"<p>The breaking of symmetry across an oxide heterostructure causes the electronic orbitals to be reconstructed at the interface into energy states that are different from their bulk counterparts. The detailed nature of the orbital reconstruction critically affects the spatial confinement and the physical properties of the electrons occupying the interfacial orbitals. Using an example of two-dimensional electron liquids forming at LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> interfaces with different crystal symmetry, we show that the selective orbital occupation and spatial quantum confinement of electrons can be resolved with subnanometre resolution using inline electron holography. For the standard (001) interface, the charge density map obtained by inline electron holography shows that the two-dimensional electron liquid is confined to the interface with narrow spatial extension (~1.0&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.3&#8201;nm in the half width). On the other hand, the two-dimensional electron liquid formed at the (111) interface shows a much broader spatial extension (~3.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.3&#8201;nm) with the maximum density located ~2.4&#8201;nm away from the interface, in excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Kyung Song', ',\xa0Bumsu Park', ',\xa0Ja Kyung Lee', ',\xa0Si-Young Choi', '\xa0&\xa0Sang Ho Oh']}, {'address': 'Materials Modeling and Characterization Department, Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS), Changwon, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Kyung Song', '\xa0&\xa0Si-Young Choi']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA', 'authors': ['Sangwoo Ryu', ',\xa0Hyungwoo Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Chang-Beom Eom']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy & Nebraska Center for Materials and Nanoscience, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE, USA', 'authors': ['Tula R.

letter,Manipulation of domain-wall solitons in bi- and trilayer graphene,"<p>Topological dislocations and stacking faults greatly affect the performance of functional crystalline materials. Layer-stacking domain walls (DWs) in graphene alter its electronic properties and give rise to fascinating new physics such as quantum valley Hall edge states. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to the engineering of dislocations to obtain materials with advanced properties. However, the manipulation of individual dislocations to precisely control the local structure and local properties of bulk material remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report the manipulation of individual layer-stacking DWs in bi- and trilayer graphene by means of a local mechanical force exerted by an atomic force microscope tip. We demonstrate experimentally the capability to move, erase and split individual DWs as well as annihilate or create closed-loop DWs. We further show that the DW motion is highly anisotropic, offering a simple approach to create solitons with designed atomic structures. Most artificially created DW structures are found to be stable at room temperature.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Lili Jiang', ',\xa0Sheng Wang', ',\xa0Chenhao Jin', ',\xa0M.

letter,Synthetic oligorotaxanes exert high forces when folding under mechanical load,"<p>Folding is a ubiquitous process that nature uses to control the conformations of its molecular machines, allowing them to perform chemical and mechanical tasks. Over the years, chemists have synthesized foldamers that adopt well-defined and stable folded architectures, mimicking the control expressed by natural systems. Mechanically interlocked molecules, such as rotaxanes and catenanes, are prototypical molecular machines that enable the controlled movement and positioning of their component parts. Recently, combining the exquisite complexity of these two classes of molecules, donor&#8211;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamers have been synthesized, in which interactions between the mechanically interlocked component parts dictate the single-molecule assembly into a folded secondary structure. Here we report on the mechanochemical properties of these molecules. We use atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy to mechanically unfold oligorotaxanes, made of oligomeric dumbbells incorporating 1,5-dioxynaphthalene units encircled by cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) rings. Real-time capture of fluctuations between unfolded and folded states reveals that the molecules exert forces of up to 50 pN against a mechanical load of up to 150 pN, and displays transition times of less than 10 &#956;s. While the folding is at least as fast as that observed in proteins, it is remarkably more robust, thanks to the mechanically interlocked structure. Our results show that synthetic oligorotaxanes have the potential to exceed the performance of natural folding proteins.</p>",,"[{'address': 'UR Molecular Systems, Department of Chemistry, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium', 'authors': ['Damien Sluysmans', ',\xa0Sandrine Hubert', '\xa0&\xa0Anne-Sophie Duwez']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Carson J.

letter,A modular platform for targeted RNAi therapeutics,"<p>Previous studies have identified relevant genes and signalling pathways that are hampered in human disorders as potential candidates for therapeutics. Developing nucleic acid-based tools to manipulate gene expression, such as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), opens up opportunities for personalized medicine. Yet, although major progress has been made in developing siRNA targeted delivery carriers, mainly by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for targeting, their clinical translation has not occurred. This is in part because of the massive development and production requirements and the high batch-to-batch variability of current technologies, which rely on chemical conjugation. Here we present a self-assembled modular platform that enables the construction of a theoretically unlimited repertoire of siRNA targeted carriers. The self-assembly of the platform is based on a membrane-anchored lipoprotein that is incorporated into siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles that interact with the antibody crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain. We show that a simple switch of eight different mAbs redirects the specific uptake of siRNAs by diverse leukocyte subsets in vivo. The therapeutic potential of the platform is demonstrated in an inflammatory bowel disease model by targeting colon macrophages to reduce inflammatory symptoms, and in a Mantle Cell Lymphoma xenograft model by targeting cancer cells to induce cell death and improve survival. This modular delivery platform represents a milestone in the development of precision medicine.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory of Precision NanoMedicine, School of Molecular Cell Biology and Biotechnology, George S.

article,A broadband achromatic metalens for focusing and imaging in the visible,"<p>A key goal of metalens research is to achieve wavefront shaping of light using optical elements with thicknesses on the order of the wavelength. Such miniaturization is expected to lead to compact, nanoscale optical devices with applications in cameras, lighting, displays and wearable optics. However, retaining functionality while reducing device size has proven particularly challenging. For example, so far there has been no demonstration of broadband achromatic metalenses covering the entire visible spectrum. Here, we show that by judicious design of nanofins on a surface, it is possible to simultaneously control the phase, group delay and group delay dispersion of light, thereby achieving a transmissive achromatic metalens with large bandwidth. We demonstrate diffraction-limited achromatic focusing and achromatic imaging from 470 to 670&#8201;nm. Our metalens comprises only a single layer of nanostructures whose thickness is on the order of the wavelength, and does not involve spatial multiplexing or cascading. While this initial design (numerical aperture of 0.2) has an efficiency of about 20% at 500&#8201;nm, we discuss ways in which our approach may be further optimized to meet the demand of future applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Harvard John A.

article,A broadband achromatic metalens in the visible,"<p>Metalenses consist of an array of optical nanoantennas on a surface capable of manipulating the properties of an incoming light wavefront. Various flat optical components, such as polarizers, optical imaging encoders, tunable phase modulators and a retroreflector, have been demonstrated using a metalens design. An open issue, especially problematic for colour imaging and display applications, is the correction of chromatic aberration, an intrinsic effect originating from the specific resonance and limited working bandwidth of each nanoantenna. As a result, no metalens has demonstrated full-colour imaging in the visible wavelength. Here, we show a design and fabrication that consists of GaN-based integrated-resonant unit elements to achieve an achromatic metalens operating in the entire visible region in transmission mode. The focal length of our metalenses remains unchanged as the incident wavelength is varied from 400 to 660&#8201;nm, demonstrating complete elimination of chromatic aberration at about 49% bandwidth of the central working wavelength. The average efficiency of a metalens with a numerical aperture of 0.106 is about 40% over the whole visible spectrum.

article,Electrical detection of single magnetic skyrmions in metallic multilayers at room temperature,"<p>Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected whirling spin textures that can be stabilized in magnetic materials by an asymmetric exchange interaction between neighbouring spins that imposes a fixed chirality.

To this aim, their contribution to the electrical transport properties of a device must be characterized&#8212;however, the existing demonstrations are limited to low temperatures and mainly in magnetic materials with a B20 crystal structure. Here we combine concomitant magnetic force microscopy and Hall resistivity measurements to demonstrate the electrical detection of sub-100 nm skyrmions in a multilayered thin film at room temperature. Furthermore, we detect and analyse the Hall signal of a single skyrmion, which indicates that it arises from the anomalous Hall effect with a negligible contribution from the topological Hall effect.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Unité Mixte de Physique, CNRS, Thales, Univ.

article,Fast water transport in graphene nanofluidic channels,"<p>Superfast water transport discovered in graphitic nanoconduits, including carbon nanotubes and graphene nanochannels, implicates crucial applications in separation processes and energy conversion. Yet lack of complete understanding at the single-conduit level limits development of new carbon nanofluidic structures and devices with desired transport properties for practical applications. Here, we show that the hydraulic resistance and slippage of single graphene nanochannels can be accurately determined using capillary flow and a novel hybrid nanochannel design without estimating the capillary pressure. Our results reveal that the slip length of graphene in the graphene nanochannels is around 16&#8201;nm, albeit with a large variation from 0 to 200&#8201;nm regardless of the channel height. We corroborate this finding with molecular dynamics simulation results, which indicate that&#160;this wide distribution of the slip length is due to the surface charge of graphene as well as the interaction between graphene and its silica substrate.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Quan Xie', ',\xa0Mohammad Amin Alibakhshi', '\xa0&\xa0Chuanhua Duan']}, {'address': 'Department of Engineering Mechanics and Center for Nano and Micro Mechanics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Shuping Jiao', '\xa0&\xa0Zhiping Xu']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Marek Hempel', '\xa0&\xa0Jing Kong']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Hyung Gyu Park']}]",False,"['Quan Xie', 'Mohammad Amin Alibakhshi', 'Shuping Jiao', 'Zhiping Xu', 'Marek Hempel', 'Jing Kong', 'Hyung Gyu Park', 'Chuanhua Duan']","Xie, Q., Alibakhshi, M.A., Jiao, S. et al.

article,Two-dimensional materials from high-throughput computational exfoliation of experimentally known compounds,"<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. Yet, only a few dozen 2D materials have been successfully synthesized or exfoliated. Here, we search for 2D materials that can be easily exfoliated from their parent compounds. Starting from 108,423 unique, experimentally known 3D compounds, we identify a subset of 5,619 compounds that appear layered according to robust geometric and bonding criteria. High-throughput calculations using van der Waals density functional theory, validated against experimental structural data and calculated random phase approximation binding energies, further allowed the identification of 1,825 compounds that are either easily or potentially exfoliable. In particular, the subset of 1,036 easily exfoliable cases provides novel structural prototypes and simple ternary compounds as well as a large portfolio of materials to search from for optimal properties. For a subset of 258 compounds, we explore vibrational, electronic, magnetic and topological properties, identifying 56 ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, including half-metals and half-semiconductors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Theory and Simulation of Materials (THEOS) and National Centre for Computational Design and Discovery of Novel Materials (MARVEL), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Nicolas Mounet', ',\xa0Marco Gibertini', ',\xa0Philippe Schwaller', ',\xa0Davide Campi', ',\xa0Andrius Merkys', ',\xa0Antimo Marrazzo', ',\xa0Thibault Sohier', ',\xa0Ivano Eligio Castelli', ',\xa0Andrea Cepellotti', ',\xa0Giovanni Pizzi', '\xa0&\xa0Nicola Marzari']}, {'address': 'Vilnius University Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius, Lithuania', 'authors': ['Andrius Merkys']}]",False,"['Nicolas Mounet', 'Marco Gibertini', 'Philippe Schwaller', 'Davide Campi', 'Andrius Merkys', 'Antimo Marrazzo', 'Thibault Sohier', 'Ivano Eligio Castelli', 'Andrea Cepellotti', 'Giovanni Pizzi', 'Nicola Marzari']","Mounet, N., Gibertini, M., Schwaller, P. et al.

article,Metagenomic analysis of microbial communities yields insight into impacts of nanoparticle design,"<p>Next-generation DNA sequencing and metagenomic analysis provide powerful tools for the environmentally friendly design of nanoparticles. Herein we demonstrate this approach using a model community of environmental microbes (that is, wastewater-activated sludge) dosed with gold nanoparticles of varying surface coatings and morphologies. Metagenomic analysis was highly sensitive in detecting the microbial community response to gold nanospheres and nanorods with either cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or polyacrylic acid surface coatings. We observed that the gold-nanoparticle morphology imposes a stronger force in shaping the microbial community structure than does the surface coating. Trends were consistent in terms of the compositions of both taxonomic and functional genes, which include antibiotic resistance genes, metal resistance genes and gene-transfer elements associated with cell stress that are relevant to public health. Given that nanoparticle morphology remained constant, the potential influence of gold dissolution was minimal. Surface coating governed the nanoparticle partitioning between the bioparticulate and aqueous phases.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Via Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science (ICTAS), Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA', 'authors': ['Jacob W.

article,Photoelectrochemical modulation of neuronal activity with free-standing coaxial silicon nanowires,"<p>Optical methods for modulating cellular behaviour are promising for both fundamental and clinical applications. However, most available methods are either mechanically invasive, require genetic manipulation of target cells or cannot provide subcellular specificity. Here, we address all these issues by showing optical neuromodulation with free-standing coaxial p-type/intrinsic/n-type silicon nanowires. We reveal the presence of atomic gold on the nanowire surfaces, likely due to gold diffusion during the material growth. To evaluate how surface gold impacts the photoelectrochemical properties of single nanowires, we used modified quartz pipettes from a patch clamp and recorded sustained cathodic photocurrents from single nanowires. We show that these currents can elicit action potentials in primary rat dorsal root ganglion neurons through a primarily atomic gold-enhanced photoelectrochemical process.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Medical Scientist Training Program, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Ramya Parameswaran']}, {'address': 'The Graduate Program in Biophysical Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Ramya Parameswaran']}, {'address': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['João L.
