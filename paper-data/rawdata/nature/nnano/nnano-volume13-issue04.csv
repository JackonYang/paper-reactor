letter,Strong room-temperature ferromagnetism in VSe2 monolayers on van der Waals substrates,"<p>Reduced dimensionality and interlayer coupling in van der Waals materials gives rise to fundamentally different electronic, optical and many-body quantum properties in monolayers compared with the bulk. This layer-dependence permits the discovery of novel material properties in the monolayer regime. Ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional materials is a coveted property that would allow fundamental studies of spin behaviour in low dimensions and enable new spintronics applications. Recent studies have shown that for the bulk-ferromagnetic layered materials CrI<sub>3</sub> (ref. ) and Cr<sub>2</sub>Ge<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub> (ref. ), ferromagnetic order is maintained down to the ultrathin limit at low temperatures. Contrary to these observations, we report the emergence of strong ferromagnetic ordering for monolayer VSe<sub>2</sub>, a material that is paramagnetic in the bulk. Importantly, the ferromagnetic ordering with a large magnetic moment persists to above room temperature, making VSe<sub>2</sub> an attractive material for van der Waals spintronics applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Manuel Bonilla"", ""Sadhu Kolekar"", ""Yujing Ma"", ""Horacio Coy Diaz"", ""Vijaysankar Kalappattil"", ""Raja Das"", ""Tatiana Eggers"", ""Humberto R.

letter,Spatially controlled doping of two-dimensional SnS2 through intercalation for electronics,"<p>Doped semiconductors are the most important building elements for modern electronic devices. In silicon-based integrated circuits, facile and controllable fabrication and integration of these materials can be realized without introducing a high-resistance interface. Besides, the emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials enables the realization of atomically thin integrated circuits. However, the 2D nature of these materials precludes the use of traditional ion implantation techniques for carrier doping and further hinders device development. Here, we demonstrate a solvent-based intercalation method to achieve p-type, n-type and degenerately doped semiconductors in the same parent material at the atomically thin limit. In contrast to naturally grown n-type S-vacancy SnS<sub>2</sub>, Cu intercalated bilayer SnS<sub>2</sub> obtained by this technique displays a hole field-effect mobility of ~40&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>&#8201;V<sup>&#8722;1&#8201;</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and the obtained Co-SnS<sub>2</sub> exhibits a metal-like behaviour with sheet resistance comparable to that of few-layer graphene. Combining this intercalation technique with lithography, an atomically seamless p&#8211;n&#8211;metal junction could be further realized with precise size and spatial control, which makes in-plane heterostructures practically applicable for integrated devices and other 2D materials. Therefore, the presented intercalation method can open a new avenue connecting the previously disparate worlds of integrated circuits and atomically thin materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Yongji Gong"", ""Hongtao Yuan"", ""Chun-Lan Wu"", ""Peizhe Tang"", ""Shi-Ze Yang"", ""Ankun Yang"", ""Guodong Li"", ""Bofei Liu"", ""Jorik van de Groep"", ""Mark L.

letter,Giant photoeffect in proton transport through graphene membranes,"<p>Graphene has recently been shown to be permeable to thermal protons, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms, which sparked interest in its use as a proton-conducting membrane in relevant technologies. However, the influence of light on proton permeation remains unknown. Here we report that proton transport through Pt-nanoparticle-decorated graphene can be enhanced strongly by illuminating it with visible light. Using electrical measurements and mass spectrometry, we find a photoresponsivity of &#8764;10<sup>4</sup>&#8201;A&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which translates into a gain of &#8764;10<sup>4</sup> protons per photon with response times in the microsecond range. These characteristics are competitive with those of state-of-the-art photodetectors that are based on electron transport using silicon and novel two-dimensional materials. The photo&#8211;proton effect could be important for graphene&#8217;s envisaged use in fuel cells and hydrogen isotope separation.

letter,Revolving supramolecular chiral structures powered by light in nanomotor-doped liquid crystals,"<p>Molecular machines operated by light have been recently shown to be able to produce oriented motion at the molecular scale as well as do macroscopic work when embedded in supramolecular structures. However, any supramolecular movement irremediably ceases as soon as the concentration of the interconverting molecular motors or switches reaches a photo-stationary state. To circumvent this limitation, researchers have typically relied on establishing oscillating illumination conditions&#8212;either by modulating the source intensity or by using bespoke illumination arrangements. In contrast, here we report a supramolecular system in which the emergence of oscillating patterns is encoded at the molecular level. Our system comprises chiral liquid crystal structures that revolve continuously when illuminated, under the action of embedded light-driven molecular motors. The rotation at the supramolecular level is sustained by the diffusion of the motors away from a localized illumination area. Above a critical irradiation power, we observe a spontaneous symmetry breaking that dictates the directionality of the supramolecular rotation. The interplay between the twist of the supramolecular structure and the diffusion of the chiral molecular motors creates continuous, regular and unidirectional rotation of the liquid crystal structure under non-equilibrium conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Tetiana Orlova"", ""Federico Lancia"", ""Charles Loussert"", ""Supitchaya Iamsaard"", ""Nathalie Katsonis"", ""Etienne Brasselet""]","Orlova, T., Lancia, F., Loussert, C. et al.

letter,Genetic programs can be compressed and autonomously decompressed in live cells,"<p>Fundamental computer science concepts have inspired novel information-processing molecular systems in test tubes and genetically encoded circuits in live cells. Recent research has shown that digital information storage in DNA, implemented using deep sequencing and conventional software, can approach the maximum Shannon information capacity of two bits per nucleotide. In nature,&#160;DNA is used to store genetic programs, but the information content of the&#160;encoding rarely approaches this maximum. We hypothesize that the biological function of a genetic program can be preserved while reducing the length of its DNA encoding&#160;and increasing the information content&#160;per nucleotide. Here we support this hypothesis by describing an experimental procedure for compressing a genetic program and its subsequent autonomous decompression and execution in human cells. As a test-bed we choose an RNAi cell classifier circuit that comprises redundant DNA sequences and is therefore amenable for compression, as are many other complex gene circuits. In one example, we implement a compressed encoding of a ten-gene four-input AND gate circuit using only four genetic constructs. The compression principles applied to gene circuits can enable fitting complex genetic programs into DNA delivery vehicles with limited cargo capacity, and storing compressed and biologically inert programs in vivo for on-demand activation.</p>",[],False,"[""Nicolas Lapique"", ""Yaakov Benenson""]","Lapique, N., Benenson, Y.

article,Charge splitters and charge transport junctions based on guanine quadruplexes,"<p>Self-assembling circuit elements, such as current splitters or combiners at the molecular scale, require the design of building blocks with three or more terminals. A promising material for such building blocks is DNA, wherein multiple strands can self-assemble into multi-ended junctions, and nucleobase stacks can transport charge over long distances. However, nucleobase stacking is often disrupted at junction points, hindering electric charge transport between the two terminals of the junction. Here, we show that a guanine-quadruplex (G4) motif can be used as a connector element for a multi-ended DNA junction. By attaching specific terminal groups to the motif, we demonstrate that charges can enter the structure from one terminal at one end of a three-way G4 motif, and can exit from one of two terminals at the other end with minimal carrier transport attenuation. Moreover, we study four-way G4 junction structures by performing theoretical calculations to assist in the design and optimization of these connectors.</p>",[],False,"[""Ruojie Sha"", ""Limin Xiang"", ""Chaoren Liu"", ""Alexander Balaeff"", ""Yuqi Zhang"", ""Peng Zhang"", ""Yueqi Li"", ""David N.

article,Transition from direct to inverted charge transport Marcus regions in molecular junctions via molecular orbital gating,"<p>Solid-state molecular tunnel junctions are often assumed to operate in the Landauer regime, which describes essentially activationless coherent tunnelling processes. In solution, on the other hand, charge transfer is described by Marcus theory, which accounts for thermally activated processes. In practice, however, thermally activated transport phenomena are frequently observed also in solid-state molecular junctions but remain poorly understood. Here, we show experimentally the transition from the Marcus to the inverted Marcus region in a solid-state molecular tunnel junction by means of intra-molecular orbital gating that can be tuned via the chemical structure of the molecule and applied bias. In the inverted Marcus region, charge transport is incoherent, yet virtually independent of temperature. Our experimental results fit well to a theoretical model that combines Landauer and Marcus theories and may have implications for the interpretation of temperature-dependent charge transport measurements in molecular junctions.</p>",[],False,"[""Li Yuan"", ""Lejia Wang"", ""Alvar R.

article,Confinement-induced liquid crystalline transitions in amyloid fibril cholesteric tactoids,"<p>Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and plays crucial roles in biology, medicine, physics and materials science. Understanding and controlling chirality is therefore an important research challenge with broad implications. Unlike other chiral colloids, such as nanocellulose or filamentous viruses, amyloid fibrils form nematic phases but appear to miss their twisted form, the cholesteric or chiral nematic phases, despite a well-defined chirality at the single fibril level. Here we report the discovery of cholesteric phases in amyloids, using &#946;-lactoglobulin fibrils shortened by shear stresses. The physical behaviour of these new cholesteric materials exhibits unprecedented structural complexity, with confinement-driven ordering transitions between at least three types of nematic and cholesteric tactoids. We use energy functional theory to rationalize these results and observe a chirality inversion from the left-handed amyloids to right-handed cholesteric droplets.

article,2D MoS2 as an efficient protective layer for lithium metal anodes in high-performance Li–S batteries,"<p>Among the candidates to replace Li-ion batteries, Li&#8211;S cells are an attractive option as their energy density is about five times higher (~2,600&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). The success of Li&#8211;S cells depends in large part on the utilization of metallic Li as anode material. Metallic lithium, however, is prone to grow parasitic dendrites and is highly reactive to several electrolytes; moreover, Li&#8211;S cells with metallic Li are also susceptible to polysulfides dissolution. Here, we show that ~10-nm-thick two-dimensional (2D) MoS<sub>2</sub> can act as a protective layer for Li-metal anodes, greatly improving the performances of Li&#8211;S batteries. In particular, we observe stable Li electrodeposition and the suppression of dendrite nucleation sites.

Here, we show that nanoporous carbon composite membranes, which comprise a layer of porous carbon fibre structures grown on a porous ceramic substrate, can exhibit 100% desalination and a freshwater flux that is 3&#8211;20 times higher than existing polymeric membranes. Thermal accounting experiments demonstrated that the carbon composite membrane saved over 80% of the latent heat consumption. Theoretical calculations combined with molecular dynamics simulations revealed the unique microscopic process occurring in the membrane. When the salt solution is stopped at the openings to the nanoscale porous channels and forms a meniscus, the vapour can rapidly transport across the nanoscale gap to condense on the permeate side. This process is driven by the chemical potential gradient and aided by the unique smoothness of the carbon surface. The high thermal conductivity of the carbon composite membrane ensures that most of the latent heat is recovered.</p>",[],False,"[""Wei Chen"", ""Shuyu Chen"", ""Tengfei Liang"", ""Qiang Zhang"", ""Zhongli Fan"", ""Hang Yin"", ""Kuo-Wei Huang"", ""Xixiang Zhang"", ""Zhiping Lai"", ""Ping Sheng""]","Chen, W., Chen, S., Liang, T. et al.
