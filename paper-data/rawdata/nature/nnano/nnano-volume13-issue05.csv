letter,Current polarity-dependent manipulation of antiferromagnetic domains,"<p>Antiferromagnets have several favourable properties as active elements in spintronic devices, including ultra-fast dynamics, zero stray fields and insensitivity to external magnetic fields. Tetragonal CuMnAs is a testbed system in which the antiferromagnetic order parameter can be switched reversibly at ambient conditions using electrical currents. In previous experiments, orthogonal in-plane current pulses were used to induce 90&#176; rotations of antiferromagnetic domains and demonstrate the operation of all-electrical memory bits in a multi-terminal geometry. Here, we demonstrate that antiferromagnetic domain walls can be manipulated to realize stable and reproducible domain changes using only two electrical contacts. This is achieved by using the polarity of the current to switch the sign of the current-induced effective field acting on the antiferromagnetic sublattices. The resulting reversible domain and domain wall reconfigurations are imaged using X-ray magnetic linear dichroism microscopy, and can also be detected electrically. Switching by domain-wall motion can occur at much lower current densities than those needed for coherent domain switching.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK', 'authors': ['Peter Wadley', ',\xa0Sonka Reimers', ',\xa0Carl Andrews', ',\xa0Mu Wang', ',\xa0Jasbinder S.

letter,Selective control of multiple ferroelectric switching pathways using a trailing flexoelectric field,"<p>Flexoelectricity is an electromechanical coupling between electrical polarization and a strain gradient that enables mechanical manipulation of polarization without applying an electrical bias. Recently, flexoelectricity was directly demonstrated by mechanically switching the out-of-plane polarization of a uniaxial system with a scanning probe microscope tip. However, the successful application of flexoelectricity in low-symmetry multiaxial ferroelectrics and therefore active manipulation of multiple domains via flexoelectricity have not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate that the symmetry-breaking flexoelectricity offers a powerful route for the selective control of multiple domain switching pathways in multiaxial ferroelectric materials. Specifically, we use a trailing flexoelectric field that is created by the motion of a mechanically loaded scanning probe microscope tip. By controlling the SPM scan direction, we can deterministically select either stable 71&#176; ferroelastic switching or 180&#176; ferroelectric switching in a multiferroic magnetoelectric BiFeO<sub>3</sub> thin film. Phase-field simulations reveal that the amplified in-plane trailing flexoelectric field is essential for this domain engineering. Moreover, we show that mechanically switched domains have a good retention property. This work opens a new avenue for the deterministic selection of nanoscale ferroelectric domains in low-symmetry materials for non-volatile magnetoelectric devices and multilevel data storage.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Correlated Electron Systems, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Sung Min Park', ',\xa0Saikat Das', '\xa0&\xa0Tae Won Noh']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Sung Min Park', ',\xa0Saikat Das', '\xa0&\xa0Tae Won Noh']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA', 'authors': ['Bo Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Long-Qing Chen']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics Education, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Seung Chul Chae']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Jin-Seok Chung']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Suwon, Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do, Korea', 'authors': ['Jong-Gul Yoon']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Sookmyung Women’s University, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Sang Mo Yang']}]",False,"['Sung Min Park', 'Bo Wang', 'Saikat Das', 'Seung Chul Chae', 'Jin-Seok Chung', 'Jong-Gul Yoon', 'Long-Qing Chen', 'Sang Mo Yang', 'Tae Won Noh']","Park, S.M., Wang, B., Das, S. et al.

letter,Quantitative assessment of intermolecular interactions by atomic force microscopy imaging using copper oxide tips,"<p>Atomic force microscopy is an impressive tool with which to directly resolve the bonding structure of organic compounds. The methodology usually involves chemical passivation of the probe-tip termination by attaching single molecules or atoms such as CO or Xe (refs ). However, these probe particles are only weakly connected to the metallic apex, which results in considerable dynamic deflection. This probe particle deflection leads to pronounced image distortions, systematic overestimation of bond lengths, and in some cases even spurious bond-like contrast features, thus inhibiting reliable data interpretation<sup>&#8211;</sup>. Recently, an alternative approach to tip passivation has been used in which slightly indenting a tip into oxidized copper substrates and subsequent contrast analysis allows for the verification of an oxygen-terminated Cu tip. Here we show that, due to the covalently bound configuration of the terminal oxygen atom, this copper oxide tip (CuOx tip) has a high structural stability, allowing not only a quantitative determination of individual bond lengths and access to bond order effects, but also reliable intermolecular bond characterization. In particular, by removing the previous limitations of flexible probe particles, we are able to provide conclusive experimental evidence for an unusual intermolecular N&#8211;Au&#8211;N three-centre bond. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CuOx tips allow the characterization of the strength and configuration of individual hydrogen bonds within a molecular assembly.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physikalisches Institut,  Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Münster, Germany', 'authors': ['Harry Mönig', ',\xa0Saeed Amirjalayer', ',\xa0Alexander Timmer', ',\xa0Lacheng Liu', ',\xa0Oscar Díaz Arado', ',\xa0Marvin Cnudde', ',\xa0Cristian Alejandro Strassert', '\xa0&\xa0Harald Fuchs']}, {'address': 'Center for Nanotechnology, Münster, Germany', 'authors': ['Harry Mönig', ',\xa0Saeed Amirjalayer', ',\xa0Alexander Timmer', ',\xa0Lacheng Liu', ',\xa0Oscar Díaz Arado', ',\xa0Marvin Cnudde', ',\xa0Cristian Alejandro Strassert', '\xa0&\xa0Harald Fuchs']}, {'address': 'Center for Joint Quantum Studies and Department of Physics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China', 'authors': ['Zhixin Hu']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Beijing Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Functional Materials & Micro-Nano Devices, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Wei Ji']}, {'address': 'Institut für Festkörpertheorie, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Münster, Germany', 'authors': ['Michael Rohlfing']}]",False,"['Harry Mönig', 'Saeed Amirjalayer', 'Alexander Timmer', 'Zhixin Hu', 'Lacheng Liu', 'Oscar Díaz Arado', 'Marvin Cnudde', 'Cristian Alejandro Strassert', 'Wei Ji', 'Michael Rohlfing', 'Harald Fuchs']","Mönig, H., Amirjalayer, S., Timmer, A. et al.

letter,Reorganization energy upon charging a single molecule on an insulator measured by atomic force microscopy,"<p>Intermolecular single-electron transfer on electrically insulating films is a key process in molecular electronics and an important example of a redox reaction. Electron-transfer rates in molecular systems depend on a few fundamental parameters, such as interadsorbate distance, temperature and, in particular, the Marcus reorganization energy. This crucial parameter is the energy gain that results from the distortion of the equilibrium nuclear geometry in the molecule and its environment on charging. The substrate, especially ionic films, can have an important influence on the reorganization energy. Reorganization energies are measured in electrochemistry as well as with optical and photoemission spectroscopies, but not at the single-molecule limit and nor on insulating surfaces. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), with single-charge sensitivity, atomic-scale spatial resolution and operable on insulating films, overcomes these challenges. Here, we investigate redox reactions of single naphthalocyanine (NPc) molecules on multilayered NaCl films. Employing the atomic force microscope as an ultralow current meter allows us to measure the differential conductance related to transitions between two charge states in both directions. Thereby, the reorganization energy of NPc on NaCl is determined as (0.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.2)&#8201;eV, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide the atomistic picture of the nuclear relaxations on charging. Our approach presents a route to perform tunnelling spectroscopy of single adsorbates on insulating substrates and provides insight into single-electron intermolecular transport.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Research – Zurich, Rüschlikon, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Shadi Fatayer', ',\xa0Bruno Schuler', ',\xa0Wolfram Steurer', ',\xa0Leo Gross', '\xa0&\xa0Gerhard Meyer']}, {'address': 'Surface Science Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK', 'authors': ['Ivan Scivetti', '\xa0&\xa0Mats Persson']}, {'address': 'Institute of Experimental and Applied Physics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Jascha Repp']}, {'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, Göteborg, Sweden', 'authors': ['Mats Persson']}]",False,"['Shadi Fatayer', 'Bruno Schuler', 'Wolfram Steurer', 'Ivan Scivetti', 'Jascha Repp', 'Leo Gross', 'Mats Persson', 'Gerhard Meyer']","Fatayer, S., Schuler, B., Steurer, W. et al.

letter,An artificial molecular machine that builds an asymmetric catalyst,"<p>Biomolecular machines perform types of complex molecular-level tasks that artificial molecular machines can aspire to. The ribosome, for example, translates information from the polymer track it traverses (messenger RNA) to the new polymer it constructs (a polypeptide). The sequence and number of codons read determines the sequence and number of building blocks incorporated into the biomachine-synthesized polymer. However, neither control of sequence nor the transfer of length information from one polymer to another (which to date has only been accomplished in man-made systems through template synthesis) is easily achieved in the synthesis of artificial macromolecules. Rotaxane-based molecular machines have been developed that successively add amino acids (including &#946;-amino acids) to a growing peptide chain by the action of a macrocycle moving along a mono-dispersed oligomeric track derivatized with amino-acid phenol esters. The threaded macrocycle picks up groups that block its path and links them through successive native chemical ligation reactions to form a peptide sequence corresponding to the order of the building blocks on the track. Here, we show that as an alternative to translating sequence information, a rotaxane molecular machine can transfer the narrow polydispersity of a leucine-ester-derivatized polystyrene chain synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization to a molecular-machine-made homo-leucine oligomer. The resulting narrow-molecular-weight oligomer folds to an &#945;-helical secondary structure that acts as an asymmetric catalyst for the Juli&#225;&#8211;Colonna epoxidation of chalcones.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Chemistry, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK', 'authors': ['Guillaume De Bo', ',\xa0Malcolm A.

letter,Kinesin expands and stabilizes the GDP-microtubule lattice,"<p>Kinesin-1 is a nanoscale molecular motor that walks towards the fast-growing (plus) ends of microtubules, hauling molecular cargo to specific reaction sites in cells. Kinesin-driven transport is central to the self-organization of eukaryotic cells and shows great promise as a tool for nano-engineering. Recent work hints that kinesin may also play a role in modulating the stability of its microtubule track, both in vitro and in vivo, but the results are conflicting and the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we report a new dimension to the kinesin&#8211;microtubule interaction, whereby strong-binding state (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-bound and apo) kinesin-1 motor domains inhibit the shrinkage of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) microtubules by up to two orders of magnitude and expand their lattice spacing by ~1.6%.

article,Large tunable valley splitting in edge-free graphene quantum dots on boron nitride,"<p>Coherent manipulation of the binary degrees of freedom is at the heart of modern quantum technologies. Graphene offers two binary degrees: the electron spin and the valley. Efficient spin control has been demonstrated in many solid-state systems, whereas exploitation of the valley has only recently been started, albeit without control at the single-electron level. Here, we show that van der Waals stacking of graphene onto hexagonal boron nitride offers a natural platform for valley control. We use a graphene quantum dot induced by the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope and demonstrate valley splitting that is tunable from &#8722;5 to +10&#8201;meV (including valley inversion) by sub-10-nm displacements of the quantum dot position. This boosts the range of controlled valley splitting by about one order of magnitude. The tunable inversion of spin and valley states should enable coherent superposition of these degrees of freedom as a first step towards graphene-based qubits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'II.

article,Spin–photon interface and spin-controlled photon switching in a nanobeam waveguide,"<p>The spin of an electron is a promising memory state and qubit. Connecting spin states that are spatially far apart will enable quantum nodes and quantum networks based on the electron spin. Towards this goal, an integrated spin&#8211;photon interface would be a major leap forward as it combines the memory capability of a single spin with the efficient transfer of information by photons. Here, we demonstrate such an efficient and optically programmable interface between the spin of an electron in a quantum dot and photons in a nanophotonic waveguide. The spin can be deterministically prepared in the ground state with a fidelity of up to 96%. Subsequently, the system is used to implement a single-spin photonic switch, in which the spin state of the electron directs the flow of photons through the waveguide. The spin&#8211;photon interface may enable on-chip photon&#8211;photon gates, single-photon transistors and the efficient generation of a photonic cluster state.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark', 'authors': ['Alisa Javadi', ',\xa0Dapeng Ding', ',\xa0Martin Hayhurst Appel', ',\xa0Sahand Mahmoodian', ',\xa0Camille Papon', ',\xa0Tommaso Pregnolato', ',\xa0Søren Stobbe', ',\xa0Leonardo Midolo', ',\xa0Tim Schröder', '\xa0&\xa0Peter Lodahl']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Matthias Christian Löbl', ',\xa0Immo Söllner', ',\xa0Arne Ludwig', '\xa0&\xa0Richard John Warburton']}, {'address': 'Lehrstuhl für Angewandte Festkörperphysik, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany', 'authors': ['Rüdiger Schott', '\xa0&\xa0Andreas Dirk Wieck']}]",False,"['Alisa Javadi', 'Dapeng Ding', 'Martin Hayhurst Appel', 'Sahand Mahmoodian', 'Matthias Christian Löbl', 'Immo Söllner', 'Rüdiger Schott', 'Camille Papon', 'Tommaso Pregnolato', 'Søren Stobbe', 'Leonardo Midolo', 'Tim Schröder', 'Andreas Dirk Wieck', 'Arne Ludwig', 'Richard John Warburton', 'Peter Lodahl']","Javadi, A., Ding, D., Appel, M.H. et al.

article,A semi-floating gate memory based on van der Waals heterostructures for quasi-non-volatile applications,"<p>As conventional circuits based on field-effect transistors are approaching their physical limits due to quantum phenomena, semi-floating gate transistors have emerged as an alternative ultrafast and silicon-compatible technology. Here, we show a quasi-non-volatile memory featuring a semi-floating gate architecture with band-engineered van der Waals heterostructures. This two-dimensional semi-floating gate memory demonstrates 156 times longer refresh time with respect to that of dynamic random access memory and ultrahigh-speed writing operations on nanosecond timescales. The semi-floating gate architecture greatly enhances the writing operation performance and is approximately 10<sup>6</sup> times faster than other memories based on two-dimensional materials. The demonstrated characteristics suggest that the quasi-non-volatile memory has the potential to bridge the gap between volatile and non-volatile memory technologies and decrease the power consumption required for frequent refresh operations, enabling a high-speed and low-power random access memory.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, School of Microelectronics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China', 'authors': ['Chunsen Liu', ',\xa0Xiao Yan', ',\xa0Xiongfei Song', ',\xa0Shijin Ding', ',\xa0David Wei Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Peng Zhou']}]",False,"['Chunsen Liu', 'Xiao Yan', 'Xiongfei Song', 'Shijin Ding', 'David Wei Zhang', 'Peng Zhou']","Liu, C., Yan, X., Song, X. et al.A semi-floating gate memory based on van der Waals heterostructures for quasi-non-volatile applications.

article,Synergetic interaction between neighbouring platinum monomers in CO2 hydrogenation,"<p>Exploring the interaction between two neighbouring monomers has great potential to significantly raise the performance and deepen the mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate that the synergetic interaction between neighbouring Pt monomers on MoS<sub>2</sub> greatly enhanced the CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation catalytic activity and reduced the activation energy relative to isolated monomers. Neighbouring Pt monomers were achieved by increasing the Pt mass loading up to 7.5% while maintaining the atomic dispersion of Pt. Mechanistic studies reveal that neighbouring Pt monomers not only worked in synergy to vary the reaction barrier, but also underwent distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers. Isolated Pt monomers favour the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into methanol without the formation of formic acid, whereas CO<sub>2</sub> is hydrogenated stepwise into formic acid and methanol for neighbouring Pt monomers. The discovery of the synergetic interaction between neighbouring monomers may create a new path for manipulating catalytic properties.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, Key Laboratory of Strongly-Coupled Quantum Matter Physics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China', 'authors': ['Hongliang Li', ',\xa0Liangbing Wang', ',\xa0Yizhou Dai', ',\xa0Zhengtian Pu', ',\xa0Zhuohan Lao', ',\xa0Yawei Chen', ',\xa0Menglin Wang', ',\xa0Xusheng Zheng', ',\xa0Junfa Zhu', ',\xa0Wenhua Zhang', ',\xa0Chao Ma', '\xa0&\xa0Jie Zeng']}, {'address': 'Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China', 'authors': ['Rui Si']}]",False,"['Hongliang Li', 'Liangbing Wang', 'Yizhou Dai', 'Zhengtian Pu', 'Zhuohan Lao', 'Yawei Chen', 'Menglin Wang', 'Xusheng Zheng', 'Junfa Zhu', 'Wenhua Zhang', 'Rui Si', 'Chao Ma', 'Jie Zeng']","Li, H., Wang, L., Dai, Y. et al.

article,Nanoparticles as multimodal photon transducers of ionizing radiation,"<p>In biomedical imaging, nanoparticles combined with radionuclides that generate Cerenkov luminescence are used in diagnostic imaging, photon-induced therapies and as activatable probes. In these applications, the nanoparticle is often viewed as a carrier inert to ionizing radiation from the radionuclide. However, certain phenomena such as enhanced nanoparticle luminescence and generation of reactive oxygen species cannot be completely explained by Cerenkov luminescence interactions with nanoparticles. Herein, we report methods to examine the mechanisms of nanoparticle excitation by radionuclides, including interactions with Cerenkov luminescence, &#946; particles and &#947; radiation. We demonstrate that &#946;-scintillation contributes appreciably to excitation and reactivity in certain nanoparticle systems, and that excitation by radionuclides of nanoparticles composed of large atomic number atoms generates X-rays, enabling multiplexed imaging through single photon emission computed tomography. These findings demonstrate practical optical imaging and therapy using radionuclides with emission energies below the Cerenkov threshold, thereby expanding the list of applicable radionuclides.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Graduate School, New York, NY, USA', 'authors': ['Edwin C.

article,Nanoparticle-induced neuronal toxicity across placental barriers is mediated by autophagy and dependent on astrocytes,"<p>The potential for maternal nanoparticle (NP) exposures to cause developmental toxicity in the fetus without the direct passage of NPs has previously been shown, but the mechanism remained elusive. We now demonstrate that exposure of cobalt and chromium NPs to BeWo cell barriers, an in vitro model of the human placenta, triggers impairment of the autophagic flux and release of interleukin-6. This contributes to the altered differentiation of human neural progenitor cells and DNA damage in the derived neurons and astrocytes. Crucially, neuronal DNA damage is mediated by astrocytes. Inhibiting the autophagic degradation in the BeWo barrier by overexpression of the dominant-negative human ATG4B<sup>C74A</sup> significantly reduces the levels of DNA damage in astrocytes. In vivo, indirect NP toxicity in mice results in neurodevelopmental abnormalities with reactive astrogliosis and increased DNA damage in the fetal hippocampus. Our results demonstrate the potential importance of autophagy to elicit NP toxicity and the risk of indirect developmental neurotoxicity after maternal NP exposure.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Regenerative Medicine Laboratory, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK', 'authors': ['Simon J.
