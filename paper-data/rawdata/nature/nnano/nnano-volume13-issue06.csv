letter,Experimental observation of chiral magnetic bobbers in B20-type FeGe,"<p>Chiral magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale vortex-like spin textures that form in the presence of an applied magnetic field in ferromagnets that support the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) because of strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry of the crystal. In sharp contrast to other systems that allow for the formation of a variety of two-dimensional (2D) skyrmions, in chiral magnets the presence of the DMI commonly prevents the stability and coexistence of topological excitations of different types. Recently, a new type of localized particle-like object&#8212;the chiral bobber (ChB)&#8212;was predicted theoretically in such materials. However, its existence has not yet been verified experimentally. Here, we report the direct observation of ChBs in thin films of B20-type FeGe by means of quantitative off-axis electron holography (EH). We identify the part of the temperature&#8211;magnetic field phase diagram in which ChBs exist and distinguish two mechanisms for their nucleation. Furthermore, we show that ChBs are able to coexist with skyrmions over a wide range of parameters, which suggests their possible practical applications in novel magnetic solid-state memory devices, in which a stream of binary data bits can be encoded by a sequence of skyrmions and bobbers.</p>",[],False,"[""Fengshan Zheng"", ""Filipp N.

letter,2D matrix engineering for homogeneous quantum dot coupling in photovoltaic solids,"<p>Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising photovoltaic (PV) materials because of their widely tunable absorption spectrum controlled by nanocrystal size. Their bandgap tunability allows not only the optimization of single-junction cells, but also the fabrication of multijunction cells that complement perovskites and silicon. Advances in surface passivation, combined with advances in device structures, have contributed to certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that rose to 11% in 2016. Further gains in performance are available if the thickness of the devices can be increased to maximize the light harvesting at a high fill factor (FF). However, at present the active layer thickness is limited to ~300&#8201;nm by the concomitant photocarrier diffusion length. To date, CQD devices thicker than this typically exhibit decreases in short-circuit current (J<sub>SC</sub>) and open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>), as seen in previous reports. Here, we report a matrix engineering strategy for CQD solids that significantly enhances the photocarrier diffusion length. We find that a hybrid inorganic&#8211;amine coordinating complex enables us to generate a high-quality two-dimensionally (2D) confined inorganic matrix that programmes internanoparticle spacing at the atomic scale. This strategy enables the reduction of structural and energetic disorder in the solid and concurrent improvements in the CQD packing density and uniformity. Consequently, planar devices with a nearly doubled active layer thicknesses (~600&#8201;nm) and record values of J<sub>SC</sub> (32&#8201;mA&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) are fabricated. The V<sub>OC</sub> improved as the current was increased. We demonstrate CQD solar cells with a certified record efficiency of 12%.</p>",[],False,"[""Jixian Xu"", ""Oleksandr Voznyy"", ""Mengxia Liu"", ""Ahmad R.

letter,Plasmon-induced carrier polarization in semiconductor nanocrystals,"<p>Spintronics and valleytronics are emerging quantum electronic technologies that rely on using electron spin and multiple extrema of the band structure (valleys), respectively, as additional degrees of freedom. There are also collective properties of electrons in semiconductor nanostructures that potentially could be exploited in multifunctional quantum devices. Specifically, plasmonic semiconductor nanocrystals offer an opportunity for interface-free coupling between a plasmon and an exciton. However, plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling in single-phase semiconductor nanocrystals remains challenging because confined plasmon oscillations are generally not resonant with excitonic transitions. Here, we demonstrate a robust electron polarization in degenerately doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals, enabled by non-resonant coupling of cyclotron magnetoplasmonic modes with the exciton at the Fermi level. Using magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that intrinsic plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling allows for the indirect excitation of the magnetoplasmonic modes, and subsequent Zeeman splitting of the excitonic states. Splitting of the band states and selective carrier polarization can be manipulated further by spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Our results effectively open up the field of plasmontronics, which involves the phenomena that arise from intrinsic plasmon&#8211;exciton and plasmon&#8211;spin interactions. Furthermore, the dynamic control of carrier polarization is readily achieved at room temperature, which allows us to harness the magnetoplasmonic mode as a new degree of freedom in practical photonic, optoelectronic and quantum-information processing devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Penghui Yin"", ""Yi Tan"", ""Hanbing Fang"", ""Manu Hegde"", ""Pavle V.

letter,Transport of hydrogen isotopes through interlayer spacing in van der Waals crystals,"<p>Atoms start behaving as waves rather than classical particles if confined in spaces commensurate with their de Broglie wavelength. At room temperature this length is only about one&#8201;&#229;ngstr&#246;m even for the lightest atom, hydrogen. This restricts quantum-confinement phenomena for atomic species to the realm of very low temperatures. Here, we show that van der Waals gaps between atomic planes of layered crystals provide &#229;ngstr&#246;m-size channels that make quantum confinement of protons apparent even at room temperature. Our transport measurements show that thermal protons experience a notably higher barrier than deuterons when entering van der Waals gaps in hexagonal boron nitride and molybdenum disulfide. This is attributed to the difference in the de Broglie wavelengths of the isotopes. Once inside the crystals, transport of both isotopes can be described by classical diffusion, albeit with unexpectedly fast rates comparable to that of protons in water. The demonstrated &#229;ngstr&#246;m-size channels can be exploited for further studies of atomistic quantum confinement and, if the technology can be scaled up, for sieving hydrogen isotopes.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

letter,Calcium-dependent molecular fMRI using a magnetic nanosensor,"<p>Calcium ions are ubiquitous signalling molecules in all multicellular organisms, where they mediate diverse aspects of intracellular and extracellular communication over widely varying temporal and spatial scales. Though techniques to map calcium-related activity at a high resolution by optical means are well established, there is currently no reliable method to measure calcium dynamics over large volumes in intact tissue. Here, we address this need by introducing a family of magnetic calcium-responsive nanoparticles (MaCaReNas) that can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MaCaReNas respond within seconds to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] changes in the 0.1&#8211;1.0&#8201;mM range, suitable for monitoring extracellular calcium signalling processes in the brain. We show that the probes permit the repeated detection of brain activation in response to diverse stimuli in vivo. MaCaReNas thus provide a tool for calcium-activity mapping in deep tissue and offer a precedent for the development of further nanoparticle-based sensors for dynamic molecular imaging with MRI.</p>",[],False,"[""Satoshi Okada"", ""Benjamin B.

letter,Superparamagnetic nickel colloidal nanocrystal clusters with antibacterial activity and bacteria binding ability,"<p>Recent progress in synthetic nanotechnology and the ancient use of metals in food preservation and the antibacterial treatment of wounds have prompted the development of nanometallic materials for antimicrobial applications. However, the materials designed so far do not simultaneously display antimicrobial activity and the capability of binding and capturing bacteria and spores. Here, we develop a one-step pyrolysis procedure to synthesize monodisperse superparamagnetic nickel colloidal nanocrystal clusters (SNCNCs), which show both antibacterial activity and the ability to bind Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria, as well as bacterial spores. The SNCNCs are formed from a rapid burst of nickel nanoparticles, which self-assemble slowly into clusters. The clusters can magnetically extract 99.99% of bacteria and spores and provide a promising approach for the removal of microbes, including hard-to-treat microorganisms. We believe that our work illustrates the exciting opportunities that nanotechnology offers for alternative antimicrobial strategies and other applications in microbiology.</p>",[],False,"[""Bo Peng"", ""Xinglin Zhang"", ""Dirk G.

article,Tunnelling spectroscopy of gate-induced superconductivity in MoS2,"<p>The ability to gate-induce superconductivity by electrostatic charge accumulation is a recent breakthrough in physics and nanoelectronics. With the exception of LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> interfaces, experiments on gate-induced superconductors have been largely confined to resistance measurements, which provide very limited information about the superconducting state. Here, we explore gate-induced superconductivity in MoS<sub>2</sub> by performing tunnelling spectroscopy to determine the energy-dependent density of states (DOS) for different levels of electron density n. In the superconducting state, the DOS is strongly suppressed at energy smaller than the gap &#916;, which is maximum (&#916;&#8201;~2&#8201;meV) for n of ~1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>14</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and decreases monotonously for larger n. A perpendicular magnetic field B generates states at E&#8201;&lt;&#8201;&#916; that fill the gap, but a 20% DOS suppression of superconducting origin unexpectedly persists much above the transport critical field. Conversely, an in-plane field up to 10&#8201;T leaves the DOS entirely unchanged. Our measurements exclude that the superconducting state in MoS<sub>2</sub> is fully gapped and reveal the presence of a DOS that vanishes linearly with energy, the explanation of which requires going beyond a conventional, purely phonon-driven Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer mechanism.</p>",[],False,"[""Davide Costanzo"", ""Haijing Zhang"", ""Bojja Aditya Reddy"", ""Helmuth Berger"", ""Alberto F.

article,Multifunctional biophotonic nanostructures inspired by the longtail glasswing butterfly for medical devices,"<p>Numerous living organisms possess biophotonic nanostructures that provide colouration and other diverse functions for survival. While such structures have been actively studied and replicated in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether they can be used for biomedical applications. Here, we show a transparent photonic nanostructure inspired by the longtail glasswing butterfly (Chorinea faunus) and demonstrate its use in intraocular pressure (IOP) sensors in vivo. We exploit the phase separation between two immiscible polymers (poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene) to form nanostructured features on top of a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> substrate. The membrane thus formed shows good angle-independent white-light transmission, strong hydrophilicity and anti-biofouling properties, which prevent adhesion of proteins, bacteria and eukaryotic cells. We then developed a microscale implantable IOP sensor using our photonic membrane as an optomechanical sensing element. Finally, we performed in vivo testing on New Zealand white rabbits, which showed that our device reduces the mean IOP measurement variation compared with conventional rebound tonometry without signs of inflammation.</p>",[],False,"[""Vinayak Narasimhan"", ""Radwanul Hasan Siddique"", ""Jeong Oen Lee"", ""Shailabh Kumar"", ""Blaise Ndjamen"", ""Juan Du"", ""Natalie Hong"", ""David Sretavan"", ""Hyuck Choo""]","Narasimhan, V., Siddique, R.H., Lee, J.O. et al.
