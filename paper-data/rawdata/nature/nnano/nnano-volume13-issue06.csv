letter,Experimental observation of chiral magnetic bobbers in B20-type FeGe,"<p>Chiral magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale vortex-like spin textures that form in the presence of an applied magnetic field in ferromagnets that support the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) because of strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry of the crystal. In sharp contrast to other systems that allow for the formation of a variety of two-dimensional (2D) skyrmions, in chiral magnets the presence of the DMI commonly prevents the stability and coexistence of topological excitations of different types. Recently, a new type of localized particle-like object&#8212;the chiral bobber (ChB)&#8212;was predicted theoretically in such materials. However, its existence has not yet been verified experimentally. Here, we report the direct observation of ChBs in thin films of B20-type FeGe by means of quantitative off-axis electron holography (EH). We identify the part of the temperature&#8211;magnetic field phase diagram in which ChBs exist and distinguish two mechanisms for their nucleation. Furthermore, we show that ChBs are able to coexist with skyrmions over a wide range of parameters, which suggests their possible practical applications in novel magnetic solid-state memory devices, in which a stream of binary data bits can be encoded by a sequence of skyrmions and bobbers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Ernst Ruska-Centre for Microscopy and Spectroscopy with Electrons and Peter Grünberg Institute, Forschungszentrum Jülich, Jülich, Germany', 'authors': ['Fengshan Zheng', ',\xa0Jan Caron', ',\xa0András Kovács', '\xa0&\xa0Rafal E.

letter,2D matrix engineering for homogeneous quantum dot coupling in photovoltaic solids,"<p>Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising photovoltaic (PV) materials because of their widely tunable absorption spectrum controlled by nanocrystal size. Their bandgap tunability allows not only the optimization of single-junction cells, but also the fabrication of multijunction cells that complement perovskites and silicon. Advances in surface passivation, combined with advances in device structures, have contributed to certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that rose to 11% in 2016. Further gains in performance are available if the thickness of the devices can be increased to maximize the light harvesting at a high fill factor (FF). However, at present the active layer thickness is limited to ~300&#8201;nm by the concomitant photocarrier diffusion length. To date, CQD devices thicker than this typically exhibit decreases in short-circuit current (J<sub>SC</sub>) and open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>), as seen in previous reports. Here, we report a matrix engineering strategy for CQD solids that significantly enhances the photocarrier diffusion length. We find that a hybrid inorganic&#8211;amine coordinating complex enables us to generate a high-quality two-dimensionally (2D) confined inorganic matrix that programmes internanoparticle spacing at the atomic scale. This strategy enables the reduction of structural and energetic disorder in the solid and concurrent improvements in the CQD packing density and uniformity. Consequently, planar devices with a nearly doubled active layer thicknesses (~600&#8201;nm) and record values of J<sub>SC</sub> (32&#8201;mA&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) are fabricated. The V<sub>OC</sub> improved as the current was increased. We demonstrate CQD solar cells with a certified record efficiency of 12%.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Jixian Xu', ',\xa0Oleksandr Voznyy', ',\xa0Mengxia Liu', ',\xa0Grant Walters', ',\xa0Andrew H.

letter,Plasmon-induced carrier polarization in semiconductor nanocrystals,"<p>Spintronics and valleytronics are emerging quantum electronic technologies that rely on using electron spin and multiple extrema of the band structure (valleys), respectively, as additional degrees of freedom. There are also collective properties of electrons in semiconductor nanostructures that potentially could be exploited in multifunctional quantum devices. Specifically, plasmonic semiconductor nanocrystals offer an opportunity for interface-free coupling between a plasmon and an exciton. However, plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling in single-phase semiconductor nanocrystals remains challenging because confined plasmon oscillations are generally not resonant with excitonic transitions. Here, we demonstrate a robust electron polarization in degenerately doped In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals, enabled by non-resonant coupling of cyclotron magnetoplasmonic modes with the exciton at the Fermi level. Using magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that intrinsic plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling allows for the indirect excitation of the magnetoplasmonic modes, and subsequent Zeeman splitting of the excitonic states. Splitting of the band states and selective carrier polarization can be manipulated further by spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Our results effectively open up the field of plasmontronics, which involves the phenomena that arise from intrinsic plasmon&#8211;exciton and plasmon&#8211;spin interactions. Furthermore, the dynamic control of carrier polarization is readily achieved at room temperature, which allows us to harness the magnetoplasmonic mode as a new degree of freedom in practical photonic, optoelectronic and quantum-information processing devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada', 'authors': ['Penghui Yin', ',\xa0Yi Tan', ',\xa0Hanbing Fang', ',\xa0Manu Hegde', '\xa0&\xa0Pavle V.

letter,Transport of hydrogen isotopes through interlayer spacing in van der Waals crystals,"<p>Atoms start behaving as waves rather than classical particles if confined in spaces commensurate with their de Broglie wavelength. At room temperature this length is only about one&#8201;&#229;ngstr&#246;m even for the lightest atom, hydrogen. This restricts quantum-confinement phenomena for atomic species to the realm of very low temperatures. Here, we show that van der Waals gaps between atomic planes of layered crystals provide &#229;ngstr&#246;m-size channels that make quantum confinement of protons apparent even at room temperature. Our transport measurements show that thermal protons experience a notably higher barrier than deuterons when entering van der Waals gaps in hexagonal boron nitride and molybdenum disulfide. This is attributed to the difference in the de Broglie wavelengths of the isotopes. Once inside the crystals, transport of both isotopes can be described by classical diffusion, albeit with unexpectedly fast rates comparable to that of protons in water. The demonstrated &#229;ngstr&#246;m-size channels can be exploited for further studies of atomistic quantum confinement and, if the technology can be scaled up, for sieving hydrogen isotopes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Graphene Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK', 'authors': ['S.

letter,Calcium-dependent molecular fMRI using a magnetic nanosensor,"<p>Calcium ions are ubiquitous signalling molecules in all multicellular organisms, where they mediate diverse aspects of intracellular and extracellular communication over widely varying temporal and spatial scales. Though techniques to map calcium-related activity at a high resolution by optical means are well established, there is currently no reliable method to measure calcium dynamics over large volumes in intact tissue. Here, we address this need by introducing a family of magnetic calcium-responsive nanoparticles (MaCaReNas) that can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MaCaReNas respond within seconds to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] changes in the 0.1&#8211;1.0&#8201;mM range, suitable for monitoring extracellular calcium signalling processes in the brain. We show that the probes permit the repeated detection of brain activation in response to diverse stimuli in vivo. MaCaReNas thus provide a tool for calcium-activity mapping in deep tissue and offer a precedent for the development of further nanoparticle-based sensors for dynamic molecular imaging with MRI.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Satoshi Okada', ',\xa0Benjamin B.

letter,Superparamagnetic nickel colloidal nanocrystal clusters with antibacterial activity and bacteria binding ability,"<p>Recent progress in synthetic nanotechnology and the ancient use of metals in food preservation and the antibacterial treatment of wounds have prompted the development of nanometallic materials for antimicrobial applications. However, the materials designed so far do not simultaneously display antimicrobial activity and the capability of binding and capturing bacteria and spores. Here, we develop a one-step pyrolysis procedure to synthesize monodisperse superparamagnetic nickel colloidal nanocrystal clusters (SNCNCs), which show both antibacterial activity and the ability to bind Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria, as well as bacterial spores. The SNCNCs are formed from a rapid burst of nickel nanoparticles, which self-assemble slowly into clusters. The clusters can magnetically extract 99.99% of bacteria and spores and provide a promising approach for the removal of microbes, including hard-to-treat microorganisms. We believe that our work illustrates the exciting opportunities that nanotechnology offers for alternative antimicrobial strategies and other applications in microbiology.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', 'authors': ['Bo Peng', ',\xa0Dirk G.

article,Tunnelling spectroscopy of gate-induced superconductivity in MoS2,"<p>The ability to gate-induce superconductivity by electrostatic charge accumulation is a recent breakthrough in physics and nanoelectronics. With the exception of LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> interfaces, experiments on gate-induced superconductors have been largely confined to resistance measurements, which provide very limited information about the superconducting state. Here, we explore gate-induced superconductivity in MoS<sub>2</sub> by performing tunnelling spectroscopy to determine the energy-dependent density of states (DOS) for different levels of electron density n. In the superconducting state, the DOS is strongly suppressed at energy smaller than the gap &#916;, which is maximum (&#916;&#8201;~2&#8201;meV) for n of ~1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>14</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and decreases monotonously for larger n. A perpendicular magnetic field B generates states at E&#8201;&lt;&#8201;&#916; that fill the gap, but a 20% DOS suppression of superconducting origin unexpectedly persists much above the transport critical field. Conversely, an in-plane field up to 10&#8201;T leaves the DOS entirely unchanged. Our measurements exclude that the superconducting state in MoS<sub>2</sub> is fully gapped and reveal the presence of a DOS that vanishes linearly with energy, the explanation of which requires going beyond a conventional, purely phonon-driven Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer mechanism.</p>",,"[{'address': 'DQMP and GAP, Université de Genève, Geneva, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Davide Costanzo', ',\xa0Haijing Zhang', ',\xa0Bojja Aditya Reddy', '\xa0&\xa0Alberto F.

article,Highly efficient solar vapour generation via hierarchically nanostructured gels,"<p>Solar vapour generation is an efficient way of harvesting solar energy for the purification of polluted or saline water. However, water evaporation suffers from either inefficient utilization of solar energy or relies on complex and expensive light-concentration accessories. Here, we demonstrate a hierarchically nanostructured gel (HNG) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polypyrrole (PPy) that serves as an independent solar vapour generator. The converted energy can be utilized in situ to power the vaporization of water contained in the molecular meshes of the PVA network, where water evaporation is facilitated by the skeleton of the hydrogel. A floating HNG sample evaporated water with a record high rate of 3.2&#8201;kg&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#8201;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup> via 94% solar energy from 1&#8201;sun irradiation, and 18&#8211;23 litres of water per square metre of HNG was delivered daily when purifying brine water.

article,A bio-hybrid DNA rotor–stator nanoengine that moves along predefined tracks,"<p>Biological motors are highly complex protein assemblies that generate linear or rotary motion, powered by chemical energy. Synthetic motors based on DNA nanostructures, bio-hybrid designs or synthetic organic chemistry have been assembled. However, unidirectionally rotating biomimetic wheel motors with rotor&#8211;stator units that consume chemical energy are elusive. Here, we report a bio-hybrid nanoengine consisting of a catalytic stator that unidirectionally rotates an interlocked DNA wheel, powered by NTP hydrolysis. The engine consists of an engineered T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP-ZIF) attached to a dsDNA nanoring that is catenated to a rigid rotating dsDNA wheel. The wheel motor produces long, repetitive RNA transcripts that remain attached to the engine and are used to guide its movement along predefined ssDNA tracks arranged on a DNA nanotube. The simplicity of the design renders this walking nanoengine adaptable to other biological nanoarchitectures, facilitating the construction of complex bio-hybrid structures that achieve NTP-driven locomotion.</p>",,"[{'address': 'LIMES Program Unit Chemical Biology & Medicinal Chemistry, c/o Kekulé Institut für Organische Chemie und Biochemie, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany', 'authors': ['Julián Valero', '\xa0&\xa0Michael Famulok']}, {'address': 'Center of Advanced European Studies and Research (CAESAR), Bonn, Germany', 'authors': ['Julián Valero', '\xa0&\xa0Michael Famulok']}, {'address': 'Single Molecule Analysis Group, Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA', 'authors': ['Nibedita Pal', ',\xa0Soma Dhakal', '\xa0&\xa0Nils G.

article,"Non-invasive, transdermal, path-selective and specific glucose monitoring via a graphene-based platform","<p>Currently, there is no available needle-free approach for diabetics to monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid. Here, we report a path-selective, non-invasive, transdermal glucose monitoring system based on a miniaturized pixel array platform (realized either by graphene-based thin-film technology, or screen-printing). The system samples glucose from the interstitial fluid via electroosmotic extraction through individual, privileged, follicular pathways in the skin, accessible via the pixels of the array. A proof of principle using mammalian skin ex vivo is demonstrated for specific and &#8216;quantized&#8217; glucose extraction/detection via follicular pathways, and across the hypo- to hyper-glycaemic range in humans. Furthermore, the quantification of follicular and non-follicular glucose extraction fluxes is clearly shown. In vivo continuous monitoring of interstitial fluid-borne glucose with the pixel array was able to track blood sugar in healthy human subjects. This approach paves the way to clinically relevant glucose detection in diabetics without the need for invasive, finger-stick blood sampling.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Bath, Bath, UK', 'authors': ['Luca Lipani', ',\xa0Bertrand G.

article,Multifunctional biophotonic nanostructures inspired by the longtail glasswing butterfly for medical devices,"<p>Numerous living organisms possess biophotonic nanostructures that provide colouration and other diverse functions for survival. While such structures have been actively studied and replicated in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether they can be used for biomedical applications. Here, we show a transparent photonic nanostructure inspired by the longtail glasswing butterfly (Chorinea faunus) and demonstrate its use in intraocular pressure (IOP) sensors in vivo. We exploit the phase separation between two immiscible polymers (poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene) to form nanostructured features on top of a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> substrate. The membrane thus formed shows good angle-independent white-light transmission, strong hydrophilicity and anti-biofouling properties, which prevent adhesion of proteins, bacteria and eukaryotic cells. We then developed a microscale implantable IOP sensor using our photonic membrane as an optomechanical sensing element. Finally, we performed in vivo testing on New Zealand white rabbits, which showed that our device reduces the mean IOP measurement variation compared with conventional rebound tonometry without signs of inflammation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Medical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Vinayak Narasimhan', ',\xa0Radwanul Hasan Siddique', ',\xa0Jeong Oen Lee', ',\xa0Shailabh Kumar', ',\xa0Blaise Ndjamen', ',\xa0Natalie Hong', '\xa0&\xa0Hyuck Choo']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Jeong Oen Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Hyuck Choo']}, {'address': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Juan Du', '\xa0&\xa0David Sretavan']}]",False,"['Vinayak Narasimhan', 'Radwanul Hasan Siddique', 'Jeong Oen Lee', 'Shailabh Kumar', 'Blaise Ndjamen', 'Juan Du', 'Natalie Hong', 'David Sretavan', 'Hyuck Choo']","Narasimhan, V., Siddique, R.H., Lee, J.O. et al.
