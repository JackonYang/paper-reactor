letter,Electrical control of 2D magnetism in bilayer CrI3,"<p>Controlling magnetism via electric fields addresses fundamental questions of magnetic phenomena and phase transitions, and enables the development of electrically coupled spintronic devices, such as voltage-controlled magnetic memories with low operation energy. Previous studies on dilute magnetic semiconductors such as (Ga,Mn)As and (In,Mn)Sb have demonstrated large modulations of the Curie temperatures and coercive fields by altering the magnetic anisotropy and exchange interaction. Owing to their unique magnetic properties, the recently reported two-dimensional magnets provide a new system for studying these features. For instance, a bilayer of chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) behaves as a layered antiferromagnet with a magnetic field-driven metamagnetic transition. Here, we demonstrate electrostatic gate control of magnetism in CrI<sub>3</sub> bilayers, probed by magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy. At fixed magnetic fields near the metamagnetic transition, we realize voltage-controlled switching between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. At zero magnetic field, we demonstrate a time-reversal pair of layered antiferromagnetic states that exhibit spin-layer locking, leading to a linear dependence of their MOKE signals on gate voltage with opposite slopes. Our results allow for the exploration of new magnetoelectric phenomena and van der Waals spintronics based on 2D materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Bevin Huang"", ""Genevieve Clark"", ""Dahlia R.

letter,Controlling magnetism in 2D CrI3 by electrostatic doping,"<p>The atomic thickness of two-dimensional materials provides a unique opportunity to control their electrical and optical properties as well as to drive the electronic phase transitions by electrostatic doping. The discovery of two-dimensional magnetic materials has opened up the prospect of the electrical control of magnetism and the realization of new functional devices. A recent experiment based on the linear magneto-electric effect has demonstrated control of the magnetic order in bilayer CrI<sub>3</sub> by electric fields. However, this approach is limited to non-centrosymmetric materials magnetically biased near the antiferromagnet&#8211;ferromagnet transition. Here, we demonstrate control of the magnetic properties of both monolayer and bilayer CrI<sub>3</sub> by electrostatic doping using CrI<sub>3</sub>&#8211;graphene vertical heterostructures. In monolayer CrI<sub>3</sub>, doping significantly modifies the saturation magnetization, coercive force and Curie temperature, showing strengthened/weakened magnetic order with hole/electron doping. Remarkably, in bilayer CrI<sub>3</sub>, the electron doping above ~2.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>13</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> induces a transition from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic ground state in the absence of a magnetic field.

letter,Electric-field control of magnetism in a few-layered van der Waals ferromagnetic semiconductor,"<p>Manipulating a quantum state via electrostatic gating has been of great importance for many model systems in nanoelectronics. Until now, however, controlling the electron spins or, more specifically, the magnetism of a system by electric-field tuning has proven challenging. Recently, atomically thin magnetic semiconductors have attracted significant attention due to their emerging new physical phenomena. However, many issues are yet to be resolved to convincingly demonstrate gate-controllable magnetism in these two-dimensional materials. Here, we show that, via electrostatic gating, a strong field effect can be observed in devices based on few-layered ferromagnetic semiconducting Cr<sub>2</sub>Ge<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>. At different gate doping, micro-area Kerr measurements in the studied devices demonstrate bipolar tunable magnetization loops below the Curie temperature, which is tentatively attributed to the moment rebalance in the spin-polarized band structure.

letter,Switchable geometric frustration in an artificial-spin-ice–superconductor heterosystem,"<p>Geometric frustration emerges when local interaction energies in an ordered lattice structure cannot be simultaneously minimized, resulting in a large number of degenerate states. The numerous degenerate configurations may lead to practical applications in microelectronics, such as data storage, memory and logic. However, it is difficult to achieve very high degeneracy, especially in a two-dimensional system. Here, we showcase in situ controllable geometric frustration with high degeneracy in a two-dimensional flux-quantum system. We create this in a superconducting thin film placed underneath a reconfigurable artificial-spin-ice structure. The tunable magnetic charges in the artificial-spin-ice strongly interact with the flux quanta in the superconductor, enabling switching between frustrated and crystallized flux quanta states. The different states have measurable effects on the superconducting critical current profile, which can be reconfigured by precise selection of the spin-ice magnetic state through the application of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate the applicability of these effects by realizing a reprogrammable flux quanta diode. The tailoring of the energy landscape of interacting &#8216;particles&#8217; using artificial-spin-ices provides a new paradigm for the design of geometric frustration, which could illuminate a path to control new functionalities in other material systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, electrons and holes in two-dimensional materials, and topological insulators, as well as colloids in soft materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Yong-Lei Wang"", ""Xiaoyu Ma"", ""Jing Xu"", ""Zhi-Li Xiao"", ""Alexey Snezhko"", ""Ralu Divan"", ""Leonidas E.

letter,Band structure engineering of 2D materials using patterned dielectric superlattices,"<p>The ability to manipulate electrons in two-dimensional materials with external electric fields provides a route to synthetic band engineering. By imposing artificially designed and spatially periodic superlattice potentials, electronic properties can be further altered beyond the constraints of naturally occurring atomic crystals. Here, we report a new approach to fabricate high-mobility superlattice devices by integrating surface dielectric patterning with atomically thin van der Waals materials. By separating the device assembly and superlattice fabrication processes, we address the intractable trade-off between device processing and mobility degradation that constrains superlattice engineering in conventional systems. The improved electrostatics of atomically thin materials allows smaller wavelength superlattice patterns relative to previous demonstrations. Moreover, we observe the formation of replica Dirac cones in ballistic graphene devices with sub-40&#8201;nm wavelength superlattices and report fractal Hofstadter spectra under large magnetic fields from superlattices with designed lattice symmetries that differ from that of the host crystal.

letter,Continuous-wave upconverting nanoparticle microlasers,"<p>Reducing the size of lasers to microscale dimensions enables new technologies that are specifically tailored for operation in confined spaces ranging from ultra-high-speed microprocessors to live brain tissue. However, reduced cavity sizes increase optical losses and require greater input powers to reach lasing thresholds. Multiphoton-pumped lasers that have been miniaturized using nanomaterials such as lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) as lasing media require high pump intensities to achieve ultraviolet and visible emission and therefore operate under pulsed excitation schemes. Here, we make use of the recently described energy-looping excitation mechanism in Tm<sup>3+</sup>-doped UCNPs to achieve continuous-wave upconverted lasing action in stand-alone microcavities at excitation fluences as low as 14&#8201;kW&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. Continuous-wave lasing is uninterrupted, maximizing signal and enabling modulation of optical interactions. By coupling energy-looping nanoparticles to whispering-gallery modes of polystyrene microspheres, we induce stable lasing for more than 5&#8201;h at blue and near-infrared wavelengths simultaneously. These microcavities are excited in the biologically transmissive second near-infrared (NIR-II) window and are small enough to be embedded in organisms, tissues or devices. The ability to produce continuous-wave lasing in microcavities immersed in blood serum highlights practical applications of these microscale lasers for sensing and illumination in complex biological environments.</p>",[],False,"[""Angel Fernandez-Bravo"", ""Kaiyuan Yao"", ""Edward S.

Progress has been made, but significant barriers need to be overcome such as the need for intense fields, the lack of versatility in operating conditions and the limited functionality in solutions of high ionic strength for biological applications. Here, we demonstrate switchable electrokinetic nanovalving able to confine and guide single nano-objects, including macromolecules, with sizes down to around 10 nanometres, in a lab-on-chip environment. The nanovalves are based on spatiotemporal tailoring of the potential energy landscape of nano-objects using an electric field, modulated collaboratively by wall nanotopography and by embedded electrodes in a nanochannel system. We combine nanovalves to isolate single entities from an ensemble, and demonstrate their guiding, confining, releasing and sorting. We show on-demand motion control of single immunoglobulin G molecules, quantum dots, adenoviruses, lipid vesicles, dielectric and metallic particles, suspended in electrolytes with a broad range of ionic strengths, up to biological levels.

article,Carbon nanotube bundles with tensile strength over 80 GPa,"<p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the strongest known materials. When assembled into fibres, however, their strength becomes impaired by defects, impurities, random orientations and discontinuous lengths. Fabricating CNT fibres with strength reaching that of a single CNT has been an enduring challenge. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of CNT bundles (CNTBs) that are centimetres long with tensile strength over 80&#8201;GPa using ultralong defect-free CNTs. The tensile strength of CNTBs is controlled by the Daniels effect owing to the non-uniformity of the initial strains in the components. We propose a synchronous tightening and relaxing strategy to release these non-uniform initial strains. The fabricated CNTBs, consisting of a large number of components with parallel alignment, defect-free structures, continuous lengths and uniform initial strains, exhibit a tensile strength of 80&#8201;GPa (corresponding to an engineering tensile strength of 43&#8201;GPa), which is far higher than that of any other strong fibre.</p>",[],False,"[""Yunxiang Bai"", ""Rufan Zhang"", ""Xuan Ye"", ""Zhenxing Zhu"", ""Huanhuan Xie"", ""Boyuan Shen"", ""Dali Cai"", ""Bofei Liu"", ""Chenxi Zhang"", ""Zhao Jia"", ""Shenli Zhang"", ""Xide Li"", ""Fei Wei""]","Bai, Y., Zhang, R., Ye, X. et al.

However, the electronic readout becomes a major challenge when the measurement basis scales to large numbers of spatial modes. Here, we address this problem by introducing a two-terminal coincidence detector that enables scalable readout of an array of detector segments based on superconducting nanowire microstrip transmission line. Exploiting timing logic, we demonstrate a sixteen-element detector that resolves all 136 possible single-photon and two-photon coincidence events. We further explore the pulse shapes of the detector output and resolve up to four-photon events in a four-element device, giving the detector photon-number-resolving capability.

article,Exfoliation of a non-van der Waals material from iron ore hematite,"<p>With the advent of graphene, the most studied of all two-dimensional materials, many inorganic analogues have been synthesized and are being exploited for novel applications. Several approaches have been used to obtain large-grain, high-quality materials. Naturally occurring ores, for example, are the best precursors for obtaining highly ordered and large-grain atomic layers by exfoliation. Here, we demonstrate a new two-dimensional material &#8216;hematene&#8217; obtained from natural iron ore hematite (&#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), which is isolated by means of liquid exfoliation. The two-dimensional morphology of hematene is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Magnetic measurements together with density functional theory calculations confirm the ferromagnetic order in hematene while its parent form exhibits antiferromagnetic order. When loaded on titania nanotube arrays, hematene exhibits enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity. Our study indicates that photogenerated electrons can be transferred from hematene to titania despite a band alignment unfavourable for charge transfer.</p>",[],False,"[""Aravind Puthirath Balan"", ""Sruthi Radhakrishnan"", ""Cristiano F.

article,Full control of ligand positioning reveals spatial thresholds for T cell receptor triggering,"<p>Elucidating the rules for receptor triggering in cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;matrix contacts requires precise control of ligand positioning in three dimensions. Here, we use the T cell receptor (TCR) as a model and subject T cells to different geometric arrangements of ligands, using a nanofabricated single-molecule array platform. This comprises monovalent TCR ligands anchored to lithographically patterned nanoparticle clusters surrounded by mobile adhesion molecules on a supported lipid bilayer. The TCR ligand could be co-planar with the supported lipid bilayer (2D), excluding the CD45 transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, or elevated by 10&#8201;nm on solid nanopedestals (3D), allowing closer access of CD45 to engaged TCR. The two configurations resulted in different T cell responses, depending on the lateral spacing between the ligands. These results identify the important contributions of lateral and axial components of ligand positioning and create a more complete foundation for receptor engineering for immunotherapy.</p>",[],False,"[""Haogang Cai"", ""James Muller"", ""David Depoil"", ""Viveka Mayya"", ""Michael P.
