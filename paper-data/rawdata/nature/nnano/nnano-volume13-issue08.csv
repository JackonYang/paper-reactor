review article,Low risk posed by engineered and incidental nanoparticles in drinking water,"<p>Natural nanoparticles (NNPs) in rivers, lakes, oceans and ground water predate humans, but engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are emerging as potential pollutants due to increasing regulatory and public perception concerns. This Review contrasts the sources, composition and potential occurrence of NNPs (for example, two-dimensional clays, multifunctional viruses and metal oxides) and ENPs in surface water, after centralized drinking water treatment, and in tap water. While analytical detection challenges exist, ENPs are currently orders of magnitude less common than NNPs in waters that flow into drinking water treatment plants. Because such plants are designed to remove small-sized NNPs, they are also very good at removing ENPs. Consequently, ENP concentrations in tap water are extremely low and pose low risk during ingestion. However, after leaving drinking water treatment plants, corrosion by-products released from distribution pipes or in-home premise plumbing can release incidental nanoparticles into tap water. The occurrence and toxicity of incidental nanoparticles, rather than ENPs, should therefore be the focus of future research.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology-Enabled Water Treatment, School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA', 'authors': ['Paul Westerhoff', '\xa0&\xa0Ariel Atkinson']}, {'address': 'Department of Energy, Environmental and Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA', 'authors': ['John Fortner']}, {'address': 'Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology-Enabled Water Treatment, Department of Chemical Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA', 'authors': ['Michael S.

analysis,A critical evaluation of nanopesticides and nanofertilizers against their conventional analogues,"<p>Among a wide range of possible applications of nanotechnology in agriculture, there has been a particular interest in developing novel nanoagrochemicals. While some concerns have been expressed regarding altered risk profile of the new products, many foresee a great potential to support the necessary increase in global food production in a sustainable way. A critical evaluation of nanoagrochemicals against conventional analogues is essential to assess the associated benefits and risks. In this assessment, recent literature was critically analysed to determine the extent to which nanoagrochemicals differ from conventional products. Our analysis was based on 78 published papers and shows that median gain in efficacy relative to conventional products is about 20&#8211;30%. Environmental fate of agrochemicals can be altered by nanoformulations, but changes may not necessarily translate in a reduction of the environmental impact. Many studies lacked nano-specific quality assurance and adequate controls. Currently, there is no comprehensive study in the literature that evaluates efficacy and environmental impact of nanoagrochemicals under field conditions. This is a crucial knowledge gap and more work will thus be necessary for a sound evaluation of the benefits and new risks that nanoagrochemicals represent relative to existing products.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Environmental Geosciences and Environmental Science Research Network, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria', 'authors': ['Melanie Kah']}, {'address': 'Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Land and Water, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia', 'authors': ['Melanie Kah', '\xa0&\xa0Rai Singh Kookana']}, {'address': 'Eawag, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, Dübendorf, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Alexander Gogos']}, {'address': 'Environmental Analytics, Agroscope, Zürich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Thomas Daniel Bucheli']}]",False,"['Melanie Kah', 'Rai Singh Kookana', 'Alexander Gogos', 'Thomas Daniel Bucheli']","Kah, M., Kookana, R.S., Gogos, A. et al.A critical evaluation of nanopesticides and nanofertilizers against their conventional analogues.

letter,Low-voltage electrostatic modulation of ion diffusion through layered graphene-based nanoporous membranes,"<p>Ion transport in nanoconfinement differs from that in bulk and has been extensively researched across scientific and engineering disciplines. For many energy and water applications of nanoporous materials, concentration-driven ion diffusion is simultaneously subjected to a local electric field arising from surface charge or an externally applied potential. Due to the uniquely crowded intermolecular forces under severe nanoconfinement (&lt;2&#8201;nm), the transport behaviours of ions can be influenced by the interfacial electrical double layer (EDL) induced by a surface potential, with complex implications, engendering unusual ion dynamics. However, it remains an experimental challenge to investigate how such a surface potential and its coupling with nanoconfinement manipulate ion diffusion. Here, we exploit the tunable nanoconfinement in layered graphene-based nanoporous membranes to show that sub-2&#8201;nm confined ion diffusion can be strongly modulated by the surface potential-induced EDL. Depending on the potential sign, the combination and concentration of ion pairs, diffusion rates can be reversibly modulated and anomalously enhanced by 4~7 times within 0.5 volts, across a salt concentration gradient up to seawater salinity. Modelling suggests that this anomalously enhanced diffusion is related to the strong ion&#8211;ion correlations under severe nanoconfinement, and cannot be explained by conventional theoretical predictions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia', 'authors': ['Chi Cheng', '\xa0&\xa0Dan Li']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering and New Horizons Research Centre, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia', 'authors': ['Chi Cheng', ',\xa0George Philip Simon', '\xa0&\xa0Dan Li']}, {'address': 'College of Science, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China', 'authors': ['Gengping Jiang']}, {'address': 'The State Key Laboratory of Refractories and Metallurgy, Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Systems Science on Metallurgical Processing, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China', 'authors': ['Gengping Jiang']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia', 'authors': ['Jefferson Zhe Liu']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia', 'authors': ['Jefferson Zhe Liu']}]",False,"['Chi Cheng', 'Gengping Jiang', 'George Philip Simon', 'Jefferson Zhe Liu', 'Dan Li']","Cheng, C., Jiang, G., Simon, G.P. et al.

letter,Parallel mapping of optical near-field interactions by molecular motor-driven quantum dots,"<p>In the vicinity of metallic nanostructures, absorption and emission rates of optical emitters can be modulated by several orders of magnitude. Control of such near-field light&#8211;matter interaction is essential for applications in biosensing, light harvesting and quantum communication and requires precise mapping of optical near-field interactions, for which single-emitter probes are promising candidates. However, currently available techniques are limited in terms of throughput, resolution and/or non-invasiveness. Here, we present an approach for the parallel mapping of optical near-field interactions with a resolution of&#8201;&lt;5&#8201;nm using surface-bound motor proteins to transport microtubules carrying single emitters (quantum dots). The deterministic motion of the quantum dots allows for the interpolation of their tracked positions, resulting in an increased spatial resolution and a suppression of localization artefacts. We apply this method to map the near-field distribution of nanoslits engraved into gold layers and find an excellent agreement with finite-difference time-domain simulations. Our technique can be readily applied to a variety of surfaces for scalable, nanometre-resolved and artefact-free near-field mapping using conventional wide-field microscopes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nano-Optics and Biophotonics Group, Experimentelle Physik 5, Physikalisches Institut, Wilhelm-Conrad-Röntgen-Center for Complex Material Systems, Universität Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Heiko Groß', '\xa0&\xa0Bert Hecht']}, {'address': 'B CUBE – Center for Molecular Bioengineering, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany', 'authors': ['Hannah S.

letter,High-speed photothermal off-resonance atomic force microscopy reveals assembly routes of centriolar scaffold protein SAS-6,"<p>The self-assembly of protein complexes is at the core of many fundamental biological processes, ranging from the polymerization of cytoskeletal elements, such as microtubules, to viral capsid formation and organelle assembly. To reach a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of self-assembly, high spatial and temporal resolutions must be attained. This is complicated by the need to not interfere with the reaction during the measurement. As self-assemblies are often governed by weak interactions, they are especially difficult to monitor with high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) due to the non-negligible tip&#8211;sample interaction forces involved in current methods. We have developed a HS-AFM technique, photothermal off-resonance tapping (PORT), which is gentle enough to monitor self-assembly reactions driven by weak interactions. We apply PORT to dissect the self-assembly reaction of SAS-6 proteins, which form a nine-fold radially symmetric ring-containing structure that seeds the formation of the centriole organelle. Our analysis reveals the kinetics of SAS-6 ring formation and demonstrates that distinct biogenesis routes can be followed to assemble a nine-fold symmetrical structure.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory for Bio- and Nano-Instrumentation, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Adrian P.

letter,A heterogeneous single-atom palladium catalyst surpassing homogeneous systems for Suzuki coupling,"<p>Palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, central tools in fine-chemical synthesis, predominantly employ soluble metal complexes despite recognized challenges with product purification and catalyst reusability. Attempts to tether these homogeneous catalysts on insoluble carriers have been thwarted by suboptimal stability, which leads to a progressively worsening performance due to metal leaching or clustering. The alternative application of supported Pd nanoparticles has faced limitations because of insufficient activity under the mild conditions required to avoid thermal degradation of the substrates or products. Single-atom heterogeneous catalysts lie at the frontier. Here, we show that the Pd atoms anchored on exfoliated graphitic carbon nitride (Pd-ECN) capture the advantages of both worlds, as they comprise a solid catalyst that matches the high chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance of state-of-the-art homogeneous catalysts for Suzuki couplings, and also demonstrate a robust stability in flow. The adaptive coordination environment within the macroheterocycles of ECN facilitates each catalytic step. The findings illustrate the exciting opportunities presented by nanostructuring single atoms in solid hosts for catalytic processes that remain difficult to heterogenize.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Zupeng Chen', ',\xa0Evgeniya Vorobyeva', ',\xa0Sharon Mitchell', '\xa0&\xa0Javier Pérez-Ramírez']}, {'address': 'Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Tarragona, Spain', 'authors': ['Edvin Fako', ',\xa0Manuel A.

article,"A framework for sustainable nanomaterial selection and design based on performance, hazard, and economic considerations","<p>Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) and ENM-enabled products have emerged as potentially high-performance replacements to conventional materials and chemicals. As such, there is an urgent need to incorporate environmental and human health objectives into ENM selection and design processes. Here, an adapted framework based on the Ashby material selection strategy is presented as an enhanced selection and design process, which includes functional performance as well as environmental and human health considerations. The utility of this framework is demonstrated through two case studies, the design and selection of antimicrobial substances and conductive polymers, including ENMs, ENM-enabled products and their alternatives. Further, these case studies consider both the comparative efficacy and impacts at two scales: (i) a broad scale, where chemical/material classes are readily compared for primary decision-making, and (ii) within a chemical/material class, where physicochemical properties are manipulated to tailor the desired performance and environmental impact profile. Development and implementation of this framework can inform decision-making for the implementation of ENMs to facilitate promising applications and prevent unintended consequences.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Environmental Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA', 'authors': ['Mark M.

article,Non-flammable electrolyte enables Li-metal batteries with aggressive cathode chemistries,"<p>Rechargeable Li-metal batteries using high-voltage cathodes can deliver the highest possible energy densities among all electrochemistries. However, the notorious reactivity of metallic lithium as well as the catalytic nature of high-voltage cathode materials largely prevents their practical application. Here, we report a non-flammable fluorinated electrolyte that supports the most aggressive and high-voltage cathodes in a Li-metal battery. Our battery shows high cycling stability, as evidenced by the efficiencies for Li-metal plating/stripping (99.2%) for a 5&#8201;V cathode LiCoPO<sub>4</sub> (~99.81%) and a Ni-rich LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathode (~99.93%). At a loading of 2.0&#8201;mAh&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, our full cells retain ~93% of their original capacities after 1,000 cycles.

article,Exploring the speed limit of toehold exchange with a cartwheeling DNA acrobat,"<p>Dynamic DNA nanotechnology has yielded nontrivial autonomous behaviours such as stimulus-guided locomotion, computation and programmable molecular assembly. Despite these successes, DNA-based nanomachines suffer from slow kinetics, requiring several minutes or longer to carry out a handful of operations. Here, we pursue the speed limit of an important class of reactions in DNA nanotechnology&#8212;toehold exchange&#8212;through the single-molecule optimization of a novel class of DNA walker that undergoes cartwheeling movements over a field of complementary oligonucleotides. After optimizing this DNA &#8216;acrobat&#8217; for rapid movement, we measure a stepping rate constant approaching 1&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is 10- to 100-fold faster than prior DNA walkers. Finally, we use single-particle tracking to demonstrate movement of the walker over hundreds of nanometres within 10&#8201;min, in quantitative agreement with predictions from stepping kinetics. These results suggest that substantial improvements in the operating rates of broad classes of DNA nanomachines utilizing strand displacement are possible.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Single Molecule Analysis Group, Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA', 'authors': ['Jieming Li', ',\xa0Alexander Johnson-Buck', '\xa0&\xa0Nils G.

article,Pathway-controlled formation of mesostructured all-DNA colloids and superstructures,"<p>DNA has traditionally been used for the programmable design of nanostructures by exploiting its sequence-defined supramolecular recognition. However, control on larger length scales or even hierarchical materials that translate to the macroscale remain difficult to construct. Here, we show that the polymer character of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) can be activated via a nucleobase-specific lower critical solution temperature, which provides a unique access to mesoscale structuring mechanisms on larger length scales. We integrate both effects into ssDNA multiblock copolymers that code sequences for phase separation, hybridization and functionalization. Kinetic pathway guidance using temperature ramps balances the counteracting mesoscale phase separation during heating with nanoscale duplex recognition during cooling to yield a diversity of complex all-DNA colloids with control over the internal dynamics and of their superstructures. Our approach provides a facile and versatile platform to add mesostructural layers into hierarchical all-DNA materials.

article,DNA scaffolds support stable and uniform peptide nanopores,"<p>The assembly of peptides into membrane-spanning nanopores might be promoted by scaffolds to pre-organize the structures. Such scaffolds could enable the construction of uniform pores of various sizes and pores with controlled permutations around a central axis. Here, we show that DNA nanostructures can serve as scaffolds to arrange peptides derived from the octameric polysaccharide transporter Wza to form uniform nanopores in planar lipid bilayers. Our ring-shaped DNA scaffold is assembled from short synthetic oligonucleotides that are connected to Wza peptides through flexible linkers. When scaffolded, the Wza peptides form conducting nanopores of which only octamers are stable and of uniform conductance. Removal of the DNA scaffold by cleavage of the linkers leads to a rapid loss of the nanopores from the lipid bilayer, which shows that the scaffold is essential for their stability. The DNA scaffold also adds functionality to the nanopores by enabling reversible and permanent binding of complementary tagged oligonucleotides near the nanopore entrance.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Chemistry Research Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', 'authors': ['Evan Spruijt', '\xa0&\xa0Hagan Bayley']}, {'address': 'Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK', 'authors': ['Samuel E.

article,Combination of fucoidan-based magnetic nanoparticles and immunomodulators enhances tumour-localized immunotherapy,"<p>Checkpoint immunotherapy that inhibits tumour immune evasion has demonstrated significant clinical success. However, the therapeutic response is limited to certain patient populations, and immunotoxicity as well as autoimmunity have compromised the therapeutic benefits. Here, we report on an inherently therapeutic fucoidan&#8211;dextran-based magnetic nanomedicine (IO@FuDex<sup>3</sup>) conjugated with a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1) and T-cell activators (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28). IO@FuDex<sup>3</sup> can repair the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment by reinvigorating tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, while targeting the nanomedicine via magnetic navigation to the tumour to minimize off-target effects. Treatment that combines IO@FuDex<sup>3</sup> and magnetic navigation reduces the occurrence of adverse events and extends the median survival from 32 to 63 days with less than 1&#8201;per cent dose compared with soluble anti-PD-L1. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of integrating anti-PD-L1 and T-cell activators as a form of inherently therapeutic nanomedicine to augment the therapeutic index of combination checkpoint immunotherapy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['Chih-Sheng Chiang', ',\xa0Yen-Ho Lai', ',\xa0Hung-Wei Cheng', '\xa0&\xa0San-Yuan Chen']}, {'address': 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['Yu-Jung Lin', ',\xa0Chia-Hung Hsieh', '\xa0&\xa0Woei-Cherng Shyu']}, {'address': 'Undergraduate Honours Program of Nano Science and Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['Rachel Lee']}, {'address': 'Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['Chia-Hung Hsieh']}, {'address': 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['Chia-Hung Hsieh']}, {'address': 'Translational Medicine Research Centre, and Department of Neurology, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['Woei-Cherng Shyu']}, {'address': 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Science, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['Woei-Cherng Shyu']}, {'address': 'Department of Occupational Therapy, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['Woei-Cherng Shyu']}, {'address': 'Frontier Research Centre on Fundamental and Applied Sciences of Matters, NTHU, Taiwan, Republic of China', 'authors': ['San-Yuan Chen']}]",False,"['Chih-Sheng Chiang', 'Yu-Jung Lin', 'Rachel Lee', 'Yen-Ho Lai', 'Hung-Wei Cheng', 'Chia-Hung Hsieh', 'Woei-Cherng Shyu', 'San-Yuan Chen']","Chiang, C., Lin, Y., Lee, R. et al.

Graphene&#8217;s peculiar properties can cause various cellular changes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that single-layer graphene increases neuronal firing by altering membrane-associated functions in cultured cells. Graphene tunes the distribution of extracellular ions at the interface with neurons, a key regulator of neuronal excitability. The resulting biophysical changes in the membrane include stronger potassium ion currents, with a shift in the fraction of neuronal firing phenotypes from adapting to tonically firing.
