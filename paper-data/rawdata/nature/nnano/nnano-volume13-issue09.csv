review article,Paving the way to single-molecule protein sequencing,"<p>Proteins are major building blocks of life. The protein content of a cell and an organism provides key information for the understanding of biological processes and disease. Despite the importance of protein analysis, only a handful of techniques are available to determine protein sequences, and these methods face limitations, for example, requiring a sizable amount of sample. Single-molecule techniques would revolutionize proteomics research, providing ultimate sensitivity for the detection of low-abundance proteins and the realization of single-cell proteomics. In recent years, novel single-molecule protein sequencing schemes that use fluorescence, tunnelling currents and nanopores have been proposed. Here, we present a review of these approaches, together with the first experimental efforts towards their realization. We discuss their advantages and drawbacks, and present our perspective on the development of single-molecule protein sequencing techniques.</p>",[],False,"[""Laura Restrepo-P\u00e9rez"", ""Chirlmin Joo"", ""Cees Dekker""]","Restrepo-Pérez, L., Joo, C. & Dekker, C.

letter,Fast thermal relaxation in cavity-coupled graphene bolometers with a Johnson noise read-out,"<p>High sensitivity, fast response time and strong light absorption are the most important metrics for infrared sensing and imaging. The trade-off between these characteristics remains the primary challenge in bolometry. Graphene with its unique combination of a record small electronic heat capacity and a weak electron&#8211;phonon coupling has emerged as a sensitive bolometric medium that allows for high intrinsic bandwidths<sup>&#8211;</sup>. Moreover, the material&#8217;s light absorption can be enhanced to near unity by integration into photonic structures. Here, we introduce an integrated hot-electron bolometer based on Johnson noise readout of electrons in ultra-clean hexagonal-boron-nitride-encapsulated graphene, which is critically coupled to incident radiation through a photonic nanocavity with Q&#8201;=&#8201;900. The device operates at telecom wavelengths and shows an enhanced bolometric response at charge neutrality. At 5&#8201;K, we obtain a noise equivalent power of about 10&#8201;pW&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8211;</sup><sup>1/2</sup>, a record fast thermal relaxation time, &lt;35&#8201;ps, and an improved light absorption. However the device can operate even above 300&#8201;K with reduced sensitivity. We work out the performance mechanisms and limits of the graphene bolometer and give important insights towards the potential development of practical applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Dmitri K.

letter,Metallic supercurrent field-effect transistor,"<p>In their original formulation of superconductivity, the London brothers predicted the exponential suppression of an electrostatic field inside a superconductor over the so-called London penetration depth, &#955;<sub>L</sub>. Despite a few experiments indicating hints of perturbation induced by electrostatic fields, no clue has been provided so far on the possibility to manipulate metallic superconductors via the field effect. Here, we report field-effect control of the supercurrent in all-metallic transistors made of different Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superconducting thin films. At low temperature, our field-effect transistors show a monotonic decay of the critical current under increasing electrostatic field up to total quenching for gate voltage values as large as &#177;40&#8201;V in titanium-based devices. This bipolar field effect persists up to ~85% of the critical temperature (~0.41&#8201;K), and in the presence of sizable magnetic fields. A similar behaviour is observed in aluminium thin-film field-effect transistors. A phenomenological theory accounts for our observations, and points towards the interpretation in terms of an electric-field-induced perturbation propagating inside the superconducting film. In our understanding, this affects the pairing potential and quenches the supercurrent. These results could represent a groundbreaking asset for the realization of all-metallic superconducting field-effect electronics and leading-edge quantum information architectures.</p>",[],False,"[""Giorgio De Simoni"", ""Federico Paolucci"", ""Paolo Solinas"", ""Elia Strambini"", ""Francesco Giazotto""]","De Simoni, G., Paolucci, F., Solinas, P. et al.

letter,Nanogap near-field thermophotovoltaics,"<p>Conversion of heat to electricity via solid-state devices is of great interest and has led to intense research of thermoelectric materials. Alternative approaches for solid-state heat-to-electricity conversion include thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems where photons from a hot emitter traverse a vacuum gap and are absorbed by a photovoltaic (PV) cell to generate electrical power. In principle, such systems may also achieve higher efficiencies and offer more versatility in use. However, the typical temperature of the hot emitter remains too low (&lt;1,000&#8201;K) to achieve a sufficient photon flux to the PV cell, limiting practical applications. Theoretical proposals suggest that near-field (NF) effects that arise in nanoscale gaps may be leveraged to increase the photon flux to the PV cell and significantly enhance the power output. Here, we describe functional NFTPV devices consisting of a microfabricated system and a custom-built nanopositioner and demonstrate an ~40-fold enhancement in the power output at nominally 60&#8201;nm gaps relative to the far field. We systematically characterize this enhancement over a range of gap sizes and emitter temperatures, and for PV cells with two different bandgap energies. We anticipate that this technology, once optimized, will be viable for waste heat recovery applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Anthony Fiorino"", ""Linxiao Zhu"", ""Dakotah Thompson"", ""Rohith Mittapally"", ""Pramod Reddy"", ""Edgar Meyhofer""]","Fiorino, A., Zhu, L., Thompson, D. et al.

At an experimental level, it is highly challenging to create the specific strain texture that can generate PMFs over large areas. Here, we report that superposing graphene on multilayer black phosphorus creates shear-strained superlattices that generate a PMF over an entire graphene&#8211;black phosphorus heterostructure with edge size of tens of micrometres. The PMF is intertwined with the spatial period of the moir&#233; pattern, and its spatial distribution and intensity can be modified by changing the relative orientation of the two materials. We show that the emerging pseudo-Landau levels influence the transport properties of graphene&#8211;black phosphorus field-effect transistor devices with Hall bar geometry.

article,High Purcell factor generation of indistinguishable on-chip single photons,"<p>On-chip single-photon sources are key components for integrated photonic quantum technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots can exhibit near-ideal single-photon emission, but this can be significantly degraded in on-chip geometries owing to nearby etched surfaces. A long-proposed solution to improve the indistinguishablility is to use the Purcell effect to reduce the radiative lifetime. However, until now only modest Purcell enhancements have been observed. Here we use pulsed resonant excitation to eliminate slow relaxation paths, revealing a highly Purcell-shortened radiative lifetime (22.7&#8201;ps) in a waveguide-coupled quantum dot&#8211;photonic crystal cavity system. This leads to near-lifetime-limited single-photon emission that retains high indistinguishablility (93.9%) on a timescale in which 20 photons may be emitted.

article,Dissipative adaptation in driven self-assembly leading to self-dividing fibrils,"<p>Out-of-equilibrium self-assembly of proteins such as actin and tubulin is a key regulatory process controlling cell shape, motion and division. The design of functional nanosystems based on dissipative self-assembly has proven to be remarkably difficult due to a complete lack of control over the spatial and temporal characteristics of the assembly process. Here, we show the dissipative self-assembly of FtsZ protein (a bacterial homologue of tubulin) within coacervate droplets. More specifically, we show how such barrier-free compartments govern the local availability of the energy-rich building block guanosine triphosphate, yielding highly dynamic fibrils. The increased flux of FtsZ monomers at the tips of the fibrils results in localized FtsZ assembly, elongation of the coacervate compartments, followed by division of the fibrils into two. We rationalize the directional growth and division of the fibrils using dissipative reaction&#8211;diffusion kinetics and capillary action of the filaments as main inputs. The principle presented here, in which open compartments are used to modulate the rates of dissipative self-assembly by restricting the absorption of energy from the environment, may provide a general route to dissipatively adapting nanosystems exhibiting life-like behaviour.</p>",[],False,"[""Esra te Brinke"", ""Joost Groen"", ""Andreas Herrmann"", ""Hans A.

article,Direct observation of noble metal nanoparticles transforming to thermally stable single atoms,"<p>Single noble metal atoms and ultrafine metal clusters catalysts tend to sinter into aggregated particles at elevated temperatures, driven by the decrease of metal surface free energy. Herein, we report an unexpected phenomenon that noble metal nanoparticles (Pd, Pt, Au-NPs) can be transformed to thermally stable single atoms (Pd, Pt, Au-SAs) above 900&#8201;&#176;C in an inert atmosphere. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms was confirmed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structures. The dynamic process was recorded by in&#8201;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy, which showed competing sintering and atomization processes during NP-to-SA conversion. Further, density functional theory calculations revealed that high-temperature NP-to-SA conversion was driven by the formation of the more thermodynamically stable Pd-N<sub>4</sub> structure when mobile Pd atoms were captured on the defects of nitrogen-doped carbon. The thermally stable single atoms (Pd-SAs) exhibited even better activity and selectivity than nanoparticles (Pd-NPs) for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene.</p>",[],False,"[""Shengjie Wei"", ""Ang Li"", ""Jin-Cheng Liu"", ""Zhi Li"", ""Wenxing Chen"", ""Yue Gong"", ""Qinghua Zhang"", ""Weng-Chon Cheong"", ""Yu Wang"", ""Lirong Zheng"", ""Hai Xiao"", ""Chen Chen"", ""Dingsheng Wang"", ""Qing Peng"", ""Lin Gu"", ""Xiaodong Han"", ""Jun Li"", ""Yadong Li""]","Wei, S., Li, A., Liu, JC. et al.

article,Pre-adsorption of antibodies enables targeting of nanocarriers despite a biomolecular corona,"<p>To promote drug delivery to exact sites and cell types, the surface of nanocarriers is functionalized with targeting antibodies or ligands, typically coupled by covalent chemistry. Once the nanocarrier is exposed to biological fluid such as plasma, however, its surface is inevitably covered with various biomolecules forming the protein corona, which masks the targeting ability of the nanoparticle. Here, we show that we can use a pre-adsorption process to attach targeting antibodies to the surface of the nanocarrier. Pre-adsorbed antibodies remain functional and are not completely exchanged or covered by the biomolecular corona, whereas coupled antibodies are more affected by this shielding. We conclude that pre-adsorption is potentially a versatile, efficient and rapid method of attaching targeting moieties to the surface of nanocarriers.</p>",[],False,"[""Manuel Tonigold"", ""Johanna Simon"", ""Diego Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n"", ""Maria Kokkinopoulou"", ""Jonas Reinholz"", ""Ulrike Kintzel"", ""Anke Kaltbeitzel"", ""Patricia Renz"", ""Matthias P.
