review article,Interfacing nature's catalytic machinery with synthetic materials for semi-artificial photosynthesis,"<p>Semi-artificial photosynthetic systems aim to overcome the limitations of natural and artificial photosynthesis while providing an opportunity to investigate their respective functionality. The progress and studies of these hybrid systems is the focus of this forward-looking perspective. In this Review, we discuss how enzymes have been interfaced with synthetic materials and employed for semi-artificial fuel production. In parallel, we examine how more complex living cellular systems can be recruited for in vivo fuel and chemical production in an approach where inorganic nanostructures are hybridized with photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic microorganisms. Side-by-side comparisons reveal strengths and limitations of enzyme- and microorganism-based hybrid systems, and how lessons extracted from studying enzyme hybrids can be applied to investigations of microorganism-hybrid devices. We conclude by putting semi-artificial photosynthesis in the context of its own ambitions and discuss how it can help address the grand challenges facing artificial systems for the efficient generation of solar fuels and chemicals.</p>",[],False,"[""Nikolay Kornienko"", ""Jenny Z.

letter,Bacteria photosensitized by intracellular gold nanoclusters for solar fuel production,"<p>The demand for renewable and sustainable fuel has prompted the rapid development of advanced nanotechnologies to effectively harness solar power. The construction of photosynthetic biohybrid systems (PBSs) aims to link preassembled biosynthetic pathways with inorganic light absorbers. This strategy inherits both the high light-harvesting efficiency of solid-state semiconductors and the superior catalytic performance of whole-cell microorganisms. Here, we introduce an intracellular, biocompatible light absorber, in the form of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer for existing PBSs. Translocation of these AuNCs into non-photosynthetic bacteria enables photosynthesis of acetic acid from CO<sub>2</sub>. The AuNCs also serve as inhibitors of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to maintain high bacterium viability. With the dual advantages of light absorption and biocompatibility, this new generation of PBS can efficiently harvest sunlight and transfer photogenerated electrons to cellular metabolism, realizing CO<sub>2</sub> fixation continuously over several days.</p>",[],False,"[""Hao Zhang"", ""Hao Liu"", ""Zhiquan Tian"", ""Dylan Lu"", ""Yi Yu"", ""Stefano Cestellos-Blanco"", ""Kelsey K.

letter,Interacting polariton fluids in a monolayer of tungsten disulfide,"<p>Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess a number of properties that make them attractive for realizing room-temperature polariton devices. An ideal platform for manipulating polariton fluids within monolayer TMDs is that of Bloch surface waves, which confine the electric field to a small volume near the surface of a dielectric mirror. Here we demonstrate that monolayer tungsten disulfide can sustain Bloch surface wave polaritons (BSWPs) with a Rabi splitting of 43&#8201;meV and propagation lengths reaching 33&#8201;&#956;m. In addition, we show strong polariton&#8211;polariton nonlinearities within BSWPs, which manifest themselves as a reversible blueshift of the lower polariton resonance. Such nonlinearities are at the heart of polariton devices and have not yet been demonstrated in TMD polaritons. As a proof of concept, we use the nonlinearity to implement a nonlinear polariton source. Our results demonstrate that BSWPs using TMDs can support long-range propagation combined with strong nonlinearities, enabling potential applications in integrated optical processing and polaritonic circuits.</p>",[],False,"[""F\u00e1bio Barachati"", ""Antonio Fieramosca"", ""Soroush Hafezian"", ""Jie Gu"", ""Biswanath Chakraborty"", ""Dario Ballarini"", ""Ludvik Martinu"", ""Vinod Menon"", ""Daniele Sanvitto"", ""St\u00e9phane K\u00e9na-Cohen""]","Barachati, F., Fieramosca, A., Hafezian, S. et al.

letter,"Generation, transport and detection of valley-locked spin photocurrent in WSe2–graphene–Bi2Se3 heterostructures","<p>Quantum optoelectronic devices capable of isolating a target degree of freedom (DoF) from other DoFs have allowed for new applications in modern information technology. Many works on solid-state spintronics have focused on methods to disentangle the spin DoF from the charge DoF, yet many related issues remain unresolved. Although the recent advent of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has enabled the use of valley pseudospin as an alternative DoF, it is nontrivial to separate the spin DoF from the valley DoF since the time-reversal valley DoF is intrinsically locked with the spin DoF. Here, we demonstrate lateral TMD&#8211;graphene&#8211;topological insulator hetero-devices with the possibility of such a DoF-selective measurement. We generate the valley-locked spin DoF via a circular photogalvanic effect in an electric-double-layer WSe<sub>2</sub> transistor. The valley-locked spin photocarriers then diffuse in a submicrometre-long graphene layer, and the spin DoF is measured separately in the topological insulator via non-local electrical detection using the characteristic spin&#8211;momentum locking. Operating at room temperature, our integrated devices exhibit a non-local spin polarization degree of higher than 0.5, providing the potential for coupled opto-spin&#8211;valleytronic applications that independently exploit the valley and spin DoFs.</p>",[],False,"[""Soonyoung Cha"", ""Minji Noh"", ""Jehyun Kim"", ""Jangyup Son"", ""Hyemin Bae"", ""Doeon Lee"", ""Hoil Kim"", ""Jekwan Lee"", ""Ho-Seung Shin"", ""Sangwan Sim"", ""Seunghoon Yang"", ""Sooun Lee"", ""Wooyoung Shim"", ""Chul-Ho Lee"", ""Moon-Ho Jo"", ""Jun Sung Kim"", ""Dohun Kim"", ""Hyunyong Choi""]","Cha, S., Noh, M., Kim, J. et al.

letter,Superconducting gatemon qubit based on a proximitized two-dimensional electron gas,"<p>The coherent tunnelling of Cooper pairs across Josephson junctions (JJs) generates a nonlinear inductance that is used extensively in quantum information processors based on superconducting circuits, from setting qubit transition frequencies and interqubit coupling strengths to the gain of parametric amplifiers for quantum-limited readout. The inductance is either set by tailoring the metal oxide dimensions of single JJs, or magnetically tuned by parallelizing multiple JJs in superconducting quantum interference devices with local current-biased flux lines. JJs based on superconductor&#8211;semiconductor hybrids represent a tantalizing all-electric alternative. The gatemon is a recently developed transmon variant that employs locally gated nanowire superconductor&#8211;semiconductor JJs for qubit control. Here we go beyond proof-of-concept and demonstrate that semiconducting channels etched from a wafer-scale two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) are a suitable platform for building a scalable gatemon-based quantum computer. We show that 2DEG gatemons meet the requirements by performing voltage-controlled single qubit rotations and two-qubit swap operations.

letter,A quantum-dot heat engine operating close to the thermodynamic efficiency limits,"<p>Cyclical heat engines are a paradigm of classical thermodynamics, but are impractical for miniaturization because they rely on moving parts. A more recent concept is particle-exchange (PE) heat engines, which uses energy filtering to control a thermally driven particle flow between two heat reservoirs. As they do not require moving parts and can be realized in solid-state materials, they are suitable for low-power applications and miniaturization. It was predicted that PE engines could reach the same thermodynamically ideal efficiency limits as those accessible to cyclical engines, but this prediction has not been verified experimentally. Here, we demonstrate a PE heat engine based on a quantum dot (QD) embedded into a semiconductor nanowire. We directly measure the engine&#8217;s steady-state electric power output and combine it with the calculated electronic heat flow to determine the electronic efficiency &#951;. We find that at the maximum power conditions, &#951; is in agreement with the Curzon&#8211;Ahlborn efficiency and that the overall maximum &#951; is in excess of 70% of the Carnot efficiency while maintaining a finite power output.

Here, we introduce an ensemble mFRET (emFRET) model, and apply it to guide barcoding into regimes with extreme FRET. We further introduce a facile, proportional multicolour labelling method using oligonucleotides as homogeneous linkers. A total of 580 barcodes were rapidly designed and validated using four dyes&#8212;with FRET efficiencies reaching 76%&#8212;and used for multiplexed immunoassays with cytometric readout and fully automated decoding.

letter,Construction of integrated gene logic-chip,"<p>In synthetic biology, the control of gene expression requires a multistep processing of biological signals. The key steps are sensing the environment, computing information and outputting products. To achieve such functions, the laborious, combinational networking of enzymes and substrate-genes is required, and to resolve problems, sophisticated design automation tools have been introduced. However, the complexity of genetic circuits remains low because it is difficult to completely avoid crosstalk between the circuits. Here, we have made an orthogonal self-contained device by integrating an actuator and sensors onto a DNA origami-based nanochip that contains an enzyme, T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) and multiple target-gene substrates. This gene nanochip orthogonally transcribes its own genes, and the nano-layout ability of DNA origami allows us to rationally design gene expression levels by controlling the intermolecular distances between the enzyme and the target genes. We further integrated reprogrammable logic gates so that the nanochip responds to water-in-oil droplets and computes their small RNA (miRNA) profiles, which demonstrates that the nanochip can function as a gene logic-chip.

letter,Lifetime-engineered NIR-II nanoparticles unlock multiplexed in vivo imaging,"<p>Deep tissue imaging in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window holds great promise for physiological studies and biomedical applications. However, inhomogeneous signal attenuation in biological matter hampers the application of multiple-wavelength NIR-II probes to multiplexed imaging. Here, we present lanthanide-doped NIR-II nanoparticles with engineered luminescence lifetimes for in vivo quantitative imaging using time-domain multiplexing. To achieve this, we have devised a systematic approach based on controlled energy relay that creates a tunable lifetime range spanning three orders of magnitude with a single emission band. We consistently resolve selected lifetimes from the NIR-II nanoparticle probes at depths of up to 8&#8201;mm in biological tissues, where the signal-to-noise ratio derived from intensity measurements drops below 1.5. We demonstrate that robust lifetime coding is independent of tissue penetration depth, and we apply in vivo multiplexing to identify tumour subtypes in living mice.

Electrostatic and geometric boundary conditions induce two stable domain configurations: centre-convergent and centre-divergent.

article,Enhanced water splitting under modal strong coupling conditions,"<p>Strong coupling between plasmons and optical modes, such as waveguide or resonator modes, gives rise to a splitting in the plasmon absorption band. As a result, two new hybrid modes are formed that exhibit near-field enhancement effects. These hybrid modes have been exploited to improve light absorption in a number of systems. Here we show that this modal strong coupling between a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot nanocavity mode and a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) facilitates water splitting reactions. We use a gold nanoparticle (Au-NP)/TiO<sub>2</sub>/Au-film structure as a photoanode. This structure exhibits modal strong coupling between the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot nanocavity modes of the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film/Au film and LSPR of the Au NPs. Electronic excitation of the Au NPs is promoted by the optical hybrid modes across a broad range of wavelengths, followed by a hot electron transfer to TiO<sub>2</sub>. A key feature of our structure is that the Au NPs are partially inlaid in the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, which results in an enhancement of the coupling strength and water-oxidation efficiency. We observe an 11-fold increase in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency with respect to a photoanode structure with no Au film. Also, the internal quantum efficiency is enhanced 1.5 times under a strong coupling over that under uncoupled conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Xu Shi"", ""Kosei Ueno"", ""Tomoya Oshikiri"", ""Quan Sun"", ""Keiji Sasaki"", ""Hiroaki Misawa""]","Shi, X., Ueno, K., Oshikiri, T. et al.

article,Tunable thermal transport and reversible thermal conductivity switching in topologically networked bio-inspired materials,"<p>The dynamic control of thermal transport properties in solids must contend with the fact that phonons are inherently broadband. Thus, efforts to create reversible thermal conductivity switches have resulted in only modest on/off ratios, since only a relatively narrow portion of the phononic spectrum is impacted. Here, we report on the ability to modulate the thermal conductivity of topologically networked materials by nearly a factor of four following hydration, through manipulation of the displacement amplitude of atomic vibrations. By varying the network topology, or crosslinked structure, of squid ring teeth-based bio-polymers through tandem-repetition of DNA sequences, we show that this thermal switching ratio can be directly programmed. This on/off ratio in thermal conductivity switching is over a factor of three larger than the current state-of-the-art thermal switch, offering the possibility of engineering thermally conductive biological materials with dynamic responsivity to heat.</p>",[],False,"[""John A.

article,Plasmonic meta-electrodes allow intracellular recordings at network level on high-density CMOS-multi-electrode arrays,"<p>The ability to monitor electrogenic cells accurately plays a pivotal role in neuroscience, cardiology and cell biology. Despite pioneering research and long-lasting efforts, the existing methods for intracellular recording of action potentials on the large network scale suffer limitations that prevent their widespread use. Here, we introduce the concept of a meta-electrode, a planar porous electrode that mimics the optical and biological behaviour of three-dimensional plasmonic antennas but also preserves the ability to work as an electrode. Its synergistic combination with plasmonic optoacoustic poration allows commercial complementary metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor multi-electrode arrays to record intracellular action potentials in large cellular networks. We apply this approach to measure signals from human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cells, rodent primary cardiomyocytes and immortalized cell types and demonstrate the possibility of non-invasively testing a variety of relevant drugs. Due to its robustness and easiness of use, we expect the method will be rapidly adopted by the scientific community and by pharmaceutical companies.</p>",[],False,"[""Michele Dipalo"", ""Giovanni Melle"", ""Laura Lovato"", ""Andrea Jacassi"", ""Francesca Santoro"", ""Valeria Caprettini"", ""Andrea Schirato"", ""Alessandro Alabastri"", ""Denis Garoli"", ""Giulia Bruno"", ""Francesco Tantussi"", ""Francesco De Angelis""]","Dipalo, M., Melle, G., Lovato, L. et al.
