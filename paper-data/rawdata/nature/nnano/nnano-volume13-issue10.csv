review article,Interfacing nature's catalytic machinery with synthetic materials for semi-artificial photosynthesis,"<p>Semi-artificial photosynthetic systems aim to overcome the limitations of natural and artificial photosynthesis while providing an opportunity to investigate their respective functionality. The progress and studies of these hybrid systems is the focus of this forward-looking perspective. In this Review, we discuss how enzymes have been interfaced with synthetic materials and employed for semi-artificial fuel production. In parallel, we examine how more complex living cellular systems can be recruited for in vivo fuel and chemical production in an approach where inorganic nanostructures are hybridized with photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic microorganisms. Side-by-side comparisons reveal strengths and limitations of enzyme- and microorganism-based hybrid systems, and how lessons extracted from studying enzyme hybrids can be applied to investigations of microorganism-hybrid devices. We conclude by putting semi-artificial photosynthesis in the context of its own ambitions and discuss how it can help address the grand challenges facing artificial systems for the efficient generation of solar fuels and chemicals.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK', 'authors': ['Nikolay Kornienko', ',\xa0Jenny Z.

letter,Bacteria photosensitized by intracellular gold nanoclusters for solar fuel production,"<p>The demand for renewable and sustainable fuel has prompted the rapid development of advanced nanotechnologies to effectively harness solar power. The construction of photosynthetic biohybrid systems (PBSs) aims to link preassembled biosynthetic pathways with inorganic light absorbers. This strategy inherits both the high light-harvesting efficiency of solid-state semiconductors and the superior catalytic performance of whole-cell microorganisms. Here, we introduce an intracellular, biocompatible light absorber, in the form of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer for existing PBSs. Translocation of these AuNCs into non-photosynthetic bacteria enables photosynthesis of acetic acid from CO<sub>2</sub>. The AuNCs also serve as inhibitors of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to maintain high bacterium viability. With the dual advantages of light absorption and biocompatibility, this new generation of PBS can efficiently harvest sunlight and transfer photogenerated electrons to cellular metabolism, realizing CO<sub>2</sub> fixation continuously over several days.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Hao Zhang', ',\xa0Hao Liu', ',\xa0Zhiquan Tian', ',\xa0Dylan Lu', ',\xa0Yi Yu', ',\xa0Kelsey K.

letter,Interacting polariton fluids in a monolayer of tungsten disulfide,"<p>Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess a number of properties that make them attractive for realizing room-temperature polariton devices. An ideal platform for manipulating polariton fluids within monolayer TMDs is that of Bloch surface waves, which confine the electric field to a small volume near the surface of a dielectric mirror. Here we demonstrate that monolayer tungsten disulfide can sustain Bloch surface wave polaritons (BSWPs) with a Rabi splitting of 43&#8201;meV and propagation lengths reaching 33&#8201;&#956;m. In addition, we show strong polariton&#8211;polariton nonlinearities within BSWPs, which manifest themselves as a reversible blueshift of the lower polariton resonance. Such nonlinearities are at the heart of polariton devices and have not yet been demonstrated in TMD polaritons. As a proof of concept, we use the nonlinearity to implement a nonlinear polariton source. Our results demonstrate that BSWPs using TMDs can support long-range propagation combined with strong nonlinearities, enabling potential applications in integrated optical processing and polaritonic circuits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Engineering Physics, École Polytechnique de Montréal, Montréal, Quebec, Canada', 'authors': ['Fábio Barachati', ',\xa0Soroush Hafezian', ',\xa0Ludvik Martinu', '\xa0&\xa0Stéphane Kéna-Cohen']}, {'address': 'CNR - NANOTEC, Istituto di Nanotecnologia, Lecce, Italy', 'authors': ['Antonio Fieramosca', ',\xa0Dario Ballarini', '\xa0&\xa0Daniele Sanvitto']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, City College & Graduate Center of the City University of New York, New York, NY, USA', 'authors': ['Jie Gu', ',\xa0Biswanath Chakraborty', '\xa0&\xa0Vinod Menon']}, {'address': 'INFN, Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Lecce, Lecce, Italy', 'authors': ['Daniele Sanvitto']}]",False,"['Fábio Barachati', 'Antonio Fieramosca', 'Soroush Hafezian', 'Jie Gu', 'Biswanath Chakraborty', 'Dario Ballarini', 'Ludvik Martinu', 'Vinod Menon', 'Daniele Sanvitto', 'Stéphane Kéna-Cohen']","Barachati, F., Fieramosca, A., Hafezian, S. et al.

letter,"Generation, transport and detection of valley-locked spin photocurrent in WSe2–graphene–Bi2Se3 heterostructures","<p>Quantum optoelectronic devices capable of isolating a target degree of freedom (DoF) from other DoFs have allowed for new applications in modern information technology. Many works on solid-state spintronics have focused on methods to disentangle the spin DoF from the charge DoF, yet many related issues remain unresolved. Although the recent advent of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has enabled the use of valley pseudospin as an alternative DoF, it is nontrivial to separate the spin DoF from the valley DoF since the time-reversal valley DoF is intrinsically locked with the spin DoF. Here, we demonstrate lateral TMD&#8211;graphene&#8211;topological insulator hetero-devices with the possibility of such a DoF-selective measurement. We generate the valley-locked spin DoF via a circular photogalvanic effect in an electric-double-layer WSe<sub>2</sub> transistor. The valley-locked spin photocarriers then diffuse in a submicrometre-long graphene layer, and the spin DoF is measured separately in the topological insulator via non-local electrical detection using the characteristic spin&#8211;momentum locking. Operating at room temperature, our integrated devices exhibit a non-local spin polarization degree of higher than 0.5, providing the potential for coupled opto-spin&#8211;valleytronic applications that independently exploit the valley and spin DoFs.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Soonyoung Cha', ',\xa0Minji Noh', ',\xa0Hyemin Bae', ',\xa0Doeon Lee', ',\xa0Jekwan Lee', ',\xa0Ho-Seung Shin', ',\xa0Sangwan Sim', '\xa0&\xa0Hyunyong Choi']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Jehyun Kim', ',\xa0Jangyup Son', '\xa0&\xa0Dohun Kim']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Jangyup Son']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA', 'authors': ['Doeon Lee']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea', 'authors': ['Hoil Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Jun Sung Kim']}, {'address': 'Centre for Artificial Low Dimensional Electronic Systems, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Pohang, Korea', 'authors': ['Hoil Kim', ',\xa0Sangwan Sim', ',\xa0Moon-Ho Jo', '\xa0&\xa0Jun Sung Kim']}, {'address': 'KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Seunghoon Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Chul-Ho Lee']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea', 'authors': ['Sooun Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Wooyoung Shim']}, {'address': 'Division of Advanced Materials Science and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea', 'authors': ['Moon-Ho Jo']}]",False,"['Soonyoung Cha', 'Minji Noh', 'Jehyun Kim', 'Jangyup Son', 'Hyemin Bae', 'Doeon Lee', 'Hoil Kim', 'Jekwan Lee', 'Ho-Seung Shin', 'Sangwan Sim', 'Seunghoon Yang', 'Sooun Lee', 'Wooyoung Shim', 'Chul-Ho Lee', 'Moon-Ho Jo', 'Jun Sung Kim', 'Dohun Kim', 'Hyunyong Choi']","Cha, S., Noh, M., Kim, J. et al.

letter,Superconducting gatemon qubit based on a proximitized two-dimensional electron gas,"<p>The coherent tunnelling of Cooper pairs across Josephson junctions (JJs) generates a nonlinear inductance that is used extensively in quantum information processors based on superconducting circuits, from setting qubit transition frequencies and interqubit coupling strengths to the gain of parametric amplifiers for quantum-limited readout. The inductance is either set by tailoring the metal oxide dimensions of single JJs, or magnetically tuned by parallelizing multiple JJs in superconducting quantum interference devices with local current-biased flux lines. JJs based on superconductor&#8211;semiconductor hybrids represent a tantalizing all-electric alternative. The gatemon is a recently developed transmon variant that employs locally gated nanowire superconductor&#8211;semiconductor JJs for qubit control. Here we go beyond proof-of-concept and demonstrate that semiconducting channels etched from a wafer-scale two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) are a suitable platform for building a scalable gatemon-based quantum computer. We show that 2DEG gatemons meet the requirements by performing voltage-controlled single qubit rotations and two-qubit swap operations. We measure qubit coherence times up to ~2&#8201;&#956;s, limited by dielectric loss in the 2DEG substrate.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Quantum Devices, Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark', 'authors': ['Lucas Casparis', ',\xa0Malcolm R.

letter,A quantum-dot heat engine operating close to the thermodynamic efficiency limits,"<p>Cyclical heat engines are a paradigm of classical thermodynamics, but are impractical for miniaturization because they rely on moving parts. A more recent concept is particle-exchange (PE) heat engines, which uses energy filtering to control a thermally driven particle flow between two heat reservoirs. As they do not require moving parts and can be realized in solid-state materials, they are suitable for low-power applications and miniaturization. It was predicted that PE engines could reach the same thermodynamically ideal efficiency limits as those accessible to cyclical engines, but this prediction has not been verified experimentally. Here, we demonstrate a PE heat engine based on a quantum dot (QD) embedded into a semiconductor nanowire. We directly measure the engine&#8217;s steady-state electric power output and combine it with the calculated electronic heat flow to determine the electronic efficiency &#951;. We find that at the maximum power conditions, &#951; is in agreement with the Curzon&#8211;Ahlborn efficiency and that the overall maximum &#951; is in excess of 70% of the Carnot efficiency while maintaining a finite power output.

letter,Ensemble multicolour FRET model enables barcoding at extreme FRET levels,"<p>Quantitative models of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8212;pioneered by F&#246;rster&#8212;define our understanding of FRET and underpin its widespread use. However, multicolour FRET (mFRET), which arises between multiple, stochastically distributed fluorophores, lacks a mechanistic model and remains intractable. mFRET notably arises in fluorescently barcoded microparticles, resulting in a complex, non-orthogonal fluorescence response that impedes their encoding and decoding. Here, we introduce an ensemble mFRET (emFRET) model, and apply it to guide barcoding into regimes with extreme FRET.

letter,Construction of integrated gene logic-chip,"<p>In synthetic biology, the control of gene expression requires a multistep processing of biological signals. The key steps are sensing the environment, computing information and outputting products. To achieve such functions, the laborious, combinational networking of enzymes and substrate-genes is required, and to resolve problems, sophisticated design automation tools have been introduced. However, the complexity of genetic circuits remains low because it is difficult to completely avoid crosstalk between the circuits. Here, we have made an orthogonal self-contained device by integrating an actuator and sensors onto a DNA origami-based nanochip that contains an enzyme, T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) and multiple target-gene substrates. This gene nanochip orthogonally transcribes its own genes, and the nano-layout ability of DNA origami allows us to rationally design gene expression levels by controlling the intermolecular distances between the enzyme and the target genes. We further integrated reprogrammable logic gates so that the nanochip responds to water-in-oil droplets and computes their small RNA (miRNA) profiles, which demonstrates that the nanochip can function as a gene logic-chip. Our approach to component integration on a nanochip may provide a basis for large-scale, integrated genetic circuits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Graduate School of Frontier Science, The University of Tokyo, Chiba, Japan', 'authors': ['Takeya Masubuchi', ',\xa0Hao Qi', ',\xa0Ryosuke Iinuma', ',\xa0Yuya Miyazono', ',\xa0Takuya Ueda', '\xa0&\xa0Hisashi Tadakuma']}, {'address': 'Graduate School of Science, Department of Chemistry, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan', 'authors': ['Masayuki Endo', '\xa0&\xa0Hiroshi Sugiyama']}, {'address': 'Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan', 'authors': ['Masayuki Endo', ',\xa0Hiroshi Sugiyama', ',\xa0Yoshie Harada', '\xa0&\xa0Hisashi Tadakuma']}, {'address': 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['Ryo Iizuka', '\xa0&\xa0Takashi Funatsu']}, {'address': 'Department of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (ASE Graduate School), Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['Ayaka Iguchi', '\xa0&\xa0Shuichi Shoji']}, {'address': 'Research Organization for Nano & Life Innovation, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['Dong Hyun Yoon', '\xa0&\xa0Tetsushi Sekiguchi']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China', 'authors': ['Hao Qi']}, {'address': 'Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan', 'authors': ['Yoshie Harada', '\xa0&\xa0Hisashi Tadakuma']}]",False,"['Takeya Masubuchi', 'Masayuki Endo', 'Ryo Iizuka', 'Ayaka Iguchi', 'Dong Hyun Yoon', 'Tetsushi Sekiguchi', 'Hao Qi', 'Ryosuke Iinuma', 'Yuya Miyazono', 'Shuichi Shoji', 'Takashi Funatsu', 'Hiroshi Sugiyama', 'Yoshie Harada', 'Takuya Ueda', 'Hisashi Tadakuma']","Masubuchi, T., Endo, M., Iizuka, R. et al.

letter,Lifetime-engineered NIR-II nanoparticles unlock multiplexed in vivo imaging,"<p>Deep tissue imaging in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window holds great promise for physiological studies and biomedical applications. However, inhomogeneous signal attenuation in biological matter hampers the application of multiple-wavelength NIR-II probes to multiplexed imaging. Here, we present lanthanide-doped NIR-II nanoparticles with engineered luminescence lifetimes for in vivo quantitative imaging using time-domain multiplexing. To achieve this, we have devised a systematic approach based on controlled energy relay that creates a tunable lifetime range spanning three orders of magnitude with a single emission band. We consistently resolve selected lifetimes from the NIR-II nanoparticle probes at depths of up to 8&#8201;mm in biological tissues, where the signal-to-noise ratio derived from intensity measurements drops below 1.5. We demonstrate that robust lifetime coding is independent of tissue penetration depth, and we apply in vivo multiplexing to identify tumour subtypes in living mice. Our results correlate well with standard ex vivo immunohistochemistry assays, suggesting that luminescence lifetime imaging could be used as a minimally invasive approach for disease diagnosis.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Engineering of Polymers, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Catalysis and Innovative Materials and iChem, Fudan University, Shanghai, China', 'authors': ['Yong Fan', ',\xa0Peiyuan Wang', ',\xa0Rui Wang', ',\xa0Lei Zhou', ',\xa0Xiaomin Li', '\xa0&\xa0Fan Zhang']}, {'address': 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics (CNBP), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia', 'authors': ['Yiqing Lu', ',\xa0Xianlin Zheng', '\xa0&\xa0James A.

article,"Controllable conductive readout in self-assembled, topologically confined ferroelectric domain walls","<p>Charged domain walls in ferroelectrics exhibit a quasi-two-dimensional conduction path coupled to the surrounding polarization. They have been proposed for use as non-volatile memory with non-destructive operation and ultralow energy consumption. Yet the evolution of domain walls during polarization switching makes it challenging to control their location and conductance precisely, a prerequisite for controlled read&#8211;write schemes and for integration in scalable memory devices. Here, we explore and reversibly switch the polarization of square BiFeO<sub>3</sub> nanoislands in a self-assembled array. Each island confines cross-shaped, charged domain walls in a centre-type domain. Electrostatic and geometric boundary conditions induce two stable domain configurations: centre-convergent and centre-divergent. We switch the polarization deterministically back and forth between these two states, which alters the domain wall conductance by three orders of magnitude, while the position of the domain wall remains static because of its confinement within the BiFeO<sub>3</sub> islands.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Lab of New Ceramics and Fine Processing, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Ji Ma', ',\xa0Jing Ma', ',\xa0Renci Peng', ',\xa0Jing Wang', ',\xa0Chen Liu', ',\xa0Mingfeng Chen', ',\xa0Long-Qing Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Ce-Wen Nan']}, {'address': 'Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Qinghua Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Lin Gu']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Jing Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Jinxing Zhang']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Low Dimensional Quantum Physics and Department of Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Meng Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Pu Yu']}, {'address': 'International Center for Quantum Materials and Electron Microscopy Laboratory, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Ning Li', '\xa0&\xa0Peng Gao']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Penn State University, University Park, PA, USA', 'authors': ['Xiaoxing Cheng', '\xa0&\xa0Long-Qing Chen']}]",False,"['Ji Ma', 'Jing Ma', 'Qinghua Zhang', 'Renci Peng', 'Jing Wang', 'Chen Liu', 'Meng Wang', 'Ning Li', 'Mingfeng Chen', 'Xiaoxing Cheng', 'Peng Gao', 'Lin Gu', 'Long-Qing Chen', 'Pu Yu', 'Jinxing Zhang', 'Ce-Wen Nan']","Ma, J., Ma, J., Zhang, Q. et al.

article,Enhanced water splitting under modal strong coupling conditions,"<p>Strong coupling between plasmons and optical modes, such as waveguide or resonator modes, gives rise to a splitting in the plasmon absorption band. As a result, two new hybrid modes are formed that exhibit near-field enhancement effects. These hybrid modes have been exploited to improve light absorption in a number of systems. Here we show that this modal strong coupling between a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot nanocavity mode and a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) facilitates water splitting reactions. We use a gold nanoparticle (Au-NP)/TiO<sub>2</sub>/Au-film structure as a photoanode. This structure exhibits modal strong coupling between the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot nanocavity modes of the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film/Au film and LSPR of the Au NPs. Electronic excitation of the Au NPs is promoted by the optical hybrid modes across a broad range of wavelengths, followed by a hot electron transfer to TiO<sub>2</sub>. A key feature of our structure is that the Au NPs are partially inlaid in the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, which results in an enhancement of the coupling strength and water-oxidation efficiency. We observe an 11-fold increase in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency with respect to a photoanode structure with no Au film. Also, the internal quantum efficiency is enhanced 1.5 times under a strong coupling over that under uncoupled conditions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Institute for Electronic Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan', 'authors': ['Xu Shi', ',\xa0Kosei Ueno', ',\xa0Tomoya Oshikiri', ',\xa0Quan Sun', ',\xa0Keiji Sasaki', '\xa0&\xa0Hiroaki Misawa']}, {'address': 'Department of Applied Chemistry, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan', 'authors': ['Hiroaki Misawa']}]",False,"['Xu Shi', 'Kosei Ueno', 'Tomoya Oshikiri', 'Quan Sun', 'Keiji Sasaki', 'Hiroaki Misawa']","Shi, X., Ueno, K., Oshikiri, T. et al.

article,Tunable thermal transport and reversible thermal conductivity switching in topologically networked bio-inspired materials,"<p>The dynamic control of thermal transport properties in solids must contend with the fact that phonons are inherently broadband. Thus, efforts to create reversible thermal conductivity switches have resulted in only modest on/off ratios, since only a relatively narrow portion of the phononic spectrum is impacted. Here, we report on the ability to modulate the thermal conductivity of topologically networked materials by nearly a factor of four following hydration, through manipulation of the displacement amplitude of atomic vibrations. By varying the network topology, or crosslinked structure, of squid ring teeth-based bio-polymers through tandem-repetition of DNA sequences, we show that this thermal switching ratio can be directly programmed. This on/off ratio in thermal conductivity switching is over a factor of three larger than the current state-of-the-art thermal switch, offering the possibility of engineering thermally conductive biological materials with dynamic responsivity to heat.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA', 'authors': ['John A.

article,Plasmonic meta-electrodes allow intracellular recordings at network level on high-density CMOS-multi-electrode arrays,"<p>The ability to monitor electrogenic cells accurately plays a pivotal role in neuroscience, cardiology and cell biology. Despite pioneering research and long-lasting efforts, the existing methods for intracellular recording of action potentials on the large network scale suffer limitations that prevent their widespread use. Here, we introduce the concept of a meta-electrode, a planar porous electrode that mimics the optical and biological behaviour of three-dimensional plasmonic antennas but also preserves the ability to work as an electrode. Its synergistic combination with plasmonic optoacoustic poration allows commercial complementary metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor multi-electrode arrays to record intracellular action potentials in large cellular networks. We apply this approach to measure signals from human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cells, rodent primary cardiomyocytes and immortalized cell types and demonstrate the possibility of non-invasively testing a variety of relevant drugs.
