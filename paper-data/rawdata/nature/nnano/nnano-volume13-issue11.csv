review article,Ultrafast dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures,"<p>Van der Waals heterostructures are synthetic quantum materials composed of stacks of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) layers. Because the electrons in the atomically thin 2D layers are exposed to layer-to-layer coupling, the properties of van der Waals heterostructures are defined not only by the constituent monolayers, but also by the interactions between the layers. Many fascinating electrical, optical and magnetic properties have recently been reported in different types of van der Waals heterostructures. In this Review, we focus on unique excited-state dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures. TMDC monolayers are the most widely studied 2D semiconductors, featuring prominent exciton states and accessibility to the valley degree of freedom. Many TMDC heterostructures are characterized by a staggered band alignment. This band alignment has profound effects on the evolution of the excited states in heterostructures, including ultrafast charge transfer between the layers, the formation of interlayer excitons, and the existence of long-lived spin and valley polarization in resident carriers. Here we review recent experimental and theoretical efforts to elucidate electron dynamics in TMDC heterostructures, extending from timescales of femtoseconds to microseconds, and comment on the relevance of these effects for potential applications in optoelectronic, valleytronic and spintronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Chenhao Jin"", ""Eric Yue Ma"", ""Ouri Karni"", ""Emma C.

review article,Interlayer valley excitons in heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides,"<p>Stacking different two-dimensional crystals into van der Waals heterostructures provides an exciting approach to designing quantum materials that can harness and extend the already fascinating properties of the constituents. Heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides are particularly attractive for low-dimensional semiconductor optics because they host interlayer excitons&#8212;with electrons and holes localized in different layers&#8212;which inherit valley-contrasting physics from the monolayers and thereby possess various novel and appealing properties compared to other solid-state nanostructures. This Review presents the contemporary experimental and theoretical understanding of these interlayer excitons. We discuss their unique optical properties arising from the underlying valley physics, the strong many-body interactions and electrical control resulting from the electric dipole moment, and the unique effects of a moir&#233; superlattice on the interlayer exciton potential landscape and optical properties.</p>",[],False,"[""Pasqual Rivera"", ""Hongyi Yu"", ""Kyle L.

letter,Electrical tuning of elastic wave propagation in nanomechanical lattices at MHz frequencies,"<p>Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) that operate in the megahertz (MHz) regime allow energy transducibility between different physical domains. For example, they convert optical or electrical signals into mechanical motions and vice versa. This coupling of different physical quantities leads to frequency-tunable NEMS resonators via electromechanical non-linearities. NEMS platforms with single- or low-degrees of freedom have been employed to demonstrate quantum-like effects, such as mode cooling, mechanically induced transparency, Rabi oscillation, two-mode squeezing and phonon lasing. Periodic arrays of NEMS resonators with architected unit cells enable fundamental studies of lattice-based solid-state phenomena, such as bandgaps, energy transport, non-linear dynamics and localization, and topological properties, directly transferrable to on-chip devices. Here we describe one-dimensional, non-linear, nanoelectromechanical lattices (NEML) with active control of the frequency band dispersion in the radio-frequency domain (10&#8211;30&#8201;MHz). The design of our systems is inspired by NEMS-based phonon waveguides and includes the voltage-induced frequency tuning of the individual resonators. Our NEMLs consist of a periodic arrangement of mechanically coupled, free-standing nanomembranes with circular clamped boundaries. This design forms a flexural phononic crystal with a well-defined bandgap, 1.8&#8201;MHz wide. The application of a d.c. gate voltage creates voltage-dependent on-site potentials, which can significantly shift the frequency bands of the device. Additionally, a dynamic modulation of the voltage triggers non-linear effects, which induce the formation of a phononic bandgap in the acoustic branch, analogous to Peierls transition in condensed matter. The gating approach employed here makes the devices more compact than recently proposed systems, whose tunability mostly relies on materials&#8217; compliance and mechanical non-linearities.</p>",[],False,"[""Jinwoong Cha"", ""Chiara Daraio""]","Cha, J., Daraio, C.

letter,"Oscillations, travelling fronts and patterns in a supramolecular system","<p>Supramolecular polymers, such as microtubules, operate under non-equilibrium conditions to drive crucial functions in cells, such as motility, division and organelle transport. In vivo and in vitro size oscillations of individual microtubules (dynamic instabilities) and collective oscillations have been observed. In addition, dynamic spatial structures, like waves and polygons, can form in non-stirred systems. Here we describe an artificial supramolecular polymer made of a perylene diimide derivative that displays oscillations, travelling fronts and centimetre-scale self-organized patterns when pushed far from equilibrium by chemical fuels. Oscillations arise from a positive feedback due to nucleation&#8211;elongation&#8211;fragmentation, and a negative feedback due to size-dependent depolymerization. Travelling fronts and patterns form due to self-assembly induced density differences that cause system-wide convection. In our system, the species responsible for the nonlinear dynamics and those that self-assemble are one and the same. In contrast, other reported oscillating assemblies formed by vesicles, micelles or particles rely on the combination of a known chemical oscillator and a stimuli-responsive system, either by communication through the solvent (for example, by changing pH), or by anchoring one of the species covalently (for example, a Belousov&#8211;Zhabotinsky catalyst). The design of self-oscillating supramolecular polymers and large-scale dissipative structures brings us closer to the creation of more life-like materials that respond to external stimuli similarly to living cells, or to creating artificial autonomous chemical robots.</p>",[],False,"[""Jorge Leira-Iglesias"", ""Alessandra Tassoni"", ""Takuji Adachi"", ""Michael Stich"", ""Thomas M.

article,Electrical half-wave rectification at ferroelectric domain walls,"<p>Domain walls in ferroelectric semiconductors show promise as multifunctional two-dimensional elements for next-generation nanotechnology. Electric fields, for example, can control the direct-current resistance and reversibly switch between insulating and conductive domain-wall states, enabling elementary electronic devices such as gates and transistors. To facilitate electrical signal processing and transformation at the domain-wall level, however, an expansion into the realm of alternating-current technology is required. Here, we demonstrate diode-like alternating-to-direct current conversion based on neutral ferroelectric domain walls in ErMnO<sub>3</sub>. By combining scanning probe and dielectric spectroscopy, we show that the rectification occurs at the tip&#8211;wall contact for frequencies at which the walls are effectively pinned. Using density functional theory, we attribute the responsible transport behaviour at the neutral walls to an accumulation of oxygen defects. The practical frequency regime and magnitude of the direct current output are controlled by the bulk conductivity, establishing electrode&#8211;wall junctions as versatile atomic-scale diodes.</p>",[],False,"[""Jakob Schaab"", ""Sandra H.

article,Nano-imaging of intersubband transitions in van der Waals quantum wells,"<p>The science and applications of electronics and optoelectronics have been driven for decades by progress in the growth of semiconducting heterostructures. Many applications in the infrared and terahertz frequency range exploit transitions between quantized states in semiconductor quantum wells (intersubband transitions). However, current quantum well devices are limited in functionality and versatility by diffusive interfaces and the requirement of lattice-matched growth conditions. Here, we introduce the concept of intersubband transitions in van der Waals quantum wells and report their first experimental observation. Van der Waals quantum wells are naturally formed by two-dimensional materials and hold unexplored potential to overcome the aforementioned limitations&#8212;they form atomically sharp interfaces and can easily be combined into heterostructures without lattice-matching restrictions. We employ near-field local probing to spectrally resolve intersubband transitions with a nanometre-scale spatial resolution and electrostatically control the absorption.

article,Directional lasing in resonant semiconductor nanoantenna arrays,"<p>High-index dielectric and semiconductor nanoparticles supporting strong electric and magnetic resonances have drawn significant attention in recent years. However, until now, there have been no experimental reports of lasing action from such nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate directional lasing, with a low threshold and high quality factor, in active dielectric nanoantenna arrays achieved through a leaky resonance excited in coupled gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanopillars. The leaky resonance is formed by partially breaking a bound state in the continuum generated by the collective, vertical electric dipole resonances excited in the nanopillars for subdiffractive arrays. We control the directionality of the emitted light while maintaining a high quality factor (Q&#8201;=&#8201;2,750). The lasing directivity and wavelength can be tuned via the nanoantenna array geometry and by modifying the gain spectrum of GaAs with temperature.

article,"Highly conductive, stretchable and biocompatible Ag–Au core–sheath nanowire composite for wearable and implantable bioelectronics","<p>Wearable and implantable devices require conductive, stretchable and biocompatible materials.

Here, we report on Ag&#8211;Au nanocomposites composed of ultralong gold-coated silver nanowires in an elastomeric block-copolymer matrix. Owing to the high aspect ratio and percolation network of the Ag&#8211;Au nanowires, the nanocomposites exhibit an optimized conductivity of 41,850&#8201;S&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (maximum of 72,600&#8201;S&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Phase separation in the Ag&#8211;Au nanocomposite during the solvent-drying process generates a microstructure that yields an optimized stretchability of 266% (maximum of 840%). The thick gold sheath deposited on the silver nanowire surface prevents oxidation and silver ion leaching, making the composite biocompatible and highly conductive.

Recently, self-healing chemistry has driven important advances in deformable and reconfigurable electronics, particularly with self-healable electrodes as the key enabler. Unlike polymer substrates with self-healable dynamic nature, the disrupted conducting network is unable to recover its stretchability after damage. Here, we report the observation of self-reconstruction of conducting nanostructures when in contact with a dynamically crosslinked polymer network. This, combined with the self-bonding property of self-healing polymer, allowed subsequent heterogeneous multi-component device integration of interconnects, sensors and light-emitting devices into a single multi-functional system.

article,Nucleic acid hybridization on an electrically reconfigurable network of gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles enables microRNA detection in blood,"<p>There is intense interest in quantifying the levels of microRNA because of its importance as a blood-borne biomarker. The challenge has been to develop methods that can monitor microRNA expression both over broad concentration ranges and in ultralow amounts directly in a patient&#8217;s blood. Here, we show that, through electric-field-induced reconfiguration of a network of gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles modified by probe DNA (DNA&#8211;Au@MNPs), it is possible to create a highly sensitive sensor for direct analysis of nucleic acids in samples as complex as whole blood. The sensor is the first to be able to detect concentrations of microRNA from 10&#8201;aM to 1&#8201;nM in unprocessed blood samples. It can distinguish small variations in microRNA concentrations in blood samples of mice with growing tumours. The ultrasensitive and direct detection of microRNA using an electrically reconfigurable DNA&#8211;Au@MNPs network makes the reported device a promising tool for cancer diagnostics.</p>",[],False,"[""Roya Tavallaie"", ""Joshua McCarroll"", ""Marion Le Grand"", ""Nicholas Ariotti"", ""Wolfgang Schuhmann"", ""Eric Bakker"", ""Richard David Tilley"", ""David Brynn Hibbert"", ""Maria Kavallaris"", ""John Justin Gooding""]","Tavallaie, R., McCarroll, J., Le Grand, M. et al.

article,Gold nanoparticle biodissolution by a freshwater macrophyte and its associated microbiome,"<p>Predicting nanoparticle fate in aquatic environments requires mimicking of ecosystem complexity to observe the geochemical processes affecting their behaviour. Here, 12&#8201;nm Au nanoparticles were added weekly to large-scale freshwater wetland mesocosms. After six months, ~70% of Au was associated with the macrophyte Egeria densa, where, despite the thermodynamic stability of Au<sup>0</sup> in water, the pristine Au<sup>0</sup> nanoparticles were fully oxidized and complexed to cyanide, hydroxyls or thiol ligands. Extracted biofilms growing on E. densa leaves were shown to dissolve Au nanoparticles within days. The Au biodissolution rate was highest for the biofilm with the lowest prevalence of metal-resistant taxa but the highest ability to release cyanide, known to promote Au<sup>0</sup> oxidation and complexation. Macrophytes and the associated microbiome thus form a biologically active system that can be a major sink for nanoparticle accumulation and transformations. Nanoparticle biotransformation in these compartments should not be ignored, even for nanoparticles commonly considered to be stable in the environment.</p>",[],False,"[""Astrid Avellan"", ""Marie Simonin"", ""Eric McGivney"", ""Nathan Bossa"", ""Eleanor Spielman-Sun"", ""Jennifer D.

article,Physical activation of innate immunity by spiky particles,"<p>Microbial biochemicals have been indicated as the primary stimulators of innate immunity, the first line of the body&#8217;s defence against infections. However, the influence of topological features on a microbe&#8217;s surface on immune responses remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate the ability of TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles decorated with nanospikes (spiky particles) to activate and amplify the immune response in vitro and in vivo. The nanospikes exert mechanical stress on the cells, which results in potassium efflux and inflammasome activation in macrophages and dendritic cells during phagocytosis. The spiky particles augment antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the presence of monophosphoryl lipid A and elicit protective immunity against tumour growth and influenza viral infection. The study offers insights into how surface physical cues can tune the activation of innate immunity and provides a basis for engineering particles with increased immunogenicity and adjuvanticity.</p>",[],False,"[""Ji Wang"", ""Hui-Jiuan Chen"", ""Tian Hang"", ""Yang Yu"", ""Guishi Liu"", ""Gen He"", ""Shuai Xiao"", ""Bo-ru Yang"", ""Chengduan Yang"", ""Fanmao Liu"", ""Jun Tao"", ""Mei X.
