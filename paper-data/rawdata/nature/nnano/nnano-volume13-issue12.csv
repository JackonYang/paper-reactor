review article,Emerging hydrovoltaic technology,"<p>Water contains tremendous energy in a variety of forms, but very little of this energy has yet been harnessed. Nanostructured materials can generate electricity on interaction with water, a phenomenon that we term the hydrovoltaic effect, which potentially extends the technical capability of water energy harvesting and enables the creation of self-powered devices. In this Review, starting by describing fundamental properties of water and of water&#8211;solid interfaces, we discuss key aspects pertaining to water&#8211;carbon interactions and basic mechanisms of harvesting water energy with nanostructured materials. Experimental advances in generating electricity from water flows, waves, natural evaporation and moisture are then reviewed to show the correlations in their basic mechanisms and the potential for their integration towards harvesting energy from the water cycle. We further discuss potential device applications of hydrovoltaic technologies, analyse main challenges in improving the energy conversion efficiency and scaling up the output power, and suggest prospects for developments of the emerging technology.</p>",[],False,"[""Zhuhua Zhang"", ""Xuemei Li"", ""Jun Yin"", ""Ying Xu"", ""Wenwen Fei"", ""Minmin Xue"", ""Qin Wang"", ""Jianxin Zhou"", ""Wanlin Guo""]","Zhang, Z., Li, X., Yin, J. et al.

letter,Electrically controlled nuclear polarization of individual atoms,"<p>Nuclear spins serve as sensitive probes in chemistry and materials science and are promising candidates for quantum information processing. NMR, the resonant control of nuclear spins, is a powerful tool for probing local magnetic environments in condensed matter systems, which range from magnetic ordering in high-temperature superconductors and spin liquids to quantum magnetism in nanomagnets. Increasing the sensitivity of NMR to the single-atom scale is challenging as it requires a strong polarization of nuclear spins, well in excess of the low polarizations obtained at thermal equilibrium, as well as driving and detecting them individually. Strong nuclear spin polarization, known as hyperpolarization, can be achieved through hyperfine coupling with electron spins. The fundamental mechanism is the conservation of angular momentum: an electron spin flips and a nuclear spin flops. The nuclear hyperpolarization enables applications such as in vivo magnetic resonance imaging using nanoparticles, and is harnessed for spin-based quantum information processing in quantum dots and doped silicon. Here we polarize the nuclear spins of individual copper atoms on a surface using a spin-polarized current in a scanning tunnelling microscope. By employing the electron&#8211;nuclear flip-flop hyperfine interaction, the spin angular momentum is transferred from tunnelling electrons to the nucleus of individual Cu atoms. The direction and magnitude of the nuclear polarization is controlled by the direction and amplitude of the current. The nuclear polarization permits the detection of the NMR of individual Cu atoms, which is used to sense the local magnetic environment of the Cu electron spin.</p>",[],False,"[""Kai Yang"", ""Philip Willke"", ""Yujeong Bae"", ""Alejandro Ferr\u00f3n"", ""Jose L.

letter,Mechanically controlled quantum interference in graphene break junctions,"<p>The ability to detect and distinguish quantum interference signatures is important for both fundamental research and for the realization of devices such as electron resonators, interferometers and interference-based spin filters. Consistent with the principles of subwavelength optics, the wave nature of electrons can give rise to various types of interference effects, such as Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances, Fano resonances and the Aharonov&#8211;Bohm effect. Quantum interference conductance oscillations have, indeed, been predicted for multiwall carbon nanotube shuttles and telescopes, and arise from atomic-scale displacements between the inner and outer tubes. Previous theoretical work on graphene bilayers indicates that these systems may display similar interference features as a function of the relative position of the two sheets. Experimental verification is, however, still lacking. Graphene nanoconstrictions represent an ideal model system to study quantum transport phenomena due to the electronic coherence and the transverse confinement of the carriers. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of bowtie-shaped nanoconstrictions with mechanically controlled break junctions made from a single layer of graphene. Their electrical conductance displays pronounced oscillations at room temperature, with amplitudes that modulate over an order of magnitude as a function of subnanometre displacements. Surprisingly, the oscillations exhibit a period larger than the graphene lattice constant. Charge-transport calculations show that the periodicity originates from a combination of the quantum interference and lattice commensuration effects of two graphene layers that slide across each other. Our results provide direct experimental observation of a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot-like interference of electron waves that are partially reflected and/or transmitted at the edges of the graphene bilayer overlap region.</p>",[],False,"[""Sabina Caneva"", ""Pascal Gehring"", ""V\u00edctor M.

letter,Anisotropic polarization-induced conductance at a ferroelectric–insulator interface,"<p>Coupling between different degrees of freedom, that is, charge, spin, orbital and lattice, is responsible for emergent phenomena in complex oxide heterostrutures. One example is the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the polar/non-polar LaAlO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (LAO/STO) interface. This is caused by the polar discontinuity and counteracts the electrostatic potential build-up across the LAO film. The ferroelectric polarization at a ferroelectric/insulator interface can also give rise to a polar discontinuity. Depending on the polarization orientation, either electrons or holes are transferred to the interface, to form either a 2DEG or two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG). While recent first-principles modelling predicts the formation of 2DEGs at the ferroelectric/insulator interfaces, experimental evidence of a ferroelectrically induced interfacial 2DEG remains elusive. Here, we report the emergence of strongly anisotropic polarization-induced conductivity at a ferroelectric/insulator interface, which shows a strong dependence on the polarization orientation. By probing the local conductance and ferroelectric polarization over a cross-section of a BiFeO<sub>3</sub>&#8211;TbScO<sub>3</sub> (BFO/TSO) (001) heterostructure, we demonstrate that this interface is conducting along the 109&#176; domain stripes in BFO, whereas it is insulating in the direction perpendicular to these domain stripes. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy and theoretical modelling suggest that the anisotropy of the interfacial conduction is caused by an alternating polarization associated with the ferroelectric domains, producing either electron or hole doping of the BFO/TSO interface.</p>",[],False,"[""Yi Zhang"", ""Haidong Lu"", ""Lin Xie"", ""Xingxu Yan"", ""Tula R.

letter,Deterministic coupling of site-controlled quantum emitters in monolayer WSe2 to plasmonic nanocavities,"<p>Solid-state single-quantum emitters are crucial resources for on-chip photonic quantum technologies and require efficient cavity&#8211;emitter coupling to realize quantum networks beyond the single-node level. Monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub>, a transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor, can host randomly located quantum emitters, while nanobubbles as well as lithographically defined arrays of pillars in contact with the transition metal dichalcogenide act as spatially controlled stressors. The induced strain can then create excitons at defined locations. This ability to create zero-dimensional (0D) excitons anywhere within a 2D material is promising for the development of scalable quantum technologies, but so far lacks mature cavity integration and suffers from low emitter quantum yields. Here we demonstrate a deterministic approach to achieve Purcell enhancement at lithographically defined locations using the sharp corners of a metal nanocube for both electric field enhancement and to deform a 2D material. This nanoplasmonic platform allows the study of the same quantum emitter before and after coupling. For a 3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;4 array of quantum emitters we show Purcell factors of up to 551 (average of 181), single-photon emission rates of up to 42&#8201;MHz and a narrow exciton linewidth as low as 55&#8201;&#956;eV. Furthermore, the use of flux-grown WSe<sub>2</sub> increases the 0D exciton lifetimes to up to 14&#8201;ns and the cavity-enhanced quantum yields from an initial value of 1% to up to 65% (average 44%).</p>",[],False,"[""Yue Luo"", ""Gabriella D.

letter,Subwavelength angle-sensing photodetectors inspired by directional hearing in small animals,"<p>Sensing the direction of sounds gives animals clear evolutionary advantage. For large animals, with an ear-to-ear spacing that exceeds audible sound wavelengths, directional sensing is simply accomplished by recognizing the intensity and time differences of a wave impinging on its two ears. Recent research suggests that in smaller, subwavelength animals, angle sensing can instead rely on a coherent coupling of soundwaves between the two ears. Inspired by this natural design, here we show a subwarvelength photodetection pixel that can measure both the intensity and incident angle of light. It relies on an electrical isolation and optical coupling of two closely spaced Si nanowires that support optical Mie resonances. When these resonators scatter light into the same free-space optical modes, a non-Hermitian coupling results that affords highly sensitive angle determination. By straightforward photocurrent measurements, we can independently quantify the stored optical energy in each nanowire and relate the difference in the stored energy between the wires to the incident angle of a light wave. We exploit this effect to fabricate a subwavelength angle-sensitive pixel with angular sensitivity, &#948;&#952;&#8201;=&#8201;0.32&#176;.</p>",[],False,"[""Soongyu Yi"", ""Ming Zhou"", ""Zongfu Yu"", ""Pengyu Fan"", ""Nader Behdad"", ""Dianmin Lin"", ""Ken Xingze Wang"", ""Shanhui Fan"", ""Mark Brongersma""]","Yi, S., Zhou, M., Yu, Z. et al.

It has been shown that gold nanorods are not cytotoxic and localize within cytoplasmic vesicles following endocytosis, with no nuclear localization, but other studies have reported alterations in gene expression profiles in cells following exposure to gold nanorods, via unknown mechanisms. In this work we describe a pathway that can contribute to this phenomenon. By mapping the intracellular chemical speciation process of gold nanorods, we show that the commonly used Au&#8211;thiol conjugation, which is important for maintaining the noble (inert) properties of gold nanostructures, is altered following endocytosis, resulting in the formation of Au(i)&#8211;thiolates that localize in the nucleus. Furthermore, we show that nuclear localization of the gold species perturbs the dynamic microenvironment within the nucleus and triggers alteration of gene expression in human cells. We demonstrate this using quantitative visualization of ubiquitous DNA G-quadruplex structures, which are sensitive to ionic imbalances, as an indicator of the formation of structural alterations in genomic DNA.</p>",[],False,"[""Diwei Ho"", ""Jessica A.

article,Discrete Hall resistivity contribution from Néel skyrmions in multilayer nanodiscs,<p>Magnetic skyrmions are knot-like quasiparticles. They are candidates for non-volatile data storage in which information is moved between fixed read and write terminals. The read-out operation of skyrmion-based spintronic devices will rely on the electrical detection of a single magnetic skyrmion within a nanostructure. Here we present Pt/Co/Ir nanodiscs that support skyrmions at room temperature. We measured the Hall resistivity and simultaneously imaged the spin texture using magnetic scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. The Hall resistivity is correlated to both the presence and size of the skyrmion. The size-dependent part matches the expected anomalous Hall signal when averaging the magnetization over the entire disc. We observed a resistivity contribution that only depends on the number and sign of skyrmion-like objects present in the disc. Each skyrmion gives rise to 22&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2&#8201;n&#937;&#8201;cm irrespective of its size.

article,Detection and identification of genetic material via single-molecule conductance,"<p>The ongoing discoveries of RNA modalities (for example, non-coding, micro and enhancer) have resulted in an increased desire for detecting, sequencing and identifying RNA segments for applications in food safety, water and environmental protection, plant and animal pathology, clinical diagnosis and research, and bio-security. Here, we demonstrate that single-molecule conductance techniques can be used to extract biologically relevant information from short RNA oligonucleotides, that these measurements are sensitive to attomolar target concentrations, that they are capable of being multiplexed, and that they can detect targets of interest in the presence of other, possibly interfering, RNA sequences. We also demonstrate that the charge transport properties of RNA:DNA hybrids are sensitive to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, thus enabling differentiation between specific serotypes of Escherichia coli. Using a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches, we determine that the conductance sensitivity primarily arises from the effects that the mutations have on the conformational structure of the molecules, rather than from the direct chemical substitutions. We believe that this approach can be further developed to make an electrically based sensor for diagnostic purposes.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuanhui Li"", ""Juan M.

article,A malaria vaccine adjuvant based on recombinant antigen binding to liposomes,"<p>Pfs25 is a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine antigen candidate, but its apparently limited immunogenicity in humans has hindered clinical development. Here, we show that recombinant, polyhistidine-tagged (his-tagged) Pfs25 can be mixed at the time of immunization with pre-formed liposomes containing cobalt porphyrin&#8211;phospholipid, resulting in spontaneous nanoliposome antigen particleization (SNAP). Antigens are stably presented in uniformly orientated display via his-tag insertion in the cobalt porphyrin&#8211;phospholipid bilayer, without covalent modification or disruption of antigen conformation. SNAP immunization of mice and rabbits is well tolerated with minimal local reactogenicity, and results in orders-of-magnitude higher functional antibody generation compared with other &#8216;mix-and-inject&#8217; adjuvants. Serum-stable antigen binding during transit to draining lymph nodes leads to enhanced antigen uptake by phagocytic antigen-presenting cells, with subsequent generation of long-lived, antigen-specific plasma cells. Seamless multiplexing with four additional his-tagged Plasmodium falciparum polypeptides induces strong and balanced antibody production, illustrating the simplicity of developing multistage particulate vaccines with SNAP immunization.</p>",[],False,"[""Wei-Chiao Huang"", ""Bingbing Deng"", ""Cuiyan Lin"", ""Kevin A.

article,Neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles inhibit synovial inflammation and alleviate joint damage in inflammatory arthritis,"<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a common chronic inflammatory disorder and a major cause of disability. Despite the progress made with recent clinical use of anti-cytokine biologics, the response rate of rheumatoid arthritis treatment remains unsatisfactory, owing largely to the complexity of cytokine interactions and the multiplicity of cytokine targets. Here, we show a nanoparticle-based broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory strategy for rheumatoid arthritis management. By fusing neutrophil membrane onto polymeric cores, we prepare neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles that inherit the antigenic exterior and associated membrane functions of the source cells, which makes them ideal decoys of neutrophil-targeted biological molecules. It is shown that these nanoparticles can neutralize proinflammatory cytokines, suppress synovial inflammation, target deep into the cartilage matrix, and provide strong chondroprotection against joint damage. In a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis and a human transgenic mouse model of arthritis, the neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles show significant therapeutic efficacy by ameliorating joint damage and suppressing overall arthritis severity.</p>",[],False,"[""Qiangzhe Zhang"", ""Diana Dehaini"", ""Yue Zhang"", ""Julia Zhou"", ""Xiangyu Chen"", ""Lifen Zhang"", ""Ronnie H.
