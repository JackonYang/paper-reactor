review article,Environmental performance of graphene-based 3D macrostructures,"<p>Three-dimensional macrostructures (3DMs) of graphene and graphene oxide are being developed for fast and efficient removal of contaminants from water and air. The large specific surface area, versatile surface chemistry and exceptional mechanical properties of graphene-based nanosheets enable the formation of robust and high-performance 3DMs such as sponges, membranes, beads and fibres. However, little is known about the relationship between the materials properties of graphene-based 3DMs and their environmental performance. In this Review, we summarize the self-assembly and environmental applications of graphene-based 3DMs in removing contaminants from water and air. We also develop the critical link between the materials properties of 3DMs and their environmental performance, and identify the key parameters that influence their capacities for contaminant removal.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada', 'authors': ['Nariman Yousefi', '\xa0&\xa0Nathalie Tufenkji']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA', 'authors': ['Xinglin Lu', '\xa0&\xa0Menachem Elimelech']}]",False,"['Nariman Yousefi', 'Xinglin Lu', 'Menachem Elimelech', 'Nathalie Tufenkji']","Yousefi, N., Lu, X., Elimelech, M. et al.

letter,Coherent control of a hybrid superconducting circuit made with graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures,"<p>Quantum coherence and control is foundational to the science and engineering of quantum systems. In van der Waals materials, the collective coherent behaviour of carriers has been probed successfully by transport measurements. However, temporal coherence and control, as exemplified by manipulating a single quantum degree of freedom, remains to be verified. Here we demonstrate such coherence and control of a superconducting circuit incorporating graphene-based Josephson junctions. Furthermore, we show that this device can be operated as a voltage-tunable transmon qubit, whose spectrum reflects the electronic properties of massless Dirac fermions travelling ballistically. In addition to the potential for advancing extensible quantum computing technology, our results represent a new approach to studying van der Waals materials using microwave photons in coherent quantum circuits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Joel I-Jan Wang', ',\xa0Daniel L.

letter,Nonlinear light generation in topological nanostructures,"<p>Topological photonics has emerged as a route to robust optical circuitry protected against disorder and now includes demonstrations such as topologically protected lasing and single-photon transport. Recently, nonlinear optical topological structures have attracted special theoretical interest, as they enable tuning of topological properties by a change in the light intensity and can break optical reciprocity to realize full topological protection. However, so far, non-reciprocal topological states have only been realized using magneto-optical materials and macroscopic set-ups with external magnets, which is not feasible for nanoscale integration. Here we report the observation of a third-harmonic signal from a topologically non-trivial zigzag array of dielectric nanoparticles and the demonstration of strong enhancement of the nonlinear photon generation at the edge states of the array. The signal enhancement is due to the interaction between the Mie resonances of silicon nanoparticles and the topological localization of the electric field at the edges. The system is also robust against various perturbations and structural defects. Moreover, we show that the interplay between topology, bi-anisotropy and nonlinearity makes parametric photon generation tunable and non-reciprocal. Our study brings nonlinear topological photonics concepts to the realm of nanoscience.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Nonlinear Physics Centre, Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia', 'authors': ['Sergey Kruk', ',\xa0Alexander Poddubny', ',\xa0Daria Smirnova', ',\xa0Lei Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Yuri Kivshar']}, {'address': 'ITMO University, St Petersburg, Russia', 'authors': ['Alexander Poddubny', ',\xa0Alexey Slobozhanyuk', '\xa0&\xa0Yuri Kivshar']}, {'address': 'Ioffe Institute, St Petersburg, Russia', 'authors': ['Alexander Poddubny']}, {'address': 'Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Science, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia', 'authors': ['Daria Smirnova']}, {'address': 'Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia', 'authors': ['Alexander Shorokhov']}, {'address': 'Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA', 'authors': ['Ivan Kravchenko']}, {'address': 'Laser Physics Centre,  Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia', 'authors': ['Barry Luther-Davies']}]",False,"['Sergey Kruk', 'Alexander Poddubny', 'Daria Smirnova', 'Lei Wang', 'Alexey Slobozhanyuk', 'Alexander Shorokhov', 'Ivan Kravchenko', 'Barry Luther-Davies', 'Yuri Kivshar']","Kruk, S., Poddubny, A., Smirnova, D. et al.

letter,"A piezoelectric, strain-controlled antiferromagnetic memory insensitive to magnetic fields","<p>Spintronic devices based on antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials hold the promise of fast switching speeds and robustness against magnetic fields. Different device concepts have been predicted and experimentally demonstrated, such as low-temperature AFM tunnel junctions that operate as spin-valves, or room-temperature AFM memory, for which either thermal heating in combination with magnetic fields or N&#233;el spin&#8211;orbit torque is used for the information writing process. On the other hand, piezoelectric materials were employed to control magnetism by electric fields in multiferroic heterostructures, which suppresses Joule heating caused by switching currents and may enable low-energy-consuming electronic devices. Here, we combine the two material classes to explore changes in the resistance of the high-N&#233;el-temperature antiferromagnet MnPt induced by piezoelectric strain. We find two non-volatile resistance states at room temperature and zero electric field that are stable in magnetic fields up to 60&#8201;T. Furthermore, the strain-induced resistance switching process is insensitive to magnetic fields. Integration in a tunnel junction can further amplify the electroresistance. The tunnelling anisotropic magnetoresistance reaches ~11.2% at room temperature. Overall, we demonstrate a piezoelectric, strain-controlled AFM memory that is fully operational in strong magnetic fields and has the potential for low-energy and high-density memory applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Han Yan', ',\xa0Zexin Feng', ',\xa0Xiaoning Wang', ',\xa0Zexiang Hu', ',\xa0Hui Wang', ',\xa0Hui Hua', ',\xa0Wenkuo Lu', ',\xa0Jingmin Wang', ',\xa0Peixin Qin', ',\xa0Huixin Guo', ',\xa0Xiaorong Zhou', ',\xa0Zhaoguogang Leng', ',\xa0Chengbao Jiang', ',\xa0Michael Coey', '\xa0&\xa0Zhiqi Liu']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA', 'authors': ['Shunli Shang', '\xa0&\xa0Zikui Liu']}, {'address': 'Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China', 'authors': ['Jinhua Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Zengwei Zhu']}, {'address': 'School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China', 'authors': ['Jinhua Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Zengwei Zhu']}, {'address': 'School of Materials Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China', 'authors': ['Zuhuang Chen']}, {'address': 'Department of Pure and Applied Physics, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland', 'authors': ['Michael Coey']}]",False,"['Han Yan', 'Zexin Feng', 'Shunli Shang', 'Xiaoning Wang', 'Zexiang Hu', 'Jinhua Wang', 'Zengwei Zhu', 'Hui Wang', 'Zuhuang Chen', 'Hui Hua', 'Wenkuo Lu', 'Jingmin Wang', 'Peixin Qin', 'Huixin Guo', 'Xiaorong Zhou', 'Zhaoguogang Leng', 'Zikui Liu', 'Chengbao Jiang', 'Michael Coey', 'Zhiqi Liu']","Yan, H., Feng, Z., Shang, S. et al.A piezoelectric, strain-controlled antiferromagnetic memory insensitive to magnetic fields.

letter,Spin read-out in atomic qubits in an all-epitaxial three-dimensional transistor,"<p>The realization of the surface code for topological error correction is an essential step towards a universal quantum computer. For single-atom qubits in silicon, the need to control and read out qubits synchronously and in parallel requires the formation of a two-dimensional array of qubits with control electrodes patterned above and below this qubit layer. This vertical three-dimensional device architecture requires the ability to pattern dopants in multiple, vertically separated planes of the silicon crystal with nanometre precision interlayer alignment. Additionally, the dopants must not diffuse or segregate during the silicon encapsulation. Critical components of this architecture&#8212;such as nanowires, single-atom transistors and single-electron transistors&#8211;have been realized on one atomic plane by patterning phosphorus dopants in silicon using scanning tunnelling microscope hydrogen resist lithography. Here, we extend this to three dimensions and demonstrate single-shot spin read-out with 97.9% measurement fidelity of a phosphorus dopant qubit within a vertically gated single-electron transistor with &lt;5&#8201;nm interlayer alignment accuracy. Our strategy ensures the formation of a fully crystalline transistor using just two atomic species: phosphorus and silicon.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communications Technology, School of Physics, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia', 'authors': ['Matthias Koch', ',\xa0Joris G.

letter,Poling of an artificial magneto-toroidal crystal,"<p>Although ferromagnetism is known to be of enormous importance, the exploitation of materials with a compensated (for example, antiferromagnetic) arrangement of long-range ordered magnetic moments is still in its infancy. Antiferromagnetism is more robust against external perturbations, exhibits ultrafast responses of the spin system and is key to phenomena such as exchange bias, magnetically induced ferroelectricity or certain magnetoresistance phenomena. However, there is no conjugate field for the manipulation of antiferromagnetic order, hindering both its observation and direct manipulation. Only recently, direct poling of a particular antiferromagnet was achieved with spintronic approaches. An interesting alternative to antiferromagnetism is ferrotoroidicity&#8212;a recently established fourth form of ferroic order. This is defined as a vortex-like magnetic state with zero net magnetization, yet with a spontaneously occurring toroidal moment. As a hallmark of ferroic order, there must be a conjugate field that can manipulate the order parameter. For ferrotoroidic materials, this is a toroidal field&#8212;a magnetic vortex field violating both space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry analogous to the toroidal moment. However, the nature and generation of the toroidal field remain elusive for conventional crystalline systems. Here, we demonstrate the creation of an artificial crystal consisting of mesoscopic planar nanomagnets with a magneto-toroidal-ordered ground state. Effective toroidal fields of either sign are applied by scanning a magnetic tip over the crystal. Thus, we achieve local control over the orientation of the toroidal moment despite its zero net magnetization.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory for Multifunctional Ferroic Materials, Department of Materials, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Jannis Lehmann', '\xa0&\xa0Manfred Fiebig']}, {'address': 'Laboratory for Mesoscopic Systems, Department of Materials, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Claire Donnelly', '\xa0&\xa0Laura J.

letter,Giant intrinsic photoresponse in pristine graphene,"<p>When the Fermi level is aligned with the Dirac point of graphene, reduced charge screening greatly enhances electron&#8211;electron scattering. In an optically excited system, the kinematics of electron&#8211;electron scattering in Dirac fermions is predicted to give rise to novel optoelectronic phenomena. In this paper, we report on the observation of an intrinsic photocurrent in graphene, which occurs in a different parameter regime from all the previously observed photothermoelectric or photovoltaic photocurrents in graphene: the photocurrent emerges exclusively at the charge neutrality point, requiring no finite doping. Unlike other photocurrent types that are enhanced near p&#8211;n or contact junctions, the photocurrent observed in our work arises near the edges/corners. By systematic data analyses, we show that the phenomenon stems from the unique electron&#8211;electron scattering kinematics in charge-neutral graphene. Our results not only highlight the intriguing electron dynamics in the optoelectronic response of Dirac fermions, but also offer a new scheme for photodetection and energy harvesting applications based on intrinsic, charge-neutral Dirac fermions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Qiong Ma', ',\xa0Jian Feng Kong', ',\xa0Yuan Cao', ',\xa0Thao H.

letter,Self-healing of electrical damage in polymers using superparamagnetic nanoparticles,"<p>High-voltage power transmission in electrical grids requires reliable and durable dielectric polymers for wire insulation. Electrical treeing caused by high, local electric fields is a damaging process that leads to structure degradation and electrical conduction of dielectric materials, and ultimately, to catastrophic failure of the devices. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of less than 0.1 volume per cent of superparamagnetic nanoparticles into a thermoplastic polymer enables the repair of regions damaged by electrical treeing and the restoration of the insulating properties.

letter,Ultrasoft electronics to monitor dynamically pulsing cardiomyocytes,"<p>In biointegrated electronics, the facile control of mechanical properties such as softness and stretchability in electronic devices is necessary to minimize the perturbation of motions inherent in biological systems. For in vitro studies, multielectrode-embedded dishes and other rigid devices have been widely used. Soft or flexible electronics on plastic or elastomeric substrates offer promising new advantages such as decreasing physical stress and/or applying mechanical stimuli. Recently, owing to the introduction of macroporous plastic substrates with nanofibre scaffolds, three-dimensional electrophysiological mapping of cardiomyocytes has been demonstrated. However, quantitatively monitoring cells that exhibit significant dynamical motions via electric probes over a long period without affecting their natural motion remains a challenge. Here, we present ultrasoft electronics with nanomeshes that monitor the field potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes on a hydrogel, while enabling them to move dynamically without interference. Owing to the extraordinary softness of the nanomeshes, nanomesh-attached cardiomyocytes exhibit contraction and relaxation motions comparable to that of cardiomyocytes without attached nanomeshes. Our multilayered nanomesh devices maintain reliable operations in a liquid environment, enabling the recording of field potentials of the cardiomyocytes over a period of 96&#8201;h without significant degradation of the nanomesh devices or damage of the cardiomyocytes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Information Systems, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['Sunghoon Lee', ',\xa0Dongmin Kim', ',\xa0Mami Mori', ',\xa0Tomoyuki Yokota', ',\xa0Masaki Sekino', '\xa0&\xa0Takao Someya']}, {'address': 'Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women’s Medical University, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['Daisuke Sasaki', ',\xa0Katsuhisa Matsuura', '\xa0&\xa0Tatsuya Shimizu']}, {'address': 'Thin-Film Device Laboratory, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan', 'authors': ['Hyunjae Lee', ',\xa0Kenjiro Fukuda', '\xa0&\xa0Takao Someya']}, {'address': 'Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), RIKEN, Saitama, Japan', 'authors': ['Sungjun Park', ',\xa0Kenjiro Fukuda', '\xa0&\xa0Takao Someya']}]",False,"['Sunghoon Lee', 'Daisuke Sasaki', 'Dongmin Kim', 'Mami Mori', 'Tomoyuki Yokota', 'Hyunjae Lee', 'Sungjun Park', 'Kenjiro Fukuda', 'Masaki Sekino', 'Katsuhisa Matsuura', 'Tatsuya Shimizu', 'Takao Someya']","Lee, S., Sasaki, D., Kim, D. et al.

article,Nanomechanical pump–probe measurements of insulating electronic states in a carbon nanotube,"<p>Transport measurements have been an indispensable tool in studying conducting states of matter. However, there exists a large set of interesting states that are insulating, often due to electronic interactions or topology, and are difficult to probe via transport. Here, through an experiment on carbon nanotubes, we present a new approach capable of measuring insulating electronic states through their back action on nanomechanical motion. We use a mechanical pump&#8211;probe scheme, allowing the detection of shifts in both frequency and dissipation rate of mechanical vibrational modes, in an overall insulating system. As an example, we use this method to probe the non-conducting configurations of a double quantum dot, allowing us to observe the theoretically predicted signature of nanomechanical back action resulting from a coherently tunnelling electron. The technique opens a new way for measuring the internal electronic structure of a growing variety of insulating states in one- and two-dimensional systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel', 'authors': ['Ilya Khivrich', '\xa0&\xa0Shahal Ilani']}, {'address': 'Institute for Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Aashish A.

article,Microfluidics-enabled orientation and microstructure control of macroscopic graphene fibres,"<p>Macroscopic graphene structures such as graphene papers and fibres can be manufactured from individual two-dimensional graphene oxide sheets by a fluidics-enabled assembling process. However, achieving high thermal-mechanical and electrical properties is still challenging due to non-optimized microstructures and morphology. Here, we report graphene structures with tunable graphene sheet alignment and orientation, obtained via microfluidic design, enabling strong size and geometry confinements and control over flow patterns. Thin flat channels can be used to fabricate macroscopic graphene structures with perfectly stacked sheets that exhibit superior thermal and electrical conductivities and improved mechanical strength. We attribute the observed shape and size confinements to the flat distribution of shear stress from the anisotropic microchannel walls and the enhanced shear thinning degree of large graphene oxide sheets in solution. Elongational and step expansion flows are created to produce large-scale graphene tubes and rods with horizontally and perpendicularly aligned graphene sheets by tuning the elongational and extensional shear rates, respectively.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA', 'authors': ['Guoqing Xin', ',\xa0Weiguang Zhu', ',\xa0Yanxiang Deng', ',\xa0Jie Cheng', ',\xa0Lucy T.

article,A DNA nanomachine chemically resolves lysosomes in live cells,"<p>Lysosomes are multifunctional, subcellular organelles with roles in plasma membrane repair, autophagy, pathogen degradation and nutrient sensing. Dysfunctional lysosomes underlie Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and rare lysosomal storage diseases, but their contributions to these pathophysiologies are unclear. Live imaging has revealed lysosome subpopulations with different physical characteristics including dynamics, morphology or cellular localization. Here, we chemically resolve lysosome subpopulations using a DNA-based combination reporter that quantitatively images pH and chloride simultaneously in the same lysosome while retaining single-lysosome information in live cells. We call this technology two-ion measurement or 2-IM. 2-IM of lysosomes in primary skin fibroblasts derived from healthy individuals shows two main lysosome populations, one of which is absent in primary cells derived from patients with Niemann&#8211;Pick disease. When patient cells are treated with relevant therapeutics, the second population re-emerges. Chemically resolving lysosomes by 2-IM could enable decoding the mechanistic underpinnings of lysosomal diseases, monitoring disease progression or evaluating therapeutic efficacy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['KaHo Leung', ',\xa0Kasturi Chakraborty', ',\xa0Anand Saminathan', '\xa0&\xa0Yamuna Krishnan']}, {'address': 'Grossman Institute of Neuroscience, Quantitative Biology and Human Behavior, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['KaHo Leung', ',\xa0Kasturi Chakraborty', ',\xa0Anand Saminathan', '\xa0&\xa0Yamuna Krishnan']}]",False,"['KaHo Leung', 'Kasturi Chakraborty', 'Anand Saminathan', 'Yamuna Krishnan']","Leung, K., Chakraborty, K., Saminathan, A. et al.A DNA nanomachine chemically resolves lysosomes in live cells.

article,Binding to nanopatterned antigens is dominated by the spatial tolerance of antibodies,"<p>Although repetitive patterns of antigens are crucial for certain immune responses, an understanding of how antibodies bind and dynamically interact with various spatial arrangements of molecules is lacking. Hence, we introduced a new method in which molecularly precise nanoscale patterns of antigens are displayed using DNA origami and immobilized in a surface plasmon resonance set-up. Using antibodies with identical antigen-binding domains, we found that all the subclasses and isotypes studied bind bivalently to two antigens separated at distances that range from 3 to 17&#8201;nm. The binding affinities of these antibodies change with the antigen distances, with a distinct preference for antigens separated by approximately 16&#8201;nm, and considerable differences in spatial tolerance exist between IgM and IgG and between low- and high-affinity antibodies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden', 'authors': ['Alan Shaw', ',\xa0Ian T.
