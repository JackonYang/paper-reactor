letter,Observation of ballistic avalanche phenomena in nanoscale vertical InSe/BP heterostructures,"<p>Impact ionization, which supports carrier multiplication, is promising for applications in single photon detection and sharp threshold swing field effect devices. However, initiating the impact ionization of avalanche breakdown requires a high applied electric field in a long active region, which hampers carrier multiplication with a high gain, low bias and superior noise performance. Here we report the observation of ballistic avalanche phenomena in sub-mean free path (MFP) scaled vertical InSe/black phosphorus (BP) heterostructures. We use these heterojunctions to fabricate avalanche photodetectors (APDs) with a sensitive mid-infrared light detection (4&#8201;&#956;m wavelength) and impact ionization transistors with a steep subthreshold swing (&lt;0.25&#8201;mV&#8201;dec<sup>&#8211;1</sup>). The devices show a low avalanche threshold (&lt;1&#8201;V), low noise figure and distinctive density spectral shape. Our transport measurements suggest that the breakdown originates from a ballistic avalanche phenomenon, where the sub-MFP BP channel support the lattice impact ionization by electrons and holes and the abrupt current amplification without scattering from the obstacles in a deterministic nature. Our results provide new strategies for the development of advanced photodetectors via efficient carrier manipulation at the nanoscale.</p>",[],False,"[""Anyuan Gao"", ""Jiawei Lai"", ""Yaojia Wang"", ""Zhen Zhu"", ""Junwen Zeng"", ""Geliang Yu"", ""Naizhou Wang"", ""Wenchao Chen"", ""Tianjun Cao"", ""Weida Hu"", ""Dong Sun"", ""Xianhui Chen"", ""Feng Miao"", ""Yi Shi"", ""Xiaomu Wang""]","Gao, A., Lai, J., Wang, Y. et al.

letter,Crested two-dimensional transistors,"<p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, albeit promising candidates for applications in electronics and optoelectronics, are still limited by their low electrical mobility under ambient conditions. Efforts to improve device performance through a variety of routes, such as modification of contact metals and gate dielectrics or encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride, have yielded limited success at room temperature. Here, we report a large increase in the performance of TMD field-effect transistors operating under ambient conditions, achieved by engineering the substrate&#8217;s surface morphology. For MoS<sub>2</sub> transistors fabricated on crested substrates, we observed an almost two orders of magnitude increase in carrier mobility compared to standard devices, as well as very high saturation currents. The mechanical strain in TMDs has been predicted to boost carrier mobility, and has been shown to influence the local bandgap and quantum emission properties of TMDs. With comprehensive investigation of different dielectric environments and morphologies, we demonstrate that the substrate&#8217;s increased corrugation, with its resulting strain field, is the dominant factor driving performance enhancement. This strategy is universally valid for other semiconducting TMD materials, either p-doped or n-doped, opening them up for applications in heterogeneous integrated electronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Tao Liu"", ""Song Liu"", ""Kun-Hua Tu"", ""Hennrik Schmidt"", ""Leiqiang Chu"", ""Du Xiang"", ""Jens Martin"", ""Goki Eda"", ""Caroline A.

letter,Achromatic metalens array for full-colour light-field imaging,"<p>A light-field camera captures both the intensity and the direction of incoming light. This enables a user to refocus pictures and afterwards reconstruct information on the depth of field. Research on light-field imaging can be divided into two components: acquisition and rendering. Microlens arrays have been used for acquisition, but obtaining broadband achromatic images with no spherical aberration remains challenging. Here, we describe a metalens array made of gallium nitride (GaN) nanoantennas that can be used to capture light-field information and demonstrate a full-colour light-field camera devoid of chromatic aberration. The metalens array contains an array of 60&#8201;&#215;&#8201;60 metalenses with diameters of 21.65&#8201;&#956;m. The camera has a diffraction-limited resolution of 1.95&#8201;&#956;m under white light illumination.

article,Vanishing skyrmion Hall effect at the angular momentum compensation temperature of a ferrimagnet,"<p>In the presence of a magnetic field, the flow of charged particles in a conductor is deflected from the direction of the applied force, which gives rise to the ordinary Hall effect. Analogously, moving skyrmions with non-zero topological charges and finite fictitious magnetic fields exhibit the skyrmion Hall effect, which is detrimental for applications such as skyrmion racetrack memory. It was predicted that the skyrmion Hall effect vanishes for antiferromagnetic skyrmions because their fictitious magnetic field, proportional to net spin density, is zero. Here we investigate the current-driven transverse elongation of pinned ferrimagnetic bubbles. We estimate the skyrmion Hall effect from the angle between the current and the bubble elongation directions. The angle and, hence, the skyrmion Hall effect vanishes at the angular momentum compensation temperature where the net spin density vanishes. Furthermore, our study establishes a direct connection between the fictitious magnetic field and the spin density.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuushou Hirata"", ""Duck-Ho Kim"", ""Se Kwon Kim"", ""Dong-Kyu Lee"", ""Se-Hyeok Oh"", ""Dae-Yun Kim"", ""Tomoe Nishimura"", ""Takaya Okuno"", ""Yasuhiro Futakawa"", ""Hiroki Yoshikawa"", ""Arata Tsukamoto"", ""Yaroslav Tserkovnyak"", ""Yoichi Shiota"", ""Takahiro Moriyama"", ""Sug-Bong Choe"", ""Kyung-Jin Lee"", ""Teruo Ono""]","Hirata, Y., Kim, DH., Kim, S.K. et al.

article,Pushing the limits of optical information storage using deep learning,"<p>Diffraction drastically limits the bit density in optical data storage. To increase the storage density, alternative strategies involving supplementary recording dimensions and robust readout schemes must be explored. Here, we propose to encode multiple bits of information in the geometry of subwavelength dielectric nanostructures. A crucial problem in high-density information storage concepts is the robustness of the information readout with respect to fabrication errors and experimental noise. Using a machine-learning-based approach in which the scattering spectra are analysed by an artificial neural network, we achieve quasi-error-free readout of sequences of up to 9&#8201;bits, encoded in top-down fabricated silicon nanostructures. We demonstrate that probing few wavelengths instead of the entire spectrum is sufficient for robust information retrieval and that the readout can be further simplified, exploiting the RGB values from microscopy images.

article,Unravelling inherent electrocatalysis of mixed-conducting oxide activated by metal nanoparticle for fuel cell electrodes,"<p>Highly active metal nanoparticles are desired to serve in high-temperature electrocatalysis, for example, in solid oxide electrochemical cells. Unfortunately, the low thermal stability of nanosized particles and the sophisticated interface requirement for electrode structures to support concurrent ionic and electronic transport make it hard to identify the exact catalytic role of nanoparticles embedded within complex electrode architectures. Here we present an accurate analysis of the reactivity of oxide electrodes boosted by metal nanoparticles, where all particles participate in the reaction. Monodisperse particles (Pt, Pd, Au and Co), 10&#8201;nm in size and stable at high temperature (more than 600&#8201;&#176;C), are uniformly distributed onto mixed-conducting oxide electrodes as a model electrochemical cell via self-assembled nanopatterning. We identify how the metal catalysts activate hydrogen electrooxidation on the ceria-based electrode surface and quantify how rapidly the reaction rate increases with proper choice of metal.

article,DNA nanodevices map enzymatic activity in organelles,"<p>Cellular reporters of enzyme activity are based on either fluorescent proteins or small molecules. Such reporters provide information corresponding to wherever inside cells the enzyme is maximally active and preclude minor populations present in subcellular compartments. Here we describe a chemical imaging strategy to selectively interrogate minor, subcellular pools of enzymatic activity. This new technology confines the detection chemistry to a designated organelle, enabling imaging of enzymatic cleavage exclusively within the organelle. We have thus quantitatively mapped disulfide reduction exclusively in endosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans and identified that exchange is mediated by minor populations of the enzymes PDI-3 and TRX-1 resident in endosomes. Impeding intra-endosomal disulfide reduction by knocking down TRX-1 protects nematodes from infection by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, revealing the importance of this minor pool of endosomal TRX-1. TRX-1 also mediates endosomal disulfide reduction in human cells.

article,Immunoglobulin deposition on biomolecule corona determines complement opsonization efficiency of preclinical and clinical nanoparticles,"<p>Deposition of complement factors (opsonization) on nanoparticles may promote clearance from the blood by macrophages and trigger proinflammatory responses, but the mechanisms regulating the efficiency of complement activation are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that opsonization of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoworms with the third complement protein (C3) was dependent on the biomolecule corona of the nanoparticles. Here we show that natural antibodies play a critical role in C3 opsonization of SPIO nanoworms and a range of clinically approved nanopharmaceuticals. The dependency of C3 opsonization on immunoglobulin binding is almost universal and is observed regardless of the complement activation pathway. Only a few surface-bound immunoglobulin molecules are needed to trigger complement activation and opsonization. Although the total amount of plasma proteins adsorbed on nanoparticles does not determine C3 deposition efficiency, the biomolecule corona per se enhances immunoglobulin binding to all nanoparticle types. We therefore show that natural antibodies represent a link between biomolecule corona and C3 opsonization, and may determine individual complement responses to nanomedicines.</p>",[],False,"[""Vivian P.

This leads to enhanced therapeutic efficacy of cGAMP, inhibition of tumour growth, increased rates of long-term survival, improved response to immune checkpoint blockade and induction of immunological memory that protects against tumour rechallenge.

article,Self-assembled peptide–poloxamine nanoparticles enable in vitro and in vivo genome restoration for cystic fibrosis,"<p>Developing safe and efficient non-viral delivery systems remains a major challenge for in vivo applications of gene therapy, especially in cystic fibrosis. Unlike conventional cationic polymers or lipids, the emerging poloxamine-based copolymers display promising in vivo gene delivery capabilities. However, poloxamines are invalid for in vitro applications and their in vivo transfection efficiency is still low compared with viral vectors. Here, we show that peptides developed by modular design approaches can spontaneously form compact and monodisperse nanoparticles with poloxamines and nucleic acids via self-assembly. Both messenger RNA and plasmid DNA expression mediated by peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles are greatly boosted in vitro and in the lungs of cystic fibrosis mice with negligible toxicity. Peptide&#8211;poloxamine nanoparticles containing integrating vectors enable successful in vitro and in vivo long-term restoration of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency with a safe integration profile. Our dataset provides a new framework for designing non-viral gene delivery systems qualified for in vivo genetic modifications.</p>",[],False,"[""Shan Guan"", ""Antje Munder"", ""Silke Hedtfeld"", ""Peter Braubach"", ""Silke Glage"", ""Longgui Zhang"", ""Stefan Lienenklaus"", ""Anja Schultze"", ""G\u00fcnther Hasenpusch"", ""Wiebke Garrels"", ""Frauke Stanke"", ""Csaba Miskey"", ""Sarah M.
