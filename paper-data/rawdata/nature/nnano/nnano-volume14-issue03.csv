letter,Observation of ballistic avalanche phenomena in nanoscale vertical InSe/BP heterostructures,"<p>Impact ionization, which supports carrier multiplication, is promising for applications in single photon detection and sharp threshold swing field effect devices. However, initiating the impact ionization of avalanche breakdown requires a high applied electric field in a long active region, which hampers carrier multiplication with a high gain, low bias and superior noise performance. Here we report the observation of ballistic avalanche phenomena in sub-mean free path (MFP) scaled vertical InSe/black phosphorus (BP) heterostructures. We use these heterojunctions to fabricate avalanche photodetectors (APDs) with a sensitive mid-infrared light detection (4&#8201;&#956;m wavelength) and impact ionization transistors with a steep subthreshold swing (&lt;0.25&#8201;mV&#8201;dec<sup>&#8211;1</sup>). The devices show a low avalanche threshold (&lt;1&#8201;V), low noise figure and distinctive density spectral shape. Our transport measurements suggest that the breakdown originates from a ballistic avalanche phenomenon, where the sub-MFP BP channel support the lattice impact ionization by electrons and holes and the abrupt current amplification without scattering from the obstacles in a deterministic nature. Our results provide new strategies for the development of advanced photodetectors via efficient carrier manipulation at the nanoscale.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China', 'authors': ['Anyuan Gao', ',\xa0Yaojia Wang', ',\xa0Junwen Zeng', ',\xa0Geliang Yu', ',\xa0Tianjun Cao', ',\xa0Feng Miao', ',\xa0Yi Shi', '\xa0&\xa0Xiaomu Wang']}, {'address': 'International Centre for Quantum Materials, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Jiawei Lai', '\xa0&\xa0Dong Sun']}, {'address': 'Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Zhen Zhu']}, {'address': 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Science at Microscale and Department of Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China', 'authors': ['Naizhou Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Xianhui Chen']}, {'address': 'Key Laboratory of Strongly Coupled Quantum Matter Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China', 'authors': ['Naizhou Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Xianhui Chen']}, {'address': 'College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, ZJU-UIUC Institute, Zhejiang University, Haining, China', 'authors': ['Wenchao Chen']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Infrared Physics, Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China', 'authors': ['Weida Hu']}, {'address': 'Collaborative Innovation Centre of Quantum Matter, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Dong Sun']}]",False,"['Anyuan Gao', 'Jiawei Lai', 'Yaojia Wang', 'Zhen Zhu', 'Junwen Zeng', 'Geliang Yu', 'Naizhou Wang', 'Wenchao Chen', 'Tianjun Cao', 'Weida Hu', 'Dong Sun', 'Xianhui Chen', 'Feng Miao', 'Yi Shi', 'Xiaomu Wang']","Gao, A., Lai, J., Wang, Y. et al.

letter,Crested two-dimensional transistors,"<p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, albeit promising candidates for applications in electronics and optoelectronics, are still limited by their low electrical mobility under ambient conditions. Efforts to improve device performance through a variety of routes, such as modification of contact metals and gate dielectrics or encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride, have yielded limited success at room temperature. Here, we report a large increase in the performance of TMD field-effect transistors operating under ambient conditions, achieved by engineering the substrate&#8217;s surface morphology. For MoS<sub>2</sub> transistors fabricated on crested substrates, we observed an almost two orders of magnitude increase in carrier mobility compared to standard devices, as well as very high saturation currents. The mechanical strain in TMDs has been predicted to boost carrier mobility, and has been shown to influence the local bandgap and quantum emission properties of TMDs. With comprehensive investigation of different dielectric environments and morphologies, we demonstrate that the substrate&#8217;s increased corrugation, with its resulting strain field, is the dominant factor driving performance enhancement. This strategy is universally valid for other semiconducting TMD materials, either p-doped or n-doped, opening them up for applications in heterogeneous integrated electronics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Tao Liu', ',\xa0Leiqiang Chu', ',\xa0Jens Martin', ',\xa0Goki Eda', '\xa0&\xa0Slaven Garaj']}, {'address': 'Centre for Advanced 2D Materials, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Song Liu', ',\xa0Hennrik Schmidt', ',\xa0Jens Martin', ',\xa0Goki Eda', '\xa0&\xa0Slaven Garaj']}, {'address': 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Nanomedicine, State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China', 'authors': ['Song Liu']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Kun-Hua Tu', '\xa0&\xa0Caroline A.

letter,Achromatic metalens array for full-colour light-field imaging,"<p>A light-field camera captures both the intensity and the direction of incoming light. This enables a user to refocus pictures and afterwards reconstruct information on the depth of field. Research on light-field imaging can be divided into two components: acquisition and rendering. Microlens arrays have been used for acquisition, but obtaining broadband achromatic images with no spherical aberration remains challenging. Here, we describe a metalens array made of gallium nitride (GaN) nanoantennas that can be used to capture light-field information and demonstrate a full-colour light-field camera devoid of chromatic aberration. The metalens array contains an array of 60&#8201;&#215;&#8201;60 metalenses with diameters of 21.65&#8201;&#956;m. The camera has a diffraction-limited resolution of 1.95&#8201;&#956;m under white light illumination. The depth of every object in the scene can be reconstructed slice by slice from a series of rendered images with different depths of focus.

article,Vanishing skyrmion Hall effect at the angular momentum compensation temperature of a ferrimagnet,"<p>In the presence of a magnetic field, the flow of charged particles in a conductor is deflected from the direction of the applied force, which gives rise to the ordinary Hall effect. Analogously, moving skyrmions with non-zero topological charges and finite fictitious magnetic fields exhibit the skyrmion Hall effect, which is detrimental for applications such as skyrmion racetrack memory. It was predicted that the skyrmion Hall effect vanishes for antiferromagnetic skyrmions because their fictitious magnetic field, proportional to net spin density, is zero. Here we investigate the current-driven transverse elongation of pinned ferrimagnetic bubbles. We estimate the skyrmion Hall effect from the angle between the current and the bubble elongation directions. The angle and, hence, the skyrmion Hall effect vanishes at the angular momentum compensation temperature where the net spin density vanishes. Furthermore, our study establishes a direct connection between the fictitious magnetic field and the spin density.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan', 'authors': ['Yuushou Hirata', ',\xa0Duck-Ho Kim', ',\xa0Tomoe Nishimura', ',\xa0Takaya Okuno', ',\xa0Yoichi Shiota', ',\xa0Takahiro Moriyama', '\xa0&\xa0Teruo Ono']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California Los Angeles, California, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Se Kwon Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Yaroslav Tserkovnyak']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA', 'authors': ['Se Kwon Kim']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Dong-Kyu Lee', '\xa0&\xa0Kyung-Jin Lee']}, {'address': 'Department of Nano-Semiconductor and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Se-Hyeok Oh', '\xa0&\xa0Kyung-Jin Lee']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Institute of Applied Physics, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Dae-Yun Kim', '\xa0&\xa0Sug-Bong Choe']}, {'address': 'College of Science and Technology, Nihon University, Funabashi, Japan', 'authors': ['Yasuhiro Futakawa', ',\xa0Hiroki Yoshikawa', '\xa0&\xa0Arata Tsukamoto']}, {'address': 'KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Kyung-Jin Lee']}, {'address': 'Center for Spintronics Research Network (CSRN), Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan', 'authors': ['Teruo Ono']}]",False,"['Yuushou Hirata', 'Duck-Ho Kim', 'Se Kwon Kim', 'Dong-Kyu Lee', 'Se-Hyeok Oh', 'Dae-Yun Kim', 'Tomoe Nishimura', 'Takaya Okuno', 'Yasuhiro Futakawa', 'Hiroki Yoshikawa', 'Arata Tsukamoto', 'Yaroslav Tserkovnyak', 'Yoichi Shiota', 'Takahiro Moriyama', 'Sug-Bong Choe', 'Kyung-Jin Lee', 'Teruo Ono']","Hirata, Y., Kim, D., Kim, S.K. et al.

article,Pushing the limits of optical information storage using deep learning,"<p>Diffraction drastically limits the bit density in optical data storage. To increase the storage density, alternative strategies involving supplementary recording dimensions and robust readout schemes must be explored. Here, we propose to encode multiple bits of information in the geometry of subwavelength dielectric nanostructures. A crucial problem in high-density information storage concepts is the robustness of the information readout with respect to fabrication errors and experimental noise. Using a machine-learning-based approach in which the scattering spectra are analysed by an artificial neural network, we achieve quasi-error-free readout of sequences of up to 9&#8201;bits, encoded in top-down fabricated silicon nanostructures. We demonstrate that probing few wavelengths instead of the entire spectrum is sufficient for robust information retrieval and that the readout can be further simplified, exploiting the RGB values from microscopy images.

article,Unravelling inherent electrocatalysis of mixed-conducting oxide activated by metal nanoparticle for fuel cell electrodes,"<p>Highly active metal nanoparticles are desired to serve in high-temperature electrocatalysis, for example, in solid oxide electrochemical cells. Unfortunately, the low thermal stability of nanosized particles and the sophisticated interface requirement for electrode structures to support concurrent ionic and electronic transport make it hard to identify the exact catalytic role of nanoparticles embedded within complex electrode architectures. Here we present an accurate analysis of the reactivity of oxide electrodes boosted by metal nanoparticles, where all particles participate in the reaction. Monodisperse particles (Pt, Pd, Au and Co), 10&#8201;nm in size and stable at high temperature (more than 600&#8201;&#176;C), are uniformly distributed onto mixed-conducting oxide electrodes as a model electrochemical cell via self-assembled nanopatterning. We identify how the metal catalysts activate hydrogen electrooxidation on the ceria-based electrode surface and quantify how rapidly the reaction rate increases with proper choice of metal.

This new technology confines the detection chemistry to a designated organelle, enabling imaging of enzymatic cleavage exclusively within the organelle. We have thus quantitatively mapped disulfide reduction exclusively in endosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans and identified that exchange is mediated by minor populations of the enzymes PDI-3 and TRX-1 resident in endosomes. Impeding intra-endosomal disulfide reduction by knocking down TRX-1 protects nematodes from infection by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, revealing the importance of this minor pool of endosomal TRX-1. TRX-1 also mediates endosomal disulfide reduction in human cells. A range of enzymatic cleavage reactions in organelles are amenable to analysis by this new reporter strategy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Krishna Dan', ',\xa0Aneesh T.

article,Immunoglobulin deposition on biomolecule corona determines complement opsonization efficiency of preclinical and clinical nanoparticles,"<p>Deposition of complement factors (opsonization) on nanoparticles may promote clearance from the blood by macrophages and trigger proinflammatory responses, but the mechanisms regulating the efficiency of complement activation are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that opsonization of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoworms with the third complement protein (C3) was dependent on the biomolecule corona of the nanoparticles. Here we show that natural antibodies play a critical role in C3 opsonization of SPIO nanoworms and a range of clinically approved nanopharmaceuticals. The dependency of C3 opsonization on immunoglobulin binding is almost universal and is observed regardless of the complement activation pathway. Only a few surface-bound immunoglobulin molecules are needed to trigger complement activation and opsonization. Although the total amount of plasma proteins adsorbed on nanoparticles does not determine C3 deposition efficiency, the biomolecule corona per se enhances immunoglobulin binding to all nanoparticle types. We therefore show that natural antibodies represent a link between biomolecule corona and C3 opsonization, and may determine individual complement responses to nanomedicines.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Translational Bio-Nanosciences Laboratory, The Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA', 'authors': ['Vivian P.

article,Endosomolytic polymersomes increase the activity of cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists to enhance cancer immunotherapy,"<p>Cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) agonists of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) are a promising class of immunotherapeutics that activate innate immunity to increase tumour immunogenicity. However, the efficacy of CDNs is limited by drug delivery barriers, including poor cellular targeting, rapid clearance and inefficient transport to the cytosol where STING is localized. Here, we describe STING-activating nanoparticles (STING-NPs)&#8212;rationally designed polymersomes for enhanced cytosolic delivery of the endogenous CDN ligand for STING, 2&#8242;3&#8242; cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP). STING-NPs increase the biological potency of cGAMP, enhance STING signalling in the tumour microenvironment and sentinel lymph node, and convert immunosuppressive tumours to immunogenic, tumoricidal microenvironments. This leads to enhanced therapeutic efficacy of cGAMP, inhibition of tumour growth, increased rates of long-term survival, improved response to immune checkpoint blockade and induction of immunological memory that protects against tumour rechallenge. We validate STING-NPs in freshly isolated human melanoma tissue, highlighting their potential to improve clinical outcomes of immunotherapy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA', 'authors': ['Daniel Shae', ',\xa0Kyle W.

article,Nanoparticles promote in vivo breast cancer cell intravasation and extravasation by inducing endothelial leakiness,"<p>While most cancer nanomedicine is designed to eliminate cancer, the nanomaterial per se can lead to the formation of micrometre-sized gaps in the blood vessel endothelial walls. Nanomaterials-induced endothelial leakiness (NanoEL) might favour intravasation of surviving cancer cells into the surrounding vasculature and subsequently extravasation, accelerating metastasis. Here, we show that nanoparticles induce endothelial leakiness through disruption of the VE-cadherin&#8211;VE-cadherin homophilic interactions at the adherens junction. We show that intravenously injected titanium dioxide, silica and gold nanoparticles significantly accelerate both intravasation and extravasation of breast cancer cells in animal models, increasing the extent of existing metastasis and promoting the appearance of new metastatic sites. Our results add to the understanding of the behaviour of nanoparticles in complex biological systems. The potential for NanoEL needs to be taken into consideration when designing future nanomedicines, especially nanomedicine to treat cancer.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Fei Peng', ',\xa0Magdiel Inggrid Setyawati', ',\xa0Jie Kai Tee', ',\xa0Xianguang Ding', ',\xa0Jinping Wang', '\xa0&\xa0David Tai Leong']}, {'address': 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Fei Peng', ',\xa0Jie Kai Tee', '\xa0&\xa0Han Kiat Ho']}, {'address': 'NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences & Engineering, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Jie Kai Tee', ',\xa0Han Kiat Ho', '\xa0&\xa0David Tai Leong']}, {'address': 'Department of Pathology, National University Hospital and National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Min En Nga']}]",False,"['Fei Peng', 'Magdiel Inggrid Setyawati', 'Jie Kai Tee', 'Xianguang Ding', 'Jinping Wang', 'Min En Nga', 'Han Kiat Ho', 'David Tai Leong']","Peng, F., Setyawati, M.I., Tee, J.K. et al.

article,Self-assembled peptide–poloxamine nanoparticles enable in vitro and in vivo genome restoration for cystic fibrosis,"<p>Developing safe and efficient non-viral delivery systems remains a major challenge for in vivo applications of gene therapy, especially in cystic fibrosis. Unlike conventional cationic polymers or lipids, the emerging poloxamine-based copolymers display promising in vivo gene delivery capabilities. However, poloxamines are invalid for in vitro applications and their in vivo transfection efficiency is still low compared with viral vectors. Here, we show that peptides developed by modular design approaches can spontaneously form compact and monodisperse nanoparticles with poloxamines and nucleic acids via self-assembly. Both messenger RNA and plasmid DNA expression mediated by peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles are greatly boosted in vitro and in the lungs of cystic fibrosis mice with negligible toxicity. Peptide&#8211;poloxamine nanoparticles containing integrating vectors enable successful in vitro and in vivo long-term restoration of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency with a safe integration profile.
