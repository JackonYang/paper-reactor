article,Graphene acoustic plasmon resonator for ultrasensitive infrared spectroscopy,"<p>One of the fundamental hurdles in plasmonics is the trade-off between electromagnetic field confinement and the coupling efficiency with free-space light, a consequence of the large momentum mismatch between the excitation source and plasmonic modes. Acoustic plasmons in graphene, in particular, have an extreme level of field confinement, as well as an extreme momentum mismatch. Here, we show that this fundamental compromise can be overcome and demonstrate a graphene acoustic plasmon resonator with nearly perfect absorption (94%) of incident mid-infrared light. This high efficiency is achieved by utilizing a two-stage coupling scheme: free-space light coupled to conventional graphene plasmons, which then couple to ultraconfined acoustic plasmons. To realize this scheme, we transfer unpatterned large-area graphene onto template-stripped ultraflat metal ribbons. A monolithically integrated optical spacer and a reflector further boost the enhancement. We show that graphene acoustic plasmons allow ultrasensitive measurements of absorption bands and surface phonon modes in &#229;ngstr&#246;m-thick protein and SiO<sub>2</sub> layers, respectively. Our acoustic plasmon resonator platform is scalable and can harness the ultimate level of light&#8211;matter interactions for potential applications including spectroscopy, sensing, metasurfaces and optoelectronics.</p>",[],False,"[""In-Ho Lee"", ""Daehan Yoo"", ""Phaedon Avouris"", ""Tony Low"", ""Sang-Hyun Oh""]","Lee, IH., Yoo, D., Avouris, P. et al.

article,Self-assembly of nanostructured glass metasurfaces via templated fluid instabilities,"<p>Modern devices require the tuning of the size, shape and spatial arrangement of nano-objects and their assemblies with nanometre-scale precision, over large-area and sometimes soft substrates. Such stringent requirements are beyond the reach of conventional lithographic techniques or self-assembly approaches. Here, we show nanoscale control over the fluid instabilities of optical thin glass films for the fabrication of self-assembled all-dielectric optical metasurfaces. We show and model the tailoring of the position, shape and size of nano-objects with feature sizes below 100&#8201;nm and with interparticle distances down to 10&#8201;nm. This approach can generate optical nanostructures over rigid and soft substrates that are more than tens of centimetres in size, with optical performance and resolution on a par with advanced traditional lithography-based processes. To underline the potential of our approach, which reconciles high-performance optical metasurfaces and simple self-assembly fabrication approaches, we demonstrate experimentally and via numerical simulation sharp Fano resonances with a quality factor, Q, as high as &#8764;300 in the visible for all-dielectric nanostructures, to realize protein monolayer detection.</p>",[],False,"[""Tapajyoti Das Gupta"", ""Louis Martin-Monier"", ""Wei Yan"", ""Arthur Le Bris"", ""T\u00f9ng Nguyen-Dang"", ""Alexis G\u00e9rald Page"", ""Kuan-Ting Ho"", ""Filiz Yesilk\u00f6y"", ""Hatice Altug"", ""Yunpeng Qu"", ""Fabien Sorin""]","Das Gupta, T., Martin-Monier, L., Yan, W. et al.

article,Emission and propagation of 1D and 2D spin waves with nanoscale wavelengths in anisotropic spin textures,"<p>Spin waves offer intriguing perspectives for computing and signal processing, because their damping can be lower than the ohmic losses in conventional complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. Magnetic domain walls show considerable potential as magnonic waveguides for on-chip control of the spatial extent and propagation of spin waves. However, low-loss guidance of spin waves with nanoscale wavelengths and around angled tracks remains to be shown. Here, we demonstrate spin wave control using natural anisotropic features of magnetic order in an interlayer exchange-coupled ferromagnetic bilayer. We employ scanning transmission X-ray microscopy to image the generation of spin waves and their propagation across distances exceeding multiples of the wavelength. Spin waves propagate in extended planar geometries as well as along straight or curved one-dimensional domain walls. We observe wavelengths between 1&#8201;&#956;m and 150&#8201;nm, with excitation frequencies ranging from 250&#8201;MHz to 3&#8201;GHz.

A key challenge in this field is obtaining strong coupling between motion and electromagnetic fields without adding additional decoherence. Here we present an electromechanical transducer that integrates a high-frequency (0.42&#8201;GHz) hypersonic phononic crystal with a superconducting microwave circuit. The use of a phononic bandgap crystal enables quantum-level transduction of hypersonic mechanical motion and concurrently eliminates decoherence caused by acoustic radiation.

We observe a magnetotransport regime that is distinctly different from the characteristic Landau fan of graphene, with a sizeable bandgap that can be tuned by a magnetic field.

Developing CO-resistant hydrogenation catalysts with both high activity and selectivity is of great economic interest for industry as it allows the use of cheap crude hydrogen and avoids costly product separation.

The Pt<sub>1</sub>/&#945;-MoC catalyst shows promising activity in the presence of 5,000&#8201;ppm CO, and has a strong chemospecificity towards the hydrogenation of nitro groups. With the assistance of water, high hydrogenation activity can also be achieved using CO and water as a hydrogen source, without sacrificing selectivity and stability.

However, process studies could greatly aid in defining key parameters for nanoplastic interactions within and transfers between technical and environmental compartments. Here we provide a method to synthesize nanoplastic particles doped with a chemically entrapped metal used as a tracer, which provides a robust way to detect nanoplastics more easily, accurately and quantitatively in complex media. We show the utility of this approach in batch studies that simulate the activated sludge process of a municipal waste water treatment plant and so better understand the fate of nanoplastics in urban environments. We found that the majority of particles were associated with the sludge (&gt;98%), with an average recovery of over 93% of the spiked material achieved.

Here, we report a mitochondrial oxidative stress amplifier, MitoCAT-g, which consists of carbon-dot-supported atomically dispersed gold (CAT-g) with further surface modifications of triphenylphosphine and cinnamaldehyde. We find that the MitoCAT-g particles specifically target mitochondria and deplete mitochondrial glutathione with atomic economy, thus amplifying the reactive oxygen species damage caused by cinnamaldehyde and finally leading to apoptosis in cancer cells. We show that imaging-guided interventional injection of these particles potently inhibits tumour growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic patient-derived xenograft hepatocellular carcinoma models without adverse effects.

Both the loss of TP53 and the lack of targeted therapy are significantly correlated with poor clinical outcomes, making TNBC the only type of breast cancer that has no approved targeted therapies. Through in silico analysis, we identified POLR2A in the TP53-neighbouring region as a collateral vulnerability target in TNBC tumours, suggesting that its inhibition via small interfering RNA (siRNA) may be an amenable approach for TNBC targeted treatment. To enhance bioavailability and improve endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA, we designed pH-activated nanoparticles for augmented cytosolic delivery of POLR2A siRNA (siPol2). Suppression of POLR2A expression with the siPol2-laden nanoparticles leads to enhanced growth reduction of tumours characterized by hemizygous POLR2A loss. These results demonstrate the potential of the pH-responsive nanoparticle and the precise POLR2A targeted therapy in TNBC harbouring the common TP53 genomic alteration.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiangsheng Xu"", ""Yunhua Liu"", ""Yujing Li"", ""Hai Wang"", ""Samantha Stewart"", ""Kevin Van der Jeught"", ""Pranay Agarwal"", ""Yuntian Zhang"", ""Sheng Liu"", ""Gang Zhao"", ""Jun Wan"", ""Xiongbin Lu"", ""Xiaoming He""]","Xu, J., Liu, Y., Li, Y. et al.
