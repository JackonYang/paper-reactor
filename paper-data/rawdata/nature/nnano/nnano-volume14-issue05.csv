Such 2D materials currently cover a vast range of properties. Until recently, this family has been missing one crucial member: 2D magnets. The situation has changed over the past 2 years with the introduction of a variety of atomically thin magnetic crystals. Here we will discuss the difference between magnetic states in 2D materials and in bulk crystals and present an overview of the 2D magnets that have been explored recently. We will focus on the case of the two most studied systems&#8212;semiconducting CrI<sub>3</sub> and metallic Fe<sub>3</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub>&#8212;and illustrate the physical phenomena that have been observed.

letter,Bright sub-20-nm cathodoluminescent nanoprobes for electron microscopy,"<p>Electron microscopy has been instrumental in our understanding of complex biological systems. Although electron microscopy reveals cellular morphology with nanoscale resolution, it does not provide information on the location of different types of proteins. An electron-microscopy-based bioimaging technology capable of localizing individual proteins and resolving protein&#8211;protein interactions with respect to cellular ultrastructure would provide important insights into the molecular biology of a cell. Here, we synthesize small lanthanide-doped nanoparticles and measure the absolute photon emission rate of individual nanoparticles resulting from a given electron excitation flux (cathodoluminescence). Our results suggest that the optimization of nanoparticle composition, synthesis protocols and electron imaging conditions can lead to sub-20-nm nanolabels that would enable high signal-to-noise localization of individual biomolecules within a cellular context. In ensemble measurements, these labels exhibit narrow spectra of nine distinct colours, so the imaging of biomolecules in a multicolour electron microscopy modality may be possible.</p>",[],False,"[""Maxim B.

letter,Optical initialization of a single spin-valley in charged WSe2 quantum dots,"<p>Control and manipulation of single charges and their internal degrees of freedom, such as spin, may enable applications in quantum information technology, spintronics and quantum sensing. Recently, atomically thin semiconductors with a direct bandgap such as group VI-B transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers have emerged as a platform for valleytronics&#8212;the study of the valley degree of freedom of charge carriers to store and control information. They offer optical, magnetic and electrical control of the valley index, which, with the spin, is locked into a robust spin-valley index. However, because recombination lifetimes of photogenerated excitations in transition-metal dichalcogenides are of the order of a few picoseconds, optically generated valley excitons possess similar lifetimes. On the other hand, the valley polarization of free holes has a lifetime of microseconds. Whereas progress has been made in optical control of the valley index in ensembles of charge carriers, valley control of individual charges, which is crucial for valleytronics, remains unexplored. Here we provide unambiguous evidence for localized holes with a net spin in optically active WSe<sub>2</sub> quantum dots and we initialize their spin-valley state with the helicity of the excitation laser under small magnetic fields. Under such conditions, we estimate a lower bound of the valley lifetime of a single charge in a quantum dot from the recombination time to be of the order of nanoseconds. Remarkably, neutral quantum dots do not exhibit such spin-valley initialization, which illustrates the role of the excess charge in prolonging the valley lifetime. Our work extends the field of two-dimensional valleytronics to the level of single spin- valleys, with implications for quantum information and sensing applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Xin Lu"", ""Xiaotong Chen"", ""Sudipta Dubey"", ""Qiang Yao"", ""Weijie Li"", ""Xingzhi Wang"", ""Qihua Xiong"", ""Ajit Srivastava""]","Lu, X., Chen, X., Dubey, S. et al.

letter,Spin-polarized electrons in monolayer MoS2,"<p>Coulomb interactions are crucial in determining the ground state of an ideal two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the limit of low electron densities. In this regime, Coulomb interactions dominate over single-particle phase-space filling. In silicon and gallium arsenide, electrons are typically localized at these low densities. In contrast, in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), Coulomb correlations in a 2DEG can be anticipated at experimentally relevant electron densities. Here, we investigate a 2DEG in a gated monolayer of the TMD molybdenum disulfide. We measure the optical susceptibility, a probe of the 2DEG which is local, minimally invasive and spin selective. In a magnetic field of 9.0&#8201;T and at electron concentrations up to n&#8201;&#8771;&#8201;5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>12</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, we present evidence that the ground state is spin-polarized. Out of the four available conduction bands, only two are occupied. These two bands have the same spin but different valley quantum numbers. Our results suggest that only two bands are occupied even in the absence of a magnetic field. The spin polarization increases with decreasing 2DEG density, suggesting that Coulomb interactions are a key aspect of the symmetry breaking. We propose that exchange couplings align the spins. The Bohr radius is so small that even electrons located far apart in phase-space interact with each other.</p>",[],False,"[""Jonas Ga\u00ebl Roch"", ""Guillaume Froehlicher"", ""Nadine Leisgang"", ""Peter Makk"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Richard John Warburton""]","Roch, J.G., Froehlicher, G., Leisgang, N. et al.

letter,Gate-based single-shot readout of spins in silicon,"<p>Electron spins in silicon quantum dots provide a promising route towards realizing the large number of coupled qubits required for a useful quantum processor. For the implementation of quantum algorithms and error detection, qubit measurements are ideally performed in a single shot, which is presently achieved using on-chip charge sensors, capacitively coupled to the quantum dots. However, as the number of qubits is increased, this approach becomes impractical due to the footprint and complexity of the charge sensors, combined with the required proximity to the quantum dots. Alternatively, the spin state can be measured directly by detecting the complex impedance of spin-dependent electron tunnelling between quantum dots. This can be achieved using radiofrequency reflectometry on a single gate electrode defining the quantum dot itself, significantly reducing the gate count and architectural complexity, but thus far it has not been possible to achieve single-shot spin readout using this technique. Here, we detect single electron tunnelling in a double quantum dot and demonstrate that gate-based sensing can be used to read out the electron spin state in a single shot, with an average readout fidelity of 73%. The result demonstrates a key step towards the readout of many spin qubits in parallel, using a compact gate design that will be needed for a large-scale semiconductor quantum processor.</p>",[],False,"[""Anderson West"", ""Bas Hensen"", ""Alexis Jouan"", ""Tuomo Tanttu"", ""Chih-Hwan Yang"", ""Alessandro Rossi"", ""M.

letter,Coulomb blockade in an atomically thin quantum dot coupled to a tunable Fermi reservoir,"<p>Gate-tunable quantum-mechanical tunnelling of particles between a quantum confined state and a nearby Fermi reservoir of delocalized states has underpinned many advances in spintronics and solid-state quantum optics. The prototypical example is a semiconductor quantum dot separated from a gated contact by a tunnel barrier. This enables Coulomb blockade, the phenomenon whereby electrons or holes can be loaded one-by-one into a quantum dot. Depending on the tunnel-coupling strength, this capability facilitates single spin quantum bits or coherent many-body interactions between the confined spin and the Fermi reservoir. Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, in which a wide range of unique atomic layers can easily be combined, offer novel prospects to engineer coherent quantum confined spins, tunnel barriers down to the atomic limit or a Fermi reservoir beyond the conventional flat density of states. However, gate-control of vdW nanostructures at the single particle level is needed to unlock their potential. Here we report Coulomb blockade in a vdW heterostructure consisting of a transition metal dichalcogenide quantum dot coupled to a graphene contact through an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel barrier. Thanks to a tunable Fermi reservoir, we can deterministically load either a single electron or a single hole into the quantum dot. We observe hybrid excitons, composed of localized quantum dot states and delocalized continuum states, arising from ultra-strong spin-conserving tunnel coupling through the atomically thin tunnel barrier. Probing the charged excitons in applied magnetic fields, we observe large gyromagnetic ratios (&#8764;8). Our results establish a foundation for engineering next-generation devices to investigate either novel regimes of Kondo physics or isolated quantum bits in a vdW heterostructure platform.</p>",[],False,"[""Mauro Brotons-Gisbert"", ""Artur Branny"", ""Santosh Kumar"", ""Rapha\u00ebl Picard"", ""Rapha\u00ebl Proux"", ""Mason Gray"", ""Kenneth S.

However, conventional genetic engineering techniques target the nuclear genome, prompting concerns about the proliferation of foreign genes to weedy relatives. Chloroplast transformation does not have this limitation, since the plastid genome is maternally inherited in most plants, motivating the need for organelle-specific and selective nanocarriers. Here, we rationally designed chitosan-complexed single-walled carbon nanotubes, utilizing the lipid exchange envelope penetration mechanism. The single-walled carbon nanotubes selectively deliver plasmid DNA to chloroplasts of different plant species without external biolistic or chemical aid. We demonstrate chloroplast-targeted transgene delivery and transient expression in mature Eruca&#8201;sativa, Nasturtium&#8201;officinale, Nicotiana&#8201;tabacum and Spinacia&#8201;oleracea plants and in isolated Arabidopsis&#8201;thaliana mesophyll protoplasts.

The plant cell wall is a barrier that limits the ease and throughput of exogenous biomolecule delivery to plants. Current delivery methods either suffer from host-range limitations, low transformation efficiencies, tissue damage or unavoidable DNA integration into the host genome. Here, we demonstrate efficient diffusion-based biomolecule delivery into intact plants of several species with pristine and chemically functionalized high aspect ratio nanomaterials. Efficient DNA delivery and strong protein expression without transgene integration is accomplished in Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb), Eruca sativa (arugula), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Gossypium hirsutum (cotton) leaves and arugula protoplasts.

article,Miniature gold nanorods for photoacoustic molecular imaging in the second near-infrared optical window,"<p>In photoacoustic imaging, the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window is where tissue generates the least background signal. However, the large size of the few available contrast agents in this spectral range impedes their pharmacokinetics and decreases their thermal stability, leading to unreliable photoacoustic imaging. Here, we report the synthesis of miniaturized gold nanorods absorbing in the NIR-II that are 5&#8211;11 times smaller than regular-sized gold nanorods with a similar aspect ratio. Under nanosecond pulsed laser illumination, small nanorods are about 3&#8201;times more thermally stable and generate 3.5&#8201;times stronger photoacoustic signal than their absorption-matched larger counterparts. These unexpected findings are confirmed using theoretical and numerical analysis, showing that photoacoustic signal is not only proportional to the optical absorption of the nanoparticle solution but also to the surface-to-volume ratio of the nanoparticles. In living tumour-bearing mice, these small targeted nanorods display a 30% improvement in efficiency of agent delivery to tumours and generate 4.5&#8201;times greater photoacoustic contrast.</p>",[],False,"[""Yun-Sheng Chen"", ""Yang Zhao"", ""Soon Joon Yoon"", ""Sanjiv Sam Gambhir"", ""Stanislav Emelianov""]","Chen, YS., Zhao, Y., Yoon, S.J. et al.

article,Tapered InP nanowire arrays for efficient broadband high-speed single-photon detection,"<p>Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with peak efficiencies above 90% and unrivalled timing jitter (&lt;30&#8201;ps) have emerged as a potent technology for quantum information and sensing applications. However, their high cost and cryogenic operation limit their widespread applicability. Here, we present an approach using tapered InP nanowire p&#8211;n junction arrays for high-efficiency, broadband and high-speed photodetection without the need for cryogenic cooling. The truncated conical nanowire shape enables a broadband, linear photoresponse in the ultraviolet to near-infrared range (~500&#8201;nm bandwidth) with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 85%. The devices exhibit a high gain beyond 10<sup>5</sup>, such that a single photon per pulse can be distinguished from the dark noise, while simultaneously showing a fast pulse rise time (&lt;1&#8201;ns) and excellent timing jitter (&lt;20&#8201;ps). Such detectors open up new possibilities for applications in remote sensing, dose monitoring for cancer treatment, three-dimensional imaging and quantum communication.</p>",[],False,"[""Sandra J.

article,Simultaneous voltage and current density imaging of flowing electrons in two dimensions,"<p>A variety of physical phenomena associated with nanoscale electron transport often results in non-trivial spatial voltage and current patterns, particularly in nonlocal transport regimes. While numerous techniques have been devised to image electron flows, the need remains for a nanoscale probe capable of simultaneously imaging current and voltage distributions with high sensitivity and minimal invasiveness, in a magnetic field, across a broad range of temperatures and beneath an insulating surface. Here we present a technique for spatially mapping electron flows based on a nanotube single-electron transistor, which achieves high sensitivity for both voltage and current imaging. In a series of experiments using high-mobility graphene devices, we demonstrate the ability of our technique to visualize local aspects of intrinsically nonlocal transport, as in ballistic flows, which are not easily resolvable via existing methods. This technique should aid in understanding the physics of two-dimensional electronic devices and enable new classes of experiments that image electron flow through buried nanostructures in the quantum and interaction-dominated regimes.</p>",[],False,"[""Lior Ella"", ""Asaf Rozen"", ""John Birkbeck"", ""Moshe Ben-Shalom"", ""David Perello"", ""Johanna Zultak"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Andre K.

article,Unidirectional rotary motion in a metal–organic framework,"<p>Overcrowded alkene-based light-driven molecular motors are able to perform large-amplitude repetitive unidirectional rotations. Their behaviour is well understood in solution. However, Brownian motion precludes the precise positioning at the nanoscale needed to harness cooperative action. Here, we demonstrate molecular motors organized in crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The motor unit becomes a part of the organic linker (or strut), and its spatial arrangement is elucidated through powder and single-crystal X-ray analyses and polarized optical and Raman microscopies. We confirm that the light-driven unidirectional rotation of the motor units is retained in the MOF framework and that the motors can operate in the solid state with similar rotary speed (rate of thermal helix inversion) to that in solution. These &#8216;moto-MOFs&#8217; could in the future be used to control dynamic function in crystalline materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Wojciech Danowski"", ""Thomas van Leeuwen"", ""Shaghayegh Abdolahzadeh"", ""Diederik Roke"", ""Wesley R.
