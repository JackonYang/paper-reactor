review article,Nano-enabled strategies to enhance crop nutrition and protection,"<p>Various nano-enabled strategies are proposed to improve crop production and meet the growing global demands for food, feed and fuel while practising sustainable agriculture. After providing a brief overview of the challenges faced in the sector of crop nutrition and protection, this Review presents the possible applications of nanotechnology in this area. We also consider performance data from patents and unpublished sources so as to define the scope of what can be realistically achieved. In addition to being an industry with a narrow profit margin, agricultural businesses have inherent constraints that must be carefully considered and that include existing (or future) regulations, as well as public perception and acceptance.

review article,Nanobiotechnology approaches for engineering smart plant sensors,"<p>Nanobiotechnology has the potential to enable smart plant sensors that communicate with and actuate electronic devices for improving plant productivity, optimize and automate water and agrochemical allocation, and enable high-throughput plant chemical phenotyping. Reducing crop loss due to environmental and pathogen-related stresses, improving resource use efficiency and selecting optimal plant traits are major challenges in plant agriculture industries worldwide. New technologies are required to accurately monitor, in real time and with high spatial and temporal resolution, plant physiological and developmental responses to their microenvironment. Nanomaterials are allowing the translation of plant chemical signals into digital information that can be monitored by standoff electronic devices. Herein, we discuss the design and interfacing of smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors that report plant signalling molecules associated with health status to agricultural and phenotyping devices via optical, wireless or electrical signals. We describe how nanomaterial-mediated delivery of genetically encoded sensors can act as tools for research and development of smart plant sensors. We assess performance parameters of smart nanobiotechnology-based sensors in plants (for example, resolution, sensitivity, accuracy and durability) including in vivo optical nanosensors and wearable nanoelectronic sensors. To conclude, we present an integrated and prospective vision on how nanotechnology could enable smart plant sensors that communicate with and actuate electronic devices for monitoring and optimizing individual plant productivity and resource use.</p>",[],False,"[""Juan Pablo Giraldo"", ""Honghong Wu"", ""Gregory Michael Newkirk"", ""Sebastian Kruss""]","Giraldo, J.P., Wu, H., Newkirk, G.M. et al.

letter,Quantum non-demolition measurement of an electron spin qubit,"<p>Measurements of quantum systems inevitably involve disturbance in various forms. Within the limits imposed by quantum mechanics, there exists an ideal projective measurement that does not introduce a back action on the measured observable, known as a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical QND measurement of a single electron spin in a gate-defined quantum dot. We entangle the single spin with a two-electron, singlet&#8211;triplet ancilla qubit via the exchange interaction and then read out the ancilla in a single shot. This procedure realizes a disturbance-free projective measurement of the single spin at a rate two orders of magnitude faster than its relaxation. The QND nature of the measurement protocol enables enhancement of the overall measurement fidelity by repeating the protocol. We demonstrate a monotonic increase of the fidelity over 100 repetitions against arbitrary input states. Our analysis based on statistical inference is tolerant to the presence of the relaxation and dephasing. We further exemplify the QND character of the measurement by observing spontaneous flips (quantum jumps) of a single electron spin. Combined with the high-fidelity control of spin qubits, these results will allow for various measurement-based quantum state manipulations including quantum error correction protocols.</p>",[],False,"[""Takashi Nakajima"", ""Akito Noiri"", ""Jun Yoneda"", ""Matthieu R.

letter,Interface-driven chiral magnetism and current-driven domain walls in insulating magnetic garnets,"<p>Magnetic oxides exhibit rich fundamental physics and technologically desirable properties for spin-based memory, logic and signal transmission. Recently, spin&#8211;orbit-induced spin transport phenomena have been realized in insulating magnetic oxides by using proximate heavy metal layers such as platinum. In their metallic ferromagnet counterparts, such interfaces also give rise to a Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction that can stabilize homochiral domain walls and skyrmions with efficient current-driven dynamics. However, chiral magnetism in centrosymmetric oxides has not yet been observed. Here we discover chiral magnetism that allows for pure spin-current-driven domain wall motion in the most ubiquitous class of magnetic oxides, ferrimagnetic iron garnets. We show that epitaxial rare-earth iron garnet films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy exhibit homochiral N&#233;el domain walls that can be propelled faster than 800&#8201;m&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> by spin current from an adjacent platinum layer. We find that, despite the relatively small interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, very high velocities can be attained due to the antiferromagnetic spin dynamics associated with ferrimagnetic order.</p>",[],False,"[""Can Onur Avci"", ""Ethan Rosenberg"", ""Lucas Caretta"", ""Felix B\u00fcttner"", ""Maxwell Mann"", ""Colin Marcus"", ""David Bono"", ""Caroline A.

letter,Probing van der Waals interactions at two-dimensional heterointerfaces,"<p>Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures assembled via van der Waals (vdW) interactions have sparked immense interest in fields from physics to electronics. Understanding the vdW interaction at these heterointerfaces is critical for the sophisticated construction and manipulation of these 2D heterostructures. However, previous experimental research has mainly focused on the interlayer interactions in homogeneous graphite crystals and the interactions between graphene and substrates. Theoretically, although a variety of vdW methods have been incorporated in density functional theory to probe the interactions of homogeneous vdW crystals, the reliability of these vdW methods in 2D heterostructures remains to be verified. Here, we show, by contact-splitting transfer of graphite from hexagonal boron nitride (BN) to molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>), that graphite experiences a stronger vdW interaction with MoS<sub>2</sub> than with boron nitride. Quantitative measurements using a graphite-wrapped atomic force microscope tip show that the critical adhesion pressures between BN and graphite and MoS<sub>2</sub> and graphite are respectively 0.953 and 1.028 times that between graphite and graphite. The results are consistent with the prediction based on Lifshitz theory, implying an important role of material dielectric function in the vdW interactions at heterointerfaces. These findings offer us more freedom in the construction of 2D heterostructures, and a technique to disassemble 2D heterostructures is demonstrated.</p>",[],False,"[""Baowen Li"", ""Jun Yin"", ""Xiaofei Liu"", ""Hongrong Wu"", ""Jidong Li"", ""Xuemei Li"", ""Wanlin Guo""]","Li, B., Yin, J., Liu, X. et al.

article,Ionic Coulomb blockade as a fractional Wien effect,"<p>Recent advances in nanofluidics have allowed the exploration of ion transport down to molecular-scale confinement, yet artificial porins are still far from reaching the advanced functionalities of biological ion machinery. Achieving single ion transport that is tunable by an external gate&#8212;the ionic analogue of electronic Coulomb blockade&#8212;would open new avenues in this quest. However, an understanding of ionic Coulomb blockade beyond the electronic analogy is still lacking. Here, we show that the many-body dynamics of ions in a charged nanochannel result in quantized and strongly nonlinear ionic transport, in full agreement with molecular simulations. We find that ionic Coulomb blockade occurs when, upon sufficient confinement, oppositely charged ions form &#8216;Bjerrum pairs&#8217;, and the conduction proceeds through a mechanism reminiscent of Onsager&#8217;s Wien effect.

article,A solid-state source of strongly entangled photon pairs with high brightness and indistinguishability,"<p>The generation of high-quality entangled photon pairs has been a long-sought goal in modern quantum communication and computation. So far, the most widely used entangled photon pairs have been generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), a process that is intrinsically probabilistic and thus relegated to a regime of low rates of pair generation. In contrast, semiconductor quantum dots can generate triggered entangled photon pairs through a cascaded radiative decay process and do not suffer from any fundamental trade-off between source brightness and multi-pair generation. However, a source featuring simultaneously high photon extraction efficiency, high degree of entanglement fidelity and photon indistinguishability has been lacking. Here, we present an entangled photon pair source with high brightness and indistinguishability by deterministically embedding GaAs quantum dots in broadband photonic nanostructures that enable Purcell-enhanced emission. Our source produces entangled photon pairs with a pair collection probability of up to 0.65(4) (single-photon extraction efficiency of 0.85(3)), entanglement fidelity of 0.88(2), and indistinguishabilities of 0.901(3) and 0.903(3) (brackets indicate uncertainty on last digit).

article,Injection of oxygen vacancies in the bulk lattice of layered cathodes,"<p>Surfaces, interfaces and grain boundaries are classically known to be sinks of defects generated within the bulk lattice. Here, we report an inverse case by which the defects generated at the particle surface are continuously pumped into the bulk lattice. We show that, during operation of a rechargeable battery, oxygen vacancies produced at the surfaces of lithium-rich layered cathode particles migrate towards the inside lattice. This process is associated with a high cutoff voltage at which an anionic redox process is activated. First-principle calculations reveal that triggering of this redox process leads to a sharp decrease of both the formation energy of oxygen vacancies and the migration barrier of oxidized oxide ions, therefore enabling the migration of oxygen vacancies into the bulk lattice of the cathode. This work unveils a coupled redox dynamic that needs to be taken into account when designing high-capacity layered cathode materials for high-voltage lithium-ion batteries.</p>",[],False,"[""Pengfei Yan"", ""Jianming Zheng"", ""Zhen-Kun Tang"", ""Arun Devaraj"", ""Guoying Chen"", ""Khalil Amine"", ""Ji-Guang Zhang"", ""Li-Min Liu"", ""Chongmin Wang""]","Yan, P., Zheng, J., Tang, ZK. et al.

article,Soft biomimetic nanoconfinement promotes amorphous water over ice,"<p>Water is a ubiquitous liquid with unique physicochemical properties, whose nature has shaped our planet and life as we know it. Water in restricted geometries has different properties than in bulk. Confinement can prevent low-temperature crystallization of the molecules into a hexagonal structure and thus create a state of amorphous water. To understand the survival of life at subzero temperatures, it is essential to elucidate this behaviour in the presence of nanoconfining lipidic membranes. Here we introduce a family of synthetic lipids with designed cyclopropyl modifications in the hydrophobic chains that exhibit unique liquid-crystalline behaviour at low temperature, which enables the maintenance of amorphous water down to ~10&#8201;K due to nanoconfinement. The combination of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations unveils a complex lipid&#8211;water phase diagram in which bicontinuous cubic and lamellar liquid crystalline phases that contain subzero liquid, glassy or ice water emerge as a competition between the two components, each pushing towards its thermodynamically favoured state.</p>",[],False,"[""Livia Salvati Manni"", ""Salvatore Assenza"", ""Michael Duss"", ""Jijo J.

article,FDA-approved ferumoxytol displays anti-leukaemia efficacy against cells with low ferroportin levels,"<p>Acute myeloid leukaemia is a fatal disease for most patients. We have found that ferumoxytol (Feraheme), an FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticle for iron deficiency treatment, demonstrates an anti-leukaemia effect in vitro and in vivo. Using leukaemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukaemia patient samples, we show that low expression of the iron exporter ferroportin results in a susceptibility of these cells via an increase in intracellular iron from ferumoxytol. The reactive oxygen species produced by free ferrous iron lead to increased oxidative stress and cell death. Ferumoxytol treatment results in a significant reduction of disease burden in a murine leukaemia model and patient-derived xenotransplants bearing leukaemia cells with low ferroportin expression. Our findings show how a clinical nanoparticle previously considered largely biologically inert could be rapidly incorporated into clinical trials for patients with leukaemia with low ferroportin levels.</p>",[],False,"[""Vicenta Trujillo-Alonso"", ""Edwin C.
