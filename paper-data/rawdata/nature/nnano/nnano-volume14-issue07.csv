review article,An atlas of nano-enabled neural interfaces,"<p>Advances in microscopy and molecular strategies have allowed researchers to gain insight into the intricate organization of the mammalian brain and the roles that neurons play in processing information. Despite vast progress, therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders remain limited, owing to a lack of biomaterials for sensing and modulating neuronal signalling in vivo. Therefore, there is a pressing need for developing material-based tools that can form seamless biointerfaces and interrogate the brain with unprecedented resolution. In this Review, we discuss important considerations in material design and implementation, highlight recent breakthroughs in neural sensing and modulation, and propose future directions in neurotechnology research. Our goal is to create an atlas for nano-enabled neural interfaces and to demonstrate how emerging nanotechnologies can interrogate neural systems spanning multiple biological length scales.</p>",[],False,"[""H\u00e9ctor Acar\u00f3n Ledesma"", ""Xiaojian Li"", ""Jo\u00e3o L.

letter,Thermal skyrmion diffusion used in a reshuffler device,"<p>Magnetic skyrmions in thin films can be efficiently displaced with high speed by using spin-transfer torques and spin&#8211;orbit torques at low current densities. Although this favourable combination of properties has raised expectations for using skyrmions in devices, only a few publications have studied the thermal effects on the skyrmion dynamics. However, thermally induced skyrmion dynamics can be used for applications such as unconventional computing approaches, as they have been predicted to be useful for probabilistic computing devices. In our work, we uncover thermal diffusive skyrmion dynamics by a combined experimental and numerical study. We probed the dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in a specially tailored low-pinning multilayer material. The observed thermally excited skyrmion motion dominates the dynamics. Analysing the diffusion as a function of temperature, we found an exponential dependence, which we confirmed by means of numerical simulations. The diffusion of skyrmions was further used in a signal reshuffling device as part of a skyrmion-based probabilistic computing architecture. Owing to its inherent two-dimensional texture, the observation of a diffusive motion of skyrmions in thin-film systems may also yield insights in soft-matter-like characteristics (for example, studies of fluctuation theorems, thermally induced roughening and so on), which thus makes it highly desirable to realize and study thermal effects in experimentally accessible skyrmion systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Jakub Z\u00e1zvorka"", ""Florian Jakobs"", ""Daniel Heinze"", ""Niklas Keil"", ""Sascha Kromin"", ""Samridh Jaiswal"", ""Kai Litzius"", ""Gerhard Jakob"", ""Peter Virnau"", ""Daniele Pinna"", ""Karin Everschor-Sitte"", ""Levente R\u00f3zsa"", ""Andreas Donges"", ""Ulrich Nowak"", ""Mathias Kl\u00e4ui""]","Zázvorka, J., Jakobs, F., Heinze, D. et al.

letter,Small footprint transistor architecture for photoswitching logic and in situ memory,"<p>The need for continuous size downscaling of silicon transistors is driving the industrial development of strategies to enable further footprint reduction. The atomic thickness of two-dimensional materials allows the potential realization of high-area-efficiency transistor architectures. However, until now, the design of devices composed of two-dimensional materials has mimicked the basic architecture of silicon circuits. Here, we report a transistor based on a two-dimensional material that can realize photoswitching logic (OR, AND) computing in a single cell. Unlike the conventional transistor working mechanism, the two-dimensional material logic transistor has two surface channels. Furthermore, the material thickness can change the logic behaviour&#8212;the architecture can be flexibly expanded to achieve in situ memory such as logic computing and data storage convergence in the same device. These devices are potentially promising candidates for the construction of new chips that can perform computing and storage with high area-efficiency and unique functions.</p>",[],False,"[""Chunsen Liu"", ""Huawei Chen"", ""Xiang Hou"", ""Heng Zhang"", ""Jun Han"", ""Yu-Gang Jiang"", ""Xiaoyang Zeng"", ""David Wei Zhang"", ""Peng Zhou""]","Liu, C., Chen, H., Hou, X. et al.

letter,Strain-based room-temperature non-volatile MoTe2 ferroelectric phase change transistor,"<p>The primary mechanism of operation of almost all transistors today relies on the electric-field effect in a semiconducting channel to tune its conductivity from the conducting &#8216;on&#8217; state to a non-conducting &#8216;off&#8217; state. As transistors continue to scale down to increase computational performance, physical limitations from nanoscale field-effect operation begin to cause undesirable current leakage, which is detrimental to the continued advancement of computing. Using a fundamentally different mechanism of operation, we show that through nanoscale strain engineering with thin films and ferroelectrics the transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe<sub>2</sub> can be reversibly switched with electric-field-induced strain between the 1T&#8242;-MoTe<sub>2</sub> (semimetallic) phase to a semiconducting MoTe<sub>2</sub> phase in a field-effect transistor geometry. This alternative mechanism for transistor switching sidesteps all the static and dynamic power consumption problems in conventional field-effect transistors. Using strain, we achieve large non-volatile changes in channel conductivity (G<sub>on</sub>/G<sub>off</sub>&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;10<sup>7</sup> versus G<sub>on</sub>/G<sub>off</sub>&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;0.04 in the control device) at room temperature. Ferroelectric devices offer the potential to reach sub-nanosecond non-volatile strain switching at the attojoule/bit level, with immediate applications in ultrafast low-power non-volatile logic and memory while also transforming the landscape of computational architectures because conventional power, speed and volatility considerations for microelectronics may no longer exist.</p>",[],False,"[""Wenhui Hou"", ""Ahmad Azizimanesh"", ""Arfan Sewaket"", ""Tara Pe\u00f1a"", ""Carla Watson"", ""Ming Liu"", ""Hesam Askari"", ""Stephen M.

letter,"Defect induced, layer-modulated magnetism in ultrathin metallic PtSe2","<p>Defects are ubiquitous in solids and often introduce new properties that are absent in pristine materials. One of the opportunities offered by these crystal imperfections is an extrinsically induced long-range magnetic ordering, a long-time subject of theoretical investigations. Intrinsic, two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials are attracting increasing attention for their unique properties, which include layer-dependent magnetism and electric field modulation. Yet, to induce magnetism into otherwise non-magnetic 2D materials remains a challenge. Here we investigate magneto-transport properties of ultrathin PtSe<sub>2</sub> crystals and demonstrate an unexpected magnetism. Our electrical measurements show the existence of either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ground-state orderings that depends on the number of layers in this ultrathin material. The change in the device resistance on the application of a ~25&#8201;mT magnetic field is as high as 400&#8201;&#937; with a magnetoresistance value of 5%. Our first-principles calculations suggest that surface magnetism induced by the presence of Pt vacancies and the Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida (RKKY) exchange couplings across ultrathin films of PtSe<sub>2</sub> are responsible for the observed layer-dependent magnetism. Given the existence of such unavoidable growth-related vacancies in 2D materials, these findings can expand the range of 2D ferromagnets into materials that would otherwise be overlooked.</p>",[],False,"[""Ahmet Avsar"", ""Alberto Ciarrocchi"", ""Michele Pizzochero"", ""Dmitrii Unuchek"", ""Oleg V.

letter,Transition metal dichalcogenide nanodisks as high-index dielectric Mie nanoresonators,"<p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have recently been proposed as an excitonic platform for advanced optical and electronic functionalities. However, in spite of intense research efforts, it has not been widely appreciated that TMDCs also possess a high refractive index. This characteristic opens up the possibility to utilize them to construct resonant nanoantennas based on subwavelength geometrical modes. Here, we show that nanodisks, fabricated from exfoliated multilayer WS<sub>2</sub>, support distinct Mie resonances and anapole states that can be tuned in wavelength over the visible and near-infrared range by varying the nanodisk size and aspect ratio. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a novel regime of light&#8211;matter interaction&#8212;anapole-exciton polaritons&#8212;which we realize within a single WS<sub>2</sub> nanodisk. We argue that the TMDC material anisotropy and the presence of excitons enrich traditional nanophotonics approaches based on conventional high-index materials and/or plasmonics.</p>",[],False,"[""Ruggero Verre"", ""Denis G.

letter,Solution processable liquid metal nanodroplets by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization,"<p>Eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) is a liquid metal alloy at room temperature. EGaIn microdroplets can be incorporated into elastomers to fabricate highly stretchable, mechanically robust, soft multifunctional composites with high thermal stability and electrical conductivity that are suitable for applications in soft robotics and self-healing electronics. However, the current methods of preparation rely on mechanical mixing, which may lead to irregularly shaped micrometre-sized droplets and an anisotropic distribution of properties. Therefore, procedures for the stabilization of sub-micrometre-sized droplets of EGaIn and compatibilization in polymer matrices and solvents have attracted significant attention. Here we report the synthesis of EGaIn nanodroplets stabilized by polymeric ligand encapsulation. We use a surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization initiator to covalently functionalize the oxide layer on the surface of the EGaIn nanodroplets with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBMA), poly(2-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) and poly(n-butyl acrylate-block-methyl methacrylate) (PBA-b-PMMA). These nanodroplets are stable in organic solvents, in water or in polymer matrices up to 50&#8201;wt% concentration, enabling direct solution-casting into flexible hybrid materials. The liquid metal can be recovered from dispersion by acid treatment.

article,"Current-controlled propagation of spin waves in antiparallel, coupled domains","<p>Spin waves may constitute key components of low-power spintronic devices. Antiferromagnetic-type spin waves are innately high-speed, stable and dual-polarized. So far, it has remained challenging to excite and manipulate antiferromagnetic-type propagating spin waves. Here, we investigate spin waves in periodic 100-nm-wide stripe domains with alternating upward and downward magnetization in La<sub>0.67</sub>Sr<sub>0.33</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> thin films. In addition to ordinary low-frequency modes, a high-frequency mode around 10&#8201;GHz is observed and propagates along the stripe domains with a spin-wave dispersion different from the low-frequency mode. Based on a theoretical model that considers two oppositely oriented coupled domains, this high-frequency mode is accounted for as an effective antiferromagnetic spin-wave mode. The spin waves exhibit group velocities of 2.6&#8201;km&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and propagate even at zero magnetic bias field.

They extend over only a few nanometres and depend sensitively on the detuning, dephasing and relative orientation (that is, the vectorial properties) of the coupled dipoles. Here, we introduce plasmonic nanofocusing spectroscopy to record coherent light scattering spectra with 5&#8201;nm spatial resolution from the apex of a conical gold nanotaper. The apex is excited solely by evanescent fields and coupled to plasmon resonances in a single gold nanorod. We resolve resonance energy shifts and line broadenings as a function of dipole distance and relative orientation. We demonstrate how these phenomena arise from mode couplings between different vectorial components of the interacting optical near fields, specifically from the coupling of the nanorod to both transverse and longitudinal polarizabilities of the taper apex.</p>",[],False,"[""Martin Esmann"", ""Simon Fabian Becker"", ""Julia Witt"", ""Jinxin Zhan"", ""Abbas Chimeh"", ""Anke Korte"", ""Jinhui Zhong"", ""Ralf Vogelgesang"", ""Gunther Wittstock"", ""Christoph Lienau""]","Esmann, M., Becker, S.F., Witt, J. et al.

article,"Ultrathin, flexible, solid polymer composite electrolyte enabled with aligned nanoporous host for lithium batteries","<p>The urgent need for safer batteries is leading research to all-solid-state lithium-based cells. To achieve energy density comparable to liquid electrolyte-based cells, ultrathin and lightweight solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity are desired. However, solid electrolytes with comparable thicknesses to commercial polymer electrolyte separators (~10&#8201;&#956;m) used in liquid electrolytes remain challenging to make because of the increased risk of short-circuiting the battery. Here, we report on a polymer&#8211;polymer solid-state electrolyte design, demonstrated with an 8.6-&#956;m-thick nanoporous polyimide (PI) film filled with polyethylene oxide/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LiTFSI) that can be used as a safe solid polymer electrolyte. The PI film is nonflammable and mechanically strong, preventing batteries from short-circuiting even after more than 1,000&#8201;h of cycling, and the vertical channels enhance the ionic conductivity (2.3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>&#8201;S&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 30&#8201;&#176;C) of the infused polymer electrolyte. All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries fabricated with PI/PEO/LiTFSI solid electrolyte show good cycling performance (200 cycles at C/2 rate) at 60&#8201;&#176;C and withstand abuse tests such as bending, cutting and nail penetration.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiayu Wan"", ""Jin Xie"", ""Xian Kong"", ""Zhe Liu"", ""Kai Liu"", ""Feifei Shi"", ""Allen Pei"", ""Hao Chen"", ""Wei Chen"", ""Jun Chen"", ""Xiaokun Zhang"", ""Linqi Zong"", ""Jiangyan Wang"", ""Long-Qing Chen"", ""Jian Qin"", ""Yi Cui""]","Wan, J., Xie, J., Kong, X. et al.

article,Soil mobility of synthetic and virus-based model nanopesticides,"<p>Large doses of chemical pesticides are required to achieve effective concentrations in the rhizosphere, which results in the accumulation of harmful residues. Precision farming is needed to improve the efficacy of pesticides, but also to avoid environmental pollution, and slow-release formulations based on nanoparticles offer one solution. Here, we tested the mobility of synthetic and virus-based model nanopesticides by combining soil column experiments with computational modelling. We found that the tobacco mild green mosaic virus and cowpea mosaic virus penetrate soil to a depth of at least 30&#8201;cm, and could therefore deliver nematicides to the rhizosphere, whereas the Physalis mosaic virus remains in the first 4&#8201;cm of soil and would be more useful for the delivery of herbicides. Our experiments confirm that plant viruses are superior to synthetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) for the delivery and controlled release of pesticides, and could be developed as the next generation of pesticide delivery systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Paul L.

article,Long-term pulmonary exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes promotes breast cancer metastatic cascades,"<p>Anthropogenic carbon nanotubes, with a fibrous structure and physical properties similar to asbestos, have recently been found within human lung tissues. However, the reported carbon-nanotube-elicited pulmonary pathologies have been mostly confined to inflammatory or neoplastic lesions in the lungs or adjacent tissues. In the present study, we demonstrate that a single pulmonary exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes dramatically enhances angiogenesis and the invasiveness of orthotopically implanted mammary carcinoma, leading to metastasis and rapid colonization of the lungs and other organs. Exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes stimulates local and systemic inflammation, contributing to the formation of pre-metastatic and metastatic niches. Our study suggests that nanoscale-material-elicited pulmonary lesions may exert complex and extended influences on tumour progression. Given the increasing presence of carbon nanotubes in the environment, this report emphasizes the urgent need to escalate efforts assessing the long-term risks of airborne nanomaterial exposure in non-lung cancer progression.</p>",[],False,"[""Xuefei Lu"", ""Yong Zhu"", ""Ru Bai"", ""Zhengsheng Wu"", ""Wenchang Qian"", ""Leiyan Yang"", ""Rong Cai"", ""Hong Yan"", ""Tao Li"", ""Vijay Pandey"", ""Ying Liu"", ""Peter E.
