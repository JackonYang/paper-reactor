letter,Gate-based high fidelity spin readout in a CMOS device,"<p>The engineering of a compact qubit unit cell that embeds all quantum functionalities is mandatory for large-scale integration. In addition, these functionalities should present the lowest error rate possible to successfully implement quantum error correction protocols. Electron spins in silicon quantum dots are particularly promising because of their high control fidelity and their potential compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor industrial platforms. However, an efficient and scalable spin readout scheme is still missing. Here we demonstrate a high fidelity and robust spin readout based on gate reflectometry in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor device that consists of a qubit dot and an ancillary dot coupled to an electron reservoir. This scalable method allows us to read out a spin in a single-shot manner with an average fidelity above 98% for a 0.5&#8201;ms integration time. To achieve such a fidelity, we combine radio-frequency gate reflectometry with a latched spin blockade mechanism that requires electron exchange between the ancillary dot and the reservoir. We show that the demonstrated high readout fidelity is fully preserved up to 0.5&#8201;K. This result holds particular relevance for the future cointegration of spin qubits and classical control electronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Matias Urdampilleta"", ""David J.

letter,Rapid gate-based spin read-out in silicon using an on-chip resonator,"<p>Silicon spin qubits are one of the leading platforms for quantum computation. As with any qubit implementation, a crucial requirement is the ability to measure individual quantum states rapidly and with high fidelity. Since the signal from a single electron spin is minute, the different spin states are converted to different charge states. Charge detection, so far, has mostly relied on external electrometers, which hinders scaling to two-dimensional spin qubit arrays. Alternatively, gate-based dispersive read-out based on off-chip lumped element resonators has been demonstrated, but integration times of 0.2&#8211;2&#8201;ms were required to achieve single-shot read-out. Here, we connect an on-chip superconducting resonant circuit to two of the gates that confine electrons in a double quantum dot. Measurement of the power transmitted through a feedline coupled to the resonator probes the charge susceptibility, distinguishing whether or not an electron can oscillate between the dots in response to the probe power. With this approach, we achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of about six within an integration time of only 1&#8201;&#956;s. Using Pauli&#8217;s exclusion principle for spin-to-charge conversion, we demonstrate single-shot read-out of a two-electron spin state with an average fidelity of &gt;98% in 6&#8201;&#956;s. This result may form the basis of frequency-multiplexed read-out in dense spin qubit systems without external electrometers, therefore simplifying the system architecture.</p>",[],False,"[""Guoji Zheng"", ""Nodar Samkharadze"", ""Marc L.

letter,Quantifying error and leakage in an encoded Si/SiGe triple-dot qubit,"<p>Quantum computation requires qubits that satisfy often-conflicting criteria, which include long-lasting coherence and scalable control. One approach to creating a suitable qubit is to operate in an encoded subspace of several physical qubits. Although such encoded qubits may be particularly susceptible to leakage out of their computational subspace, they can be insensitive to certain noise processes and can also allow logical control with a single type of entangling interaction while maintaining favourable features of the underlying physical system. Here we demonstrate high-fidelity operation of an exchange-only qubit encoded in a subsystem of three coupled electron spins confined in gated, isotopically enhanced silicon quantum dots. This encoding requires neither high-frequency electric nor magnetic fields for control, and instead relies exclusively on the exchange interaction, which is highly local and can be modulated with a large on&#8211;off ratio using only fast voltage pulses. It is also compatible with very low and gradient-free magnetic field environments, which simplifies integration with superconducting materials. We developed and employed a modified blind randomized benchmarking protocol that determines both computational and leakage errors, and found that unitary operations have an average total error of 0.35%, with half of that, 0.17%, coming from leakage driven by interactions with substrate nuclear spins. The combination of this proven performance with complete control via gate voltages makes the exchange-only qubit especially attractive for use in many-qubit systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Reed W.

letter,A near-field radiative heat transfer device,"<p>Recently, several reports have experimentally shown near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) exceeding the far-field blackbody limit between planar surfaces. However, owing to the difficulties associated with maintaining the nanosized gap required for measuring a near-field enhancement, these demonstrations have been limited to experiments that cannot be implemented in large-scale devices. This poses a bottleneck to the deployment of NFRHT concepts in practical applications. Here, we describe a device bridging laboratory-scale measurements and potential NFRHT engineering applications in energy conversion and thermal management. We report a maximum NFRHT enhancement of approximately 28.5 over the blackbody limit with devices made of millimetre-sized doped Si surfaces separated by vacuum gap spacings down to approximately 110&#8201;nm. The devices use micropillars, separating the high-temperature emitter and low-temperature receiver, manufactured within micrometre-deep pits. These micropillars, which are about 4.5 to 45 times longer than the nanosize vacuum spacing at which radiation transfer takes place, minimize parasitic heat conduction without sacrificing the structural integrity of the device. The robustness of our devices enables gap spacing visualization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before performing NFRHT measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""John DeSutter"", ""Lei Tang"", ""Mathieu Francoeur""]","DeSutter, J., Tang, L. & Francoeur, M.

letter,Colossal infrared and terahertz magneto-optical activity in a two-dimensional Dirac material,"<p>When two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are exposed to a magnetic field, they resonantly absorb electromagnetic radiation via electronic transitions between Landau levels. In 2DEGs with a Dirac spectrum, such as graphene, theory predicts an exceptionally high infrared magneto-absorption, even at zero doping. However, the measured Landau-level magneto-optical effects in graphene have been much weaker than expected because of imperfections in the samples available for such experiments. Here, we measure magneto-transmission and Faraday rotation in high-mobility encapsulated monolayer graphene using a custom-designed set-up for magneto-infrared microspectroscopy. Our results show strongly enhanced magneto-optical activity in the infrared and terahertz ranges, characterized by absorption of light near to the 50% maximum allowed, 100% magnetic circular dichroism and high Faraday rotation. Considering that sizeable effects have been already observed at routinely achievable magnetic fields, our findings demonstrate the potential of magnetic tuning in 2D Dirac materials for long-wavelength optoelectronics and plasmonics.</p>",[],False,"[""Ievgeniia O.

article,Theoretical strength and rubber-like behaviour in micro-sized pyrolytic carbon,"<p>The creation of materials with a combination of high strength, substantial deformability and ductility, large elastic limit and low density represents a long-standing challenge, because these properties are, in general, mutually exclusive. Using a combination of two-photon lithography and high-temperature pyrolysis, we have created micro-sized pyrolytic carbon with a tensile strength of 1.60&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.55&#8201;GPa, a compressive strength approaching the theoretical limit of ~13.7&#8201;GPa, a substantial elastic limit of 20&#8211;30% and a low density of ~1.4&#8201;g&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>.

Pillars with diameters below 2.3&#8201;&#956;m exhibit rubber-like behaviour and sustain a compressive strain of ~50% without catastrophic failure; larger ones exhibit brittle fracture at a strain of ~20%. Large-scale atomistic simulations reveal that this combination of beneficial mechanical properties is enabled by the local deformation of 1&#8201;nm curled graphene fragments within the pyrolytic carbon microstructure, the interactions among neighbouring fragments and the presence of covalent carbon&#8211;carbon bonds.</p>",[],False,"[""Xuan Zhang"", ""Lei Zhong"", ""Arturo Mateos"", ""Akira Kudo"", ""Andrey Vyatskikh"", ""Huajian Gao"", ""Julia R.

Both yield the possibility of creating devices that directly harness spin and polarization as information carriers. Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides promise intrinsic spin-valley Hall features for free carriers, excitons and photons. Here we demonstrate spin- and valley-selective propagation of exciton-polaritons in a monolayer of MoSe<sub>2</sub> that is strongly coupled to a microcavity photon mode. In a wire-like device we trace the flow and helicity of exciton-polaritons expanding along its channel. By exciting a coherent superposition of K and K&#8242; tagged polaritons, we observe valley-selective expansion of the polariton cloud without either an external magnetic field or coherent Rayleigh scattering.

We address this challenge by combining deterministic shape-controlled nanowire transfer with spatially defined semiconductor-to-metal transformation to realize scalable nanowire field-effect transistor probe arrays with controllable tip geometry and sensor size, which enable recording of up to 100&#8201;mV intracellular action potentials from primary neurons.
