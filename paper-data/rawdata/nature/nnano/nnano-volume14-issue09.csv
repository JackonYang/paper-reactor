letter,Anomalous spin–orbit torques in magnetic single-layer films,"<p>The spin Hall effect couples charge and spin transport, enabling electrical control of magnetization. A quintessential example of spin-Hall-related transport is the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), first observed in 1880, in which an electric current perpendicular to the magnetization in a magnetic film generates charge accumulation on the surfaces. Here, we report the observation of a counterpart of the AHE that we term the anomalous spin&#8211;orbit torque (ASOT), wherein an electric current parallel to the magnetization generates opposite spin&#8211;orbit torques on the surfaces of the magnetic film. We interpret the ASOT as being due to a spin-Hall-like current generated with an efficiency of 0.053&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.003 in Ni<sub>80</sub>Fe<sub>20</sub>, comparable to the spin Hall angle of Pt. Similar effects are also observed in other common ferromagnetic metals, including Co, Ni and Fe. First-principles calculations corroborate the order of magnitude of the measured values. This work suggests that a strong spin current with spin polarization transverse to the magnetization can be generated within a ferromagnet, despite spin dephasing. The large magnitude of the ASOT should be taken into consideration when investigating spin&#8211;orbit torques in ferromagnetic/non-magnetic bilayers.</p>",[],False,"[""Wenrui Wang"", ""Tao Wang"", ""Vivek P.

article,Selective area growth and stencil lithography for in situ fabricated quantum devices,"<p>The interplay of Dirac physics and induced superconductivity at the interface of a 3D topological insulator (TI) with an s-wave superconductor (S) provides a new platform for topologically protected quantum computation based on elusive Majorana modes. To employ such S&#8211;TI hybrid devices in future topological quantum computation architectures, a process is required that allows for device fabrication under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Here, we report on the selective area growth of (Bi,Sb)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> TI thin films and stencil lithography of superconductive Nb for a full in situ fabrication of S&#8211;TI hybrid devices via molecular-beam epitaxy. A dielectric capping layer was deposited as a final step to protect the delicate surfaces of the S&#8211;TI hybrids at ambient conditions. Transport experiments in as-prepared Josephson junctions show highly transparent S&#8211;TI interfaces and a missing first Shapiro step, which indicates the presence of Majorana bound states. To move from single junctions towards complex circuitry for future topological quantum computation architectures, we monolithically integrated two aligned hardmasks to the substrate prior to growth. The presented process provides new possibilities to deliberately combine delicate quantum materials in situ at the nanoscale.</p>",[],False,"[""Peter Sch\u00fcffelgen"", ""Daniel Rosenbach"", ""Chuan Li"", ""Tobias W.

article,Dielectric disorder in two-dimensional materials,"<p>Understanding and controlling disorder is key to nanotechnology and materials science. Traditionally, disorder is attributed to local fluctuations of inherent material properties such as chemical and structural composition, doping or strain. Here, we present a fundamentally new source of disorder in nanoscale systems that is based entirely on the local changes of the Coulomb interaction due to fluctuations of the external dielectric environment. Using two-dimensional semiconductors as prototypes, we experimentally monitor dielectric disorder by probing the statistics and correlations of the exciton resonances, and theoretically analyse the influence of external screening and phonon scattering. Even moderate fluctuations of the dielectric environment are shown to induce large variations of the bandgap and exciton binding energies up to the 100&#8201;meV range, often making it a dominant source of inhomogeneities. As a consequence, dielectric disorder has strong implications for both the optical and transport properties of nanoscale materials and their heterostructures.</p>",[],False,"[""Archana Raja"", ""Lutz Waldecker"", ""Jonas Zipfel"", ""Yeongsu Cho"", ""Samuel Brem"", ""Jonas D.

article,Ultrafast coherent nonlinear nanooptics and nanoimaging of graphene,"<p>With its linear energy dispersion and large transition dipole matrix element, graphene is an attractive material for nonlinear optoelectronic applications. However, the mechanistic origin of its strong nonlinear response, the ultrafast coherent dynamics and the associated nanoscale phenomena have remained elusive due to a lack of suitable experimental techniques. Here, using adiabatic nanofocusing and imaging, we study the broadband four-wave mixing (FWM) response of graphene with nanometre and femtosecond spatio-temporal resolution. We detect a nonlinear signal enhancement at the edges and dependence on the number of layers from excitation areas as small as 10<sup>4</sup> carbon atoms. Femtosecond FWM nanoimaging and concomitant frequency-domain measurements reveal dephasing on T<sub>2</sub>&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1&#8201;fs timescales, which we attribute to a strong electron&#8211;electron interaction. We also identify an unusual non-local FWM response on ~100&#8211;400&#8201;nm length scales, which we assign to a Doppler effect controlling the nonlinear interaction between the tip near-field momenta and the graphene electrons with high Fermi velocity. These results illustrate the distinct nonlinear nanooptical properties of graphene, expected also in related classes of two-dimensional materials, that could form the basis for improved nonlinear and ultrafast nanophotonic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Tao Jiang"", ""Vasily Kravtsov"", ""Mikhail Tokman"", ""Alexey Belyanin"", ""Markus B.

article,Guiding of visible photons at the ångström thickness limit,"<p>Optical waveguides are vital components of data communication system technologies, but their scaling down to the nanoscale has remained challenging despite advances in nano-optics and nanomaterials. Recently, we theoretically predicted that the ultimate limit of visible photon guiding can be achieved in monolayer-thick transition metal dichalcogenides. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of light guiding in an atomically thick tungsten disulfide membrane patterned as a photonic crystal structure. In this scheme, two-dimensional tungsten disulfide excitonic photoluminescence couples into quasi-guided photonic crystal modes known as resonant-type Wood&#8217;s anomalies. These modes propagate via total internal reflection with only a small portion of the light diffracted to the far field. Such light guiding at the ultimate limit provides more possibilities to miniaturize optoelectronic devices and to test fundamental physical concepts.</p>",[],False,"[""Xingwang Zhang"", ""Chawina De-Eknamkul"", ""Jie Gu"", ""Alexandra L.

article,High temperature shockwave stabilized single atoms,"<p>The stability of single-atom catalysts is critical for their practical applications. Although a high temperature can promote the bond formation between metal atoms and the substrate with an enhanced stability, it often causes atom agglomeration and is incompatible with many temperature-sensitive substrates. Here, we report using controllable high-temperature shockwaves to synthesize and stabilize single atoms at very high temperatures (1,500&#8211;2,000&#8201;K), achieved by a periodic on&#8211;off heating that features a short on state (55&#8201;ms) and a ten-times longer off state. The high temperature provides the activation energy for atom dispersion by forming thermodynamically favourable metal&#8211;defect bonds and the off-state critically ensures the overall stability, especially for the substrate. The resultant high-temperature single atoms exhibit a superior thermal stability as durable catalysts. The reported shockwave method is facile, ultrafast and universal (for example, Pt, Ru and Co single atoms, and carbon, C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub> substrates), which opens a general route for single-atom manufacturing that is conventionally challenging.</p>",[],False,"[""Yonggang Yao"", ""Zhennan Huang"", ""Pengfei Xie"", ""Lianping Wu"", ""Lu Ma"", ""Tangyuan Li"", ""Zhenqian Pang"", ""Miaolun Jiao"", ""Zhiqiang Liang"", ""Jinlong Gao"", ""Yang He"", ""Dylan Jacob Kline"", ""Michael R.

article,Step-defect guided delivery of DNA to a graphene nanopore,"<p>Precision placement and transport of biomolecules are critical to many single-molecule manipulation and detection methods. One such method is nanopore sequencing, in which the delivery of biomolecules towards a nanopore controls the method&#8217;s throughput. Using all-atom molecular dynamics, here we show that the precision transport of biomolecules can be realized by utilizing ubiquitous features of graphene surface-step defects that separate multilayer domains. Subject to an external force, we found that adsorbed DNA moved much faster down a step defect than up, and even faster along the defect edge, regardless of whether the motion was produced by a mechanical force or a solvent flow. We utilized this direction dependency to demonstrate a mechanical analogue of an electric diode and a system for delivering DNA molecules to a nanopore. The defect-guided delivery principle can be used for the separation, concentration and storage of scarce biomolecular species, on-demand chemical reactions and nanopore sensing.</p>",[],False,"[""Manish Shankla"", ""Aleksei Aksimentiev""]","Shankla, M., Aksimentiev, A.

The field is slowed by the current need for human intuition during three-dimensional structural design. Here, we demonstrate that three distinct problems in RNA nanotechnology can be reduced to a pathfinding problem and automatically solved through an algorithm called RNAMake. First, RNAMake discovers highly stable single-chain solutions to the classic problem of aligning a tetraloop and its sequence-distal receptor, with experimental validation from chemical mapping, gel electrophoresis, solution X-ray scattering and crystallography with 2.55&#8201;&#197; resolution. Second, RNAMake automatically generates structured tethers that integrate 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs into single-chain ribosomal RNAs that remain uncleaved by ribonucleases and assemble onto messenger RNA. Third, RNAMake enables the automated stabilization of small-molecule binding RNAs, with designed tertiary contacts that improve the binding affinity of the ATP aptamer and improve the fluorescence and stability of the Spinach RNA in cell extracts and in living Escherichia coli cells.</p>",[],False,"[""Joseph D.

article,Glutathione-mediated biotransformation in the liver modulates nanoparticle transport,"<p>Glutathione-mediated biotransformation in the liver is a well-known detoxification process to eliminate small xenobiotics, but its impacts on nanoparticle retention, targeting and clearance are much less understood than liver macrophage uptake, even though both processes are involved in liver detoxification. By designing a thiol-activatable fluorescent gold nanoprobe that can bind to serum protein and be transported to the liver, we non-invasively imaged the biotransformation kinetics in vivo at high specificity and examined this process at the chemical level. Our results show that glutathione efflux from hepatocytes results in high local concentrations of both glutathione and cysteine in liver sinusoids, which transforms the nanoparticle surface chemistry, reduces its affinity to serum protein and significantly alters its blood retention, targeting and clearance. With this biotransformation, liver detoxification, a long-standing barrier in nanomedicine translation, can be turned into a bridge toward maximizing targeting and minimizing nanotoxicity.</p>",[],False,"[""Xingya Jiang"", ""Bujie Du"", ""Jie Zheng""]","Jiang, X., Du, B. & Zheng, J.

However, their intrinsic catalytic activity, which can enable an increased detection sensitivity, has yet to be explored for in vivo sensing. By exploiting the peroxidase-mimicking activity of AuNCs and the precise nanometre-size filtration of the kidney, we designed multifunctional protease nanosensors that respond to disease microenvironments to produce a direct colorimetric urinary readout of the disease state in less than one hour. We monitored the catalytic activity of AuNCs in the collected urine of a mouse model of colorectal cancer in which tumour-bearing mice showed a 13-fold increase in colorimetric signal compared to healthy mice.

article,Immunization with mannosylated nanovaccines and inhibition of the immune-suppressing microenvironment sensitizes melanoma to immune checkpoint modulators,"<p>A low response rate, acquired resistance and severe side effects have limited the clinical outcomes of immune checkpoint therapy.

Prophylactic and therapeutic combination regimens of dendritic cell-targeted mannosylated nanovaccines with &#945;PD-1/&#945;OX40 demonstrate a synergism that stimulates T-cell infiltration into tumours at early treatment stages.

Combining the double therapy with ibrutinib, a myeloid-derived suppressor cell inhibitor, leads to a remarkable tumour remission and prolonged survival in melanoma-bearing mice.
