review article,Path towards graphene commercialization from lab to market,"<p>The ground-breaking demonstration of the electric field effect in graphene reported more than a decade ago prompted the strong push towards the commercialization of graphene as evidenced by a wealth of graphene research, patents and applications. Graphene flake production capability has reached thousands of tonnes per year, while continuous graphene sheets of tens of metres in length have become available. Various graphene technologies developed in laboratories have now transformed into commercial products, with the very first demonstrations in sports goods, automotive coatings, conductive inks and touch screens, to name a few. Although challenges related to quality control in graphene materials remain to be addressed, the advancement in the understandings of graphene will propel the commercial success of graphene as a compelling technology.

letter,Current-induced magnetization switching in all-oxide heterostructures,"<p>The electrical switching of magnetization through spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) holds promise for application in information technologies, such as low-power, non-volatile magnetic memory. Materials with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, such as heavy metals and topological insulators, can convert a charge current into a spin current. The spin current can then execute a transfer torque on the magnetization of a neighbouring magnetic layer, usually a ferromagnetic metal like CoFeB, and reverse its magnetization. Here, we combine a ferromagnetic transition metal oxide with an oxide with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling to demonstrate all-oxide SOT devices. We show current-induced magnetization switching in SrIrO<sub>3</sub>/SrRuO<sub>3</sub> bilayer structures. By controlling the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of SrRuO<sub>3</sub> on (001)- and (110)-oriented SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (STO) substrates, we designed two types of SOT switching schemes. For the bilayer on the STO(001) substrate, a magnetic-field-free switching was achieved, which remained undisturbed even when the external magnetic field reached 100&#8201;mT. The charge-to-spin conversion efficiency for the bilayer on the STO(110) substrate ranged from 0.58 to 0.86, depending on the directionality of the current flow with respect to the crystalline symmetry. All-oxide SOT structures may help to realize field-free switching through a magnetocrystalline anisotropy design.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Liang Liu', ',\xa0Qing Qin', ',\xa0Weinan Lin', ',\xa0Changjian Li', ',\xa0Qidong Xie', ',\xa0Xinyu Shu', ',\xa0Chenghang Zhou', ',\xa0Jihang Yu', ',\xa0Mengsha Li', ',\xa0Xiaobing Yan', ',\xa0Stephen J.

letter,All-electric magnetization switching and Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction in WTe2/ferromagnet heterostructures,"<p>All-electric magnetization manipulation at low power is a prerequisite for a wide adoption of spintronic devices. Materials such as heavy metals or topological insulators provide good charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies. They enable magnetization switching in heterostructures with either metallic ferromagnets or with magnetic insulators. Recent work suggests a pronounced Edelstein effect in Weyl semimetals due to their non-trivial band structure; the Edelstein effect can be one order of magnitude stronger than it is in topological insulators or Rashba systems. Furthermore, the strong intrinsic spin Hall effect from the bulk states in Weyl semimetals can contribute to the spin current generation. The Td phase of the Weyl semimetal WTe<sub>2</sub> (WTe<sub>2</sub> hereafter) possesses strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling and non-trivial band structures with a large spin polarization protected by time-reversal symmetry in both the surface and bulk states. Atomically flat surfaces, which can be produced with high quality, facilitate spintronic device applications. Here, we use WTe<sub>2</sub> as a spin current source in WTe<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>81</sub>Fe<sub>19</sub> (Py) heterostructures. We report field-free current-induced magnetization switching at room temperature. A charge current density of ~2.96&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>5</sup>&#8201;A&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> suffices to switch the magnetization of the Py layer. With the charge current along the b axis of the WTe<sub>2</sub> layer, the thickness-dependent charge-to-spin conversion efficiency reaches 0.51 at 6&#8211;7&#8201;GHz. At the WTe<sub>2</sub>/Py interface, a Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) with a DMI constant of &#8722;1.78&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.06&#8201;mJ&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> induces chiral domain wall tilting.

letter,In situ interface engineering for probing the limit of quantum dot photovoltaic devices,"<p>Quantum dot (QD) photovoltaic devices are attractive for their low-cost synthesis, tunable band gap and potentially high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the experimentally achieved efficiency to date remains far from ideal. Here, we report an in-situ fabrication and investigation of single TiO<sub>2</sub>-nanowire/CdSe-QD heterojunction solar cell (QDHSC) using a custom-designed photoelectric transmission electron microscope (TEM) holder. A mobile counter electrode is used to precisely tune the interface area for in situ photoelectrical measurements, which reveals a strong interface area dependent PCE. Theoretical simulations show that the simplified single nanowire solar cell structure can minimize the interface area and associated charge scattering to enable an efficient charge collection. Additionally, the optical antenna effect of nanowire-based QDHSCs can further enhance the absorption and boost the PCE.

letter,Robust graphene-based molecular devices,"<p>One of the main challenges to upscale the fabrication of molecular devices is to achieve a mechanically stable device with reproducible and controllable electronic features that operates at room temperature. This is crucial because structural and electronic fluctuations can lead to significant changes in the transport characteristics at the electrode&#8211;molecule interface. In this study, we report on the realization of a mechanically and electronically robust graphene-based molecular junction. Robustness was achieved by separating the requirements for mechanical and electronic stability at the molecular level. Mechanical stability was obtained by anchoring molecules directly to the substrate, rather than to graphene electrodes, using a silanization reaction. Electronic stability was achieved by adjusting the &#960;&#8211;&#960; orbitals overlap of the conjugated head groups between neighbouring molecules. The molecular devices exhibited stable current&#8211;voltage (I&#8211;V) characteristics up to bias voltages of 2.0&#8201;V with reproducible transport features in the temperature range from 20 to 300&#8201;K.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Transport at Nanoscale Interfaces Laboratory, Dübendorf, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Maria El Abbassi', ',\xa0Mickael Lucien Perrin', ',\xa0Oliver Braun', '\xa0&\xa0Michel Calame']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Maria El Abbassi', ',\xa0Oliver Braun', '\xa0&\xa0Michel Calame']}, {'address': 'Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Maria El Abbassi', '\xa0&\xa0Herre Sjoerd Jan van der Zant']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK', 'authors': ['Sara Sangtarash', ',\xa0Colin Lambert', '\xa0&\xa0Hatef Sadeghi']}, {'address': 'School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK', 'authors': ['Sara Sangtarash', '\xa0&\xa0Hatef Sadeghi']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Xunshan Liu', ',\xa0Silvio Decurtins', '\xa0&\xa0Shi-Xia Liu']}, {'address': 'Institute of Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel', 'authors': ['Shlomo Yitzchaik']}, {'address': 'Swiss Nanoscience Institute, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Michel Calame']}]",False,"['Maria El Abbassi', 'Sara Sangtarash', 'Xunshan Liu', 'Mickael Lucien Perrin', 'Oliver Braun', 'Colin Lambert', 'Herre Sjoerd Jan van der Zant', 'Shlomo Yitzchaik', 'Silvio Decurtins', 'Shi-Xia Liu', 'Hatef Sadeghi', 'Michel Calame']","El Abbassi, M., Sangtarash, S., Liu, X. et al.

letter,Atomically thin micas as proton-conducting membranes,"<p>Monolayers of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are highly permeable to thermal protons. For thicker two-dimensional (2D) materials, proton conductivity diminishes exponentially, so that, for example, monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> that is just three atoms thick is completely impermeable to protons. This seemed to suggest that only one-atom-thick crystals could be used as proton-conducting membranes. Here, we show that few-layer micas that are rather thick on the atomic scale become excellent proton conductors if native cations are ion-exchanged for protons. Their areal conductivity exceeds that of graphene and hBN by one to two orders of magnitude. Importantly, ion-exchanged 2D micas exhibit this high conductivity inside the infamous gap for proton-conducting materials, which extends from &#8764;100&#8201;&#176;C to 500&#8201;&#176;C. Areal conductivity of proton-exchanged monolayer micas can reach above 100&#8201;S&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> at 500&#8201;&#176;C, well above the current requirements for the industry roadmap. We attribute the fast proton permeation to ~5-&#197;-wide tubular channels that perforate micas&#8217; crystal structure, which, after ion exchange, contain only hydroxyl groups inside. Our work indicates that there could be other 2D crystals with similar nanometre-scale channels, which could help close the materials gap in proton-conducting applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National Graphene Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK', 'authors': ['L.

letter,Remotely controlled chemomagnetic modulation of targeted neural circuits,"<p>Connecting neural circuit output to behaviour can be facilitated by the precise chemical manipulation of specific cell populations. Engineered receptors exclusively activated by designer small molecules enable manipulation of specific neural pathways. However, their application to studies of behaviour has thus far been hampered by a trade-off between the low temporal resolution of systemic injection versus the invasiveness of implanted cannulae or infusion pumps. Here, we developed a remotely controlled chemomagnetic modulation&#8212;a nanomaterials-based technique that permits the pharmacological interrogation of targeted neural populations in freely moving subjects. The heat dissipated by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the presence of alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) triggers small-molecule release from thermally sensitive lipid vesicles with a 20&#8201;s latency. Coupled with the chemogenetic activation of engineered receptors, this technique permits the control of specific neurons with temporal and spatial precision. The delivery of chemomagnetic particles to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) allows the remote modulation of motivated behaviour in mice. Furthermore, this chemomagnetic approach activates endogenous circuits by enabling the regulated release of receptor ligands. Applied to an endogenous dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) agonist in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain area involved in mediating social interactions, chemomagnetic modulation increases sociability in mice. By offering a temporally precise control of specified ligand&#8211;receptor interactions in neurons, this approach may facilitate molecular neuroscience studies in behaving organisms.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Siyuan Rao', ',\xa0Michael G.

letter,A biodegradable nanocapsule delivers a Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex for in vivo genome editing,"<p>Delivery technologies for the CRISPR-Cas9 (CRISPR, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) gene editing system often require viral vectors, which pose safety concerns for therapeutic genome editing. Alternatively, cationic liposomal components or polymers can be used to encapsulate multiple CRISPR components into large particles (typically &gt;100&#8201;nm diameter); however, such systems are limited by variability in the loading of the cargo. Here, we report the design of customizable synthetic nanoparticles for the delivery of Cas9 nuclease and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that enables the controlled stoichiometry of CRISPR components and limits the possible safety concerns in vivo. We describe the synthesis of a thin glutathione (GSH)-cleavable covalently crosslinked polymer coating, called a nanocapsule (NC), around a preassembled ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex between a Cas9 nuclease and an sgRNA. The NC is synthesized by in situ polymerization, has a hydrodynamic diameter of 25&#8201;nm and can be customized via facile surface modification. NCs efficiently generate targeted gene edits in vitro without any apparent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, NCs produce robust gene editing in vivo in murine retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tissue and skeletal muscle after local administration. This customizable NC nanoplatform efficiently delivers CRISPR RNP complexes for in vitro and in vivo somatic gene editing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI, USA', 'authors': ['Guojun Chen', ',\xa0Yuyuan Wang', ',\xa0Ruosen Xie', '\xa0&\xa0Shaoqin Gong']}, {'address': 'Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI, USA', 'authors': ['Guojun Chen', ',\xa0Amr A.

article,High-speed imaging of surface-enhanced Raman scattering fluctuations from individual nanoparticles,"<p>The concept of plasmonic hotspots is central to the interpretation of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. Although plasmonic hotspots are generally portrayed as static features, single-molecule SERS (SM-SERS) is marked by characteristic time-dependent fluctuations in signal intensity. The origin of those fluctuations can be assigned to a variety of dynamic and complex processes, including molecular adsorption or desorption, surface diffusion, molecular reorientation and metal surface reconstruction. Since each of these mechanisms simultaneously contributes to a fluctuating SERS signal, probing their relative impact in SM-SERS remains an experimental challenge. Here, we introduce a super-resolution imaging technique with an acquisition rate of 800,000 frames per second to probe the spatial and temporal features of the SM-SERS fluctuations from single silver nanoshells. The technique has a spatial resolution of ~7&#8201;nm. The images reveal short ~10&#8201;&#181;s scattering events localized in various regions on a single nanoparticle. Remarkably, even a fully functionalized nanoparticle was &#8216;dark&#8217; more than 98% of the time. The sporadic SERS emission suggests a transient hotspot formation mechanism driven by a random reconstruction of the metallic surface, an effect that dominates over any plasmonic resonance of the particle itself. Our results provide the SERS community with a high-speed experimental approach to study the fast dynamic properties of SM-SERS hotspots in typical room-temperature experimental conditions, with possible implications in catalysis and sensing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Engineering, Bethel University, St Paul, MN, USA', 'authors': ['Nathan C.

article,A modular DNA scaffold to study protein–protein interactions at single-molecule resolution,"<p>The residence time of a drug on its target has been suggested as a more pertinent metric of therapeutic efficacy than the traditionally used affinity constant. Here, we introduce junctured-DNA tweezers as a generic platform that enables real-time observation, at the single-molecule level, of biomolecular interactions. This tool corresponds to a double-strand DNA scaffold that can be nanomanipulated and on which proteins of interest can be engrafted thanks to widely used genetic tagging strategies. Thus, junctured-DNA tweezers allow a straightforward and robust access to single-molecule force spectroscopy in drug discovery, and more generally in biophysics. Proof-of-principle experiments are provided for the rapamycin-mediated association between FKBP12 and FRB, a system relevant in both medicine and chemical biology. Individual interactions were monitored under a range of applied forces and temperatures, yielding after analysis the characteristic features of the energy profile along the dissociation landscape.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Ecole Normale Supérieure, Institut de Biologie de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure (IBENS) CNRS, INSERM, PSL Research University, Paris, France', 'authors': ['Dorota Kostrz', ',\xa0Maryne Follenfant', ',\xa0Terence R.
