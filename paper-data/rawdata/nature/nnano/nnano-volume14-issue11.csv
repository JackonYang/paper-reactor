letter,Picosecond coherent electron motion in a silicon single-electron source,"<p>An advanced understanding of ultrafast coherent electron dynamics is necessary for the application of submicrometre devices under a non-equilibrium drive to quantum technology, including on-demand single-electron sources, electron quantum optics, qubit control, quantum sensing and quantum metrology. Although electron dynamics along an extended channel has been studied extensively, it is hard to capture the electron motion inside submicrometre devices. The frequency of the internal, coherent dynamics is typically higher than 100&#8201;GHz, beyond the state-of-the-art experimental bandwidth of less than 10&#8201;GHz (refs. ). Although the dynamics can be detected by means of a surface-acoustic-wave quantum dot, this method does not allow for a time-resolved detection. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate how we can observe the internal dynamics in a silicon single-electron source that comprises a dynamic quantum dot in an effective time-resolved fashion with picosecond resolution using a resonant level as a detector. The experimental observations and the simulations with realistic parameters show that a non-adiabatically excited electron wave packet spatially oscillates quantum coherently at ~250&#8201;GHz inside the source at 4.2&#8201;K. The developed technique may, in future, enable the detection of fast dynamics in cavities, the control of non-adiabatic excitations or a single-electron source that emits engineered wave packets. With such achievements, high-fidelity initialization of flying qubits, high-resolution and high-speed electromagnetic-field sensing and high-accuracy current sources may become possible.</p>",,"[{'address': 'NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan', 'authors': ['Gento Yamahata', ',\xa0Nathan Johnson', '\xa0&\xa0Akira Fujiwara']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea', 'authors': ['Sungguen Ryu', '\xa0&\xa0H.-S.

letter,A room-temperature polariton light-emitting diode based on monolayer WS2,"<p>Exciton polaritons that arise through the strong coupling of excitons and cavity photons are used to demonstrate a wide array of fundamental phenomena and potential applications that range from Bose&#8211;Einstein-like condensation to analogue Hamiltonian simulators and chip-scale interferometers. Recently, the two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), because of their large exciton binding energies, oscillator strength and valley degree of freedom, have emerged as a very attractive platform to realize exciton polaritons at elevated temperatures. Achieving the electrical injection of polaritons is attractive both as a precursor to realizing electrically driven polariton lasers as well as for high speed light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for communication systems. Here, we demonstrate an electrically driven polariton LED that operates at room temperature using monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) as the emissive material. The extracted external quantum efficiency is ~0.1% and is comparable to recent demonstrations of bulk organic and carbon nanotube-based polariton electroluminescence (EL) devices. The possibility to realize electrically driven polariton LEDs in atomically thin semiconductors at room temperature presents a promising step towards achieving an inversionless electrically driven laser in these systems as well as for ultrafast microcavity LEDs using van der Waals (vdW) materials.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, City College of New York, City University of New York, New York, USA', 'authors': ['Jie Gu', ',\xa0Biswanath Chakraborty', ',\xa0Mandeep Khatoniar', '\xa0&\xa0Vinod M.

letter,Tunable crystal symmetry in graphene–boron nitride heterostructures with coexisting moiré superlattices,"<p>In van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures consisting of atomically thin crystals layered on top of one another, lattice mismatch and rotation between the layers can result in long-wavelength moir&#233; superlattices. These moir&#233; patterns can drive notable band structure reconstruction of the composite material, leading to a wide range of emergent phenomena including superconductivity, magnetism, fractional Chern insulating states and moir&#233; excitons. Here, we investigate devices consisting of monolayer graphene encapsulated between two crystals of boron nitride (BN), in which the rotational alignment of all three components is controlled. We find that bandgaps in the graphene arising from perfect rotational alignment with both BN layers can be modified considerably depending on whether the relative orientation of the two BN layers is 0&#176; or 60&#176;, suggesting a tunable transition between the absence or presence of inversion symmetry in the heterostructure. Small deviations (&lt;1&#176;) from perfect alignment of all three layers leads to coexisting long-wavelength moir&#233; potentials, resulting in a highly reconstructed graphene band structure featuring multiple secondary Dirac points. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between multiple moir&#233; patterns can be utilized to controllably modify the symmetry and electronic properties of the composite heterostructure.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA', 'authors': ['Nathan R.

article,Hot-electron dynamics in quantum dots manipulated by spin-exchange Auger interactions,"<p>The ability to effectively manipulate non-equilibrium &#8216;hot&#8217; carriers could enable novel schemes for highly efficient energy harvesting and interconversion. In the case of semiconductor materials, realization of such hot-carrier schemes is complicated by extremely fast intraband cooling (picosecond to subpicosecond time scales) due to processes such as phonon emission. Here we show that using magnetically doped colloidal semiconductor quantum dots we can achieve extremely fast rates of spin-exchange processes that allow for &#8216;uphill&#8217; energy transfer with an energy-gain rate that greatly exceeds the intraband cooling rate. This represents a dramatic departure from the usual situation where energy-dissipation via phonon emission outpaces energy gains due to standard Auger-type energy transfer at least by a factor of three. A highly favourable energy gain/loss rate ratio realized in magnetically doped quantum dots can enable effective schemes for capturing kinetic energy of hot, unrelaxed carriers via processes such as spin-exchange-mediated carrier multiplication and upconversion, hot-carrier extraction and electron photoemission.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Chemistry Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA', 'authors': ['Rohan Singh', ',\xa0Wenyong Liu', ',\xa0Jaehoon Lim', ',\xa0István Robel', '\xa0&\xa0Victor I.

article,Origin of lithium whisker formation and growth under stress,"<p>Lithium metal has the lowest standard electrochemical redox potential and very high theoretical specific capacity, making it the ultimate anode material for rechargeable batteries. However, its application in batteries has been impeded by the formation of Li whiskers, which consume the electrolyte, deplete active Li and may lead to short-circuit of the battery. Tackling these issues successfully is dependent on acquiring sufficient understanding of the formation mechanisms and growth of Li whiskers under the mechanical constraints of a separator. Here, by coupling an atomic force microscopy cantilever into a solid open-cell set-up in environmental transmission electron microscopy, we directly capture the nucleation and growth behaviour of Li whiskers under elastic constraint. We show that Li deposition is initiated by a sluggish nucleation of a single crystalline Li particle, with no preferential growth directions. Remarkably, we find that retarded surface transport of Li plays a decisive role in the subsequent deposition morphology. We then explore the validity of these findings in practical cells using a series of carbonate-poisoned ether-based electrolytes. Finally, we show that Li whiskers can yield, buckle, kink or stop growing under certain elastic constraints.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA', 'authors': ['Yang He', ',\xa0Yaobin Xu', ',\xa0Mark H.

article,Artificial phototropism for omnidirectional tracking and harvesting of light,"<p>Many living organisms track light sources and halt their movement when alignment is achieved. This phenomenon, known as phototropism, occurs, for example, when plants self-orient to face the sun throughout the day. Although many artificial smart materials exhibit non-directional, nastic behaviour in response to an external stimulus, no synthetic material can intrinsically detect and accurately track the direction of the stimulus, that is, exhibit tropistic behaviour. Here we report an artificial phototropic system based on nanostructured stimuli-responsive polymers that can aim and align to the incident light direction in the three-dimensions over a broad temperature range. Such adaptive reconfiguration is realized through a built-in feedback loop rooted in the photothermal and mechanical properties of the material. This system is termed a sunflower-like biomimetic omnidirectional tracker (SunBOT). We show that an array of SunBOTs can, in principle, be used in solar vapour generation devices, as it achieves up to a 400% solar energy-harvesting enhancement over non-tropistic materials at oblique illumination angles. The principle behind our SunBOTs is universal and can be extended to many responsive materials and a broad range of stimuli.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Material Science and Engineering, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Xiaoshi Qian', ',\xa0Yusen Zhao', ',\xa0Yousif Alsaid', ',\xa0Mutian Hua', ',\xa0Yunyun Yang', ',\xa0Jinsong Cui', ',\xa0Ning Liu', '\xa0&\xa0Ximin He']}, {'address': 'School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA', 'authors': ['Xu Wang', ',\xa0Hamsini Gopalakrishna', '\xa0&\xa0Hanqing Jiang']}, {'address': 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Tiphaine Galy', ',\xa0Michal Marszewski', '\xa0&\xa0Laurent Pilon']}, {'address': 'California Nanosystems Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Ximin He']}]",False,"['Xiaoshi Qian', 'Yusen Zhao', 'Yousif Alsaid', 'Xu Wang', 'Mutian Hua', 'Tiphaine Galy', 'Hamsini Gopalakrishna', 'Yunyun Yang', 'Jinsong Cui', 'Ning Liu', 'Michal Marszewski', 'Laurent Pilon', 'Hanqing Jiang', 'Ximin He']","Qian, X., Zhao, Y., Alsaid, Y. et al.

article,Rectification of protein translocation in truncated pyramidal nanopores,"<p>Solid-state nanopore technology presents an emerging single-molecule-based analytical tool for the separation and analysis of nanoparticles. Different approaches have been pursued to attain the anticipated detection performance. Here, we report the rectification behaviour of protein translocation through silicon-based truncated pyramidal nanopores. When the size of translocating proteins is comparable to the smallest physical constriction of the nanopore, the frequency of translocation events observed is lower for proteins that travel from the larger to the small opening of the nanopore than for those that travel in the reverse direction. When the proteins are appreciably smaller than the nanopore, an opposite rectification in the frequency of translocation events is evident. The maximum rectification factor achieved is around ten. Numerical simulations reveal the formation of an electro-osmotic vortex in such asymmetric nanopores. The vortex&#8211;protein interaction is found to play a decisive role in rectifying the translocation in terms of polarity and amplitude. The reported phenomenon can be potentially exploitable for the discrimination of various nanoparticles.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Solid-State Electronics, Department of Engineering Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden', 'authors': ['Shuangshuang Zeng', ',\xa0Chenyu Wen', ',\xa0Shi-Li Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Zhen Zhang']}, {'address': 'IBM T.J.

article,Mechanistic reaction pathways of enhanced ethylene yields during electroreduction of CO2–CO co-feeds on Cu and Cu-tandem electrocatalysts,"<p>Unlike energy efficiency and selectivity challenges, the kinetic effects of impure or intentionally mixed CO<sub>2</sub> feeds on the catalytic reactivity of the direct electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO2RR) have been poorly studied. Given that industrial CO<sub>2</sub> feeds are often contaminated with CO, a closer investigation of the CO2RR under CO<sub>2</sub>/CO co-feed conditions is warranted. Here, we report mechanistic insights into the CO2RR reactivity of CO<sub>2</sub>/CO co-feeds on Cu-based nanocatalysts. Kinetic isotope-labelling experiments&#8212;performed in an operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry capillary flow cell with millisecond time resolution&#8212;showed an unexpected enhanced production of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, with a yield increase of almost 50%, from a cross-coupled <sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>&#8211;<sup>13</sup>CO reactive pathway. The results suggest the absence of site competition between CO<sub>2</sub> and CO molecules on the reactive surface at the reactant-specific sites.

article,A non-precious metal hydrogen catalyst in a commercial polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyser,"<p>We demonstrate the translation of a low-cost, non-precious metal cobalt phosphide (CoP) catalyst from 1&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup> lab-scale experiments to a commercial-scale 86&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup> polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser. A two-step bulk synthesis was adopted to produce CoP on a high-surface-area carbon support that was readily integrated into an industrial PEM electrolyser fabrication process. The performance of the CoP was compared head to head with a platinum-based PEM under the same operating conditions (400&#8201;psi, 50&#8201;&#176;C). CoP was found to be active and stable, operating at 1.86&#8201;A&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> for&#8201;&gt;1,700&#8201;h of continuous hydrogen production while providing substantial material cost savings relative to platinum. This work illustrates a potential pathway for non-precious hydrogen evolution catalysts developed in past decades to translate to commercial applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Shriram Center, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Laurie A.

article,Fast and compact DNA logic circuits based on single-stranded gates using strand-displacing polymerase,"<p>DNA is a reliable biomolecule with which to build molecular computation systems. In particular, DNA logic circuits (diffusion-based) have shown good performance regarding scalability and correctness of computation. However, previous architectures of DNA logic circuits have two limitations. First, the speed of computation is slow, often requiring hours to compute a simple function. Second, the circuits are of high complexity regarding the number of DNA strands. Here, we introduce an architecture of DNA logic circuits based on single-stranded logic gates using strand-displacing DNA polymerase. The logic gates consist of only single DNA strands, which largely reduces leakage reactions and signal restoration steps such that the circuits are improved in regard to both speed of computation and the number of DNA strands needed. Large-scale logic circuits can be constructed from the gates by simple cascading strategies. In particular, we have demonstrated a fast and compact logic circuit that computes the square-root function of four-bit input numbers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Computer Science, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA', 'authors': ['Tianqi Song', ',\xa0Daniel Fu', ',\xa0Ming Yang', ',\xa0Reem Mokhtar', '\xa0&\xa0John Reif']}, {'address': 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Menoufia University, Menouf, Egypt', 'authors': ['Abeer Eshra']}, {'address': 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA', 'authors': ['Shalin Shah', '\xa0&\xa0John Reif']}, {'address': 'National Research Council, Washington, DC, USA', 'authors': ['Hieu Bui']}]",False,"['Tianqi Song', 'Abeer Eshra', 'Shalin Shah', 'Hieu Bui', 'Daniel Fu', 'Ming Yang', 'Reem Mokhtar', 'John Reif']","Song, T., Eshra, A., Shah, S. et al.
