review article,Nanotechnology intervention of the microbiome for cancer therapy,"<p>The microbiome is emerging as a key player and driver of cancer. Traditional modalities to manipulate the microbiome (for example, antibiotics, probiotics and microbiota transplants) have been shown to improve efficacy of cancer therapies in some cases, but issues such as collateral damage to the commensal microbiota and consistency of these approaches motivates efforts towards developing new technologies specifically designed for the microbiome&#8211;cancer interface. Considering the success of nanotechnology in transforming cancer diagnostics and treatment, nanotechnologies capable of manipulating interactions that occur across microscopic and molecular length scales in the microbiome and the tumour microenvironment have the potential to provide innovative strategies for cancer treatment. As such, opportunities at the intersection of nanotechnology, the microbiome and cancer are massive. In this Review, we highlight key opportunistic areas for applying nanotechnologies towards manipulating the microbiome for the treatment of cancer, give an overview of seminal work and discuss future challenges and our perspective on this emerging area.</p>",[],False,"[""Wantong Song"", ""Aaron C.

letter,Valley-polarized exciton currents in a van der Waals heterostructure,"<p>Valleytronics is an appealing alternative to conventional charge-based electronics that aims at encoding data in the valley degree of freedom, that is, the information as to which extreme of the conduction or valence band carriers are occupying. The ability to create and control valley currents in solid-state devices could therefore enable new paradigms for information processing. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are a promising platform for valleytronics due to the presence of two inequivalent valleys with spin&#8211;valley locking and a direct bandgap, which allows optical initialization and readout of the valley state. Recent progress on the control of interlayer excitons in these materials could offer an effective way to realize optoelectronic devices based on the valley degree of freedom. Here, we show the generation and transport over mesoscopic distances of valley-polarized excitons in a device based on a type-II TMDC heterostructure. Engineering of the interlayer coupling results in enhanced diffusion of valley-polarized excitons, which can be controlled and switched electrically. Furthermore, using electrostatic traps, we can increase the exciton concentration by an order of magnitude, reaching densities in the order of 10<sup>12</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, opening the route to achieving a coherent quantum state of valley-polarized excitons via Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation.</p>",[],False,"[""Dmitrii Unuchek"", ""Alberto Ciarrocchi"", ""Ahmet Avsar"", ""Zhe Sun"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Andras Kis""]","Unuchek, D., Ciarrocchi, A., Avsar, A. et al.

letter,Upconversion superburst with sub-2 μs lifetime,"<p>The generation of anti-Stokes emission through lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles is of great importance for technological applications in energy harvesting, bioimaging and optical cryptography. However, the weak absorption and long radiative lifetimes of upconversion nanoparticles may significantly limit their use in imaging and labelling applications in which a fast spontaneous emission rate is essential. Here, we report the direct observation of upconversion superburst with directional, fast and ultrabright luminescence by coupling gap plasmon modes to nanoparticle emitters. Through precise control over the nanoparticle&#8217;s local density of state, we achieve emission amplification by four to five orders of magnitude and a 166-fold rate increase in spontaneous emission. We also demonstrate that tailoring the mode of the plasmonic cavity permits active control over the colour output of upconversion emission. These findings may benefit the future development of rapid nonlinear image scanning nanoscopy and open up the possibility of constructing high-frequency, single-photon emitters driven by telecommunication wavelengths.</p>",[],False,"[""Yiming Wu"", ""Jiahui Xu"", ""Eng Tuan Poh"", ""Liangliang Liang"", ""Hailong Liu"", ""Joel K.

article,Determining the phase diagram of atomically thin layered antiferromagnet CrCl3,"<p>Changes in the spin configuration of atomically thin, magnetic van der Waals multilayers can cause drastic modifications in their opto-electronic properties. Conversely, the opto-electronic response of these systems provides information about the magnetic state, which is very difficult to obtain otherwise. Here, we show that in CrCl<sub>3</sub> multilayers, the dependence of the tunnelling conductance on applied magnetic field, temperature and number of layers tracks the evolution of the magnetic state, enabling the magnetic phase diagram to be determined experimentally. Besides a high-field spin-flip transition occurring for all thicknesses, the in-plane magnetoconductance exhibits an even&#8211;odd effect due to a low-field spin-flop transition. Through a quantitative analysis of the phenomena, we determine the interlayer exchange coupling as well as the layer magnetization and show that in CrCl<sub>3</sub> shape anisotropy dominates.

article,Josephson coupled Ising pairing induced in suspended MoS2 bilayers by double-side ionic gating,"<p>Superconductivity in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides is characterized by Ising-type pairing induced via a strong Zeeman-type spin&#8211;orbit coupling. When two transition metal dichalcogenides layers are coupled, more exotic superconducting phases emerge, which depend on the ratio of Ising-type protection and interlayer coupling strength. Here, we induce superconductivity in suspended MoS<sub>2</sub> bilayers and unveil a coupled superconducting state with strong Ising-type spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Gating the bilayer symmetrically from both sides by ionic liquid gating varies the interlayer interaction and accesses electronic states with broken local inversion symmetry while maintaining the global inversion symmetry. We observe a strong suppression of the Ising protection that evidences a coupled superconducting state. The symmetric gating scheme not only induces superconductivity in both atomic sheets but also controls the Josephson coupling between the layers, which gives rise to a dimensional crossover in the bilayer.</p>",[],False,"[""O.

article,Positive and negative chemotaxis of enzyme-coated liposome motors,"<p>The ability of cells or cell components to move in response to chemical signals is critical for the survival of living systems. This motion arises from harnessing free energy from enzymatic catalysis. Artificial model protocells derived from phospholipids and other amphiphiles have been made and their enzymatic-driven motion has been observed. However, control of directionality based on chemical cues (chemotaxis) has been difficult to achieve. Here we show both positive or negative chemotaxis of liposomal protocells. The protocells move autonomously by interacting with concentration gradients of either substrates or products in enzyme catalysis, or Hofmeister salts. We hypothesize that the propulsion mechanism is based on the interplay between enzyme-catalysis-induced positive chemotaxis and solute&#8211;phospholipid-based negative chemotaxis. Controlling the extent and direction of chemotaxis holds considerable potential for designing cell mimics and delivery vehicles that can reconfigure their motion in response to environmental conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Ambika Somasundar"", ""Subhadip Ghosh"", ""Farzad Mohajerani"", ""Lynnicia N.

article,Catalytic site-selective substrate processing within a tubular nanoreactor,"<p>Chemists have long sought the ability to modify molecules precisely when presented with several sites of similar reactivity. We reasoned that the confinement of substrates within nanostructures might permit site-selective reactions unachievable in bulk solution, even with sophisticated reagents. In particular, the stretching and alignment of polymers within nanotubes might allow site-specific cleavage or modification. To explore this proposition, macromolecular disulfide substrates were elongated within members of a collection of tubular protein nanoreactors, which contained cysteine residues positioned at different locations along the length of each tube. For each nanoreactor, we defined the reactive location by using a set of polymer substrates (site-selectivity) and which of the two sulfur atoms was attacked (regioselectivity), and found that disulfide interchange occurs with atomic precision. Our strategy has potential for the selective processing of a wide variety of biomacromolecules, and the chemistry and substrates might be generalized yet further by using alternative nanotubes.</p>",[],False,"[""Yujia Qing"", ""Hiroko Tamagaki-Asahina"", ""Sandra A.

Here, we describe a simple and robust antifouling coating for electrodes consisting of a three-dimensional porous matrix of cross-linked bovine serum albumin supported by a network of conductive nanomaterials composed of either gold nanowires, gold nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes.

article,A pH-responsive nanoparticle targets the neurokinin 1 receptor in endosomes to prevent chronic pain,"<p>Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is especially useful for targets within endosomes because of the endosomal transport mechanisms of many nanomedicines within cells. Here, we report the design of a pH-responsive, soft polymeric nanoparticle for the targeting of acidified endosomes to precisely inhibit endosomal signalling events leading to chronic pain. In chronic pain, the substance P (SP) neurokinin 1 receptor (NK<sub>1</sub>R) redistributes from the plasma membrane to acidified endosomes, where it signals to maintain pain. Therefore, the NK<sub>1</sub>R in endosomes provides an important target for pain relief. The pH-responsive nanoparticles enter cells by clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis and accumulate in NK<sub>1</sub>R-containing endosomes. Following intrathecal injection into rodents, the nanoparticles, containing the FDA-approved NK<sub>1</sub>R antagonist aprepitant, inhibit SP-induced activation of spinal neurons and thus prevent pain transmission. Treatment with the nanoparticles leads to complete and persistent relief from nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic nociception and offers a much-needed non-opioid treatment option for chronic pain.</p>",[],False,"[""Paulina D.

However, a NO-delivery system with a prolonged half-life and a sustained release mechanism is currently lacking. Here we report the development of NanoNO, a nanoscale carrier that enables sustained NO release to efficiently deliver NO into hepatocellular carcinoma. Low-dose NanoNO normalizes tumour vessels and improves the delivery and effectiveness of chemotherapeutics and tumour necrosis factor-related, apoptosis-inducing, ligand-based therapy in both primary tumours and metastases. Furthermore, low-dose NanoNO reprogrammes the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment toward an immunostimulatory phenotype, thereby improving the efficacy of cancer vaccine immunotherapy.
