letter,A silicon quantum-dot-coupled nuclear spin qubit,"<p>Single nuclear spins in the solid state are a potential future platform for quantum computing, because they possess long coherence times and offer excellent controllability. Measurements can be performed via localized electrons, such as those in single atom dopants or crystal defects. However, establishing long-range interactions between multiple dopants or defects is challenging. Conversely, in lithographically defined quantum dots, tunable interdot electron tunnelling allows direct coupling of electron spin-based qubits in neighbouring dots. Moreover, the compatibility with semiconductor fabrication techniques may allow for scaling to large numbers of qubits in the future. Unfortunately, hyperfine interactions are typically too weak to address single nuclei. Here we show that for electrons in silicon metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor quantum dots the hyperfine interaction is sufficient to initialize, read out and control single <sup>29</sup>Si nuclear spins. This approach combines the long coherence times of nuclear spins with the flexibility and scalability of quantum dot systems. We demonstrate high-fidelity projective readout and control of the nuclear spin qubit, as well as entanglement between the nuclear and electron spins. Crucially, we find that both the nuclear spin and electron spin retain their coherence while moving the electron between quantum dots. Hence we envision long-range nuclear&#8211;nuclear entanglement via electron shuttling. Our results establish nuclear spins in quantum dots as a powerful new resource for quantum processing.</p>",[],False,"[""Bas Hensen"", ""Wister Wei Huang"", ""Chih-Hwan Yang"", ""Kok Wai Chan"", ""Jun Yoneda"", ""Tuomo Tanttu"", ""Fay E.

letter,Reversible coordination-induced spin-state switching in complexes on metal surfaces,"<p>Molecular spin switches are attractive candidates for controlling the spin polarization developing at the interface between molecules and magnetic metal surfaces, which is relevant for molecular spintronics devices. However, so far, intrinsic spin switches such as spin-crossover complexes have suffered from fragmentation or loss of functionality following adsorption on metal surfaces, with rare exceptions. Robust metal&#8211;organic platforms, on the other hand, rely on external axial ligands to induce spin switching. Here we integrate a spin switching functionality into robust complexes, relying on the mechanical movement of an axial ligand strapped to the porphyrin ring. Reversible interlocked switching of spin and coordination, induced by electron injection, is demonstrated on Ag(111) for this class of compounds. The stability of the two spin and coordination states of the molecules exceeds days at 4&#8201;K. The potential applications of this switching concept go beyond the spin functionality, and may turn out to be useful for controlling the catalytic activity of surfaces.</p>",[],False,"[""Alexander K\u00f6bke"", ""Florian Gutzeit"", ""Fynn R\u00f6hricht"", ""Alexander Schlimm"", ""Jan Grunwald"", ""Felix Tuczek"", ""Micha\u0142 Studniarek"", ""Danilo Longo"", ""Fadi Choueikani"", ""Edwige Otero"", ""Philippe Ohresser"", ""Sebastian Rohlf"", ""Sven Johannsen"", ""Florian Diekmann"", ""Kai Rossnagel"", ""Alexander Weismann"", ""Torben Jasper-Toennies"", ""Christian N\u00e4ther"", ""Rainer Herges"", ""Richard Berndt"", ""Manuel Gruber""]","Köbke, A., Gutzeit, F., Röhricht, F. et al.

letter,Topological frustration induces unconventional magnetism in a nanographene,"<p>The chemical versatility of carbon imparts manifold properties to organic compounds, where magnetism remains one of the most desirable but elusive. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, also referred to as nanographenes, show a critical dependence of electronic structure on the topologies of the edges and the &#960;-electron network, which makes them model systems with which to engineer unconventional properties including magnetism. In 1972, Erich Clar envisioned a bow-tie-shaped nanographene, C<sub>38</sub>H<sub>18</sub> (refs. ), where topological frustration in the &#960;-electron network renders it impossible to assign a classical Kekul&#233; structure without leaving unpaired electrons, driving the system into a magnetically non-trivial ground state. Here, we report the experimental realization and in-depth characterization of this emblematic nanographene, known as Clar&#8217;s goblet. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and spin excitation spectroscopy of individual molecules on a gold surface reveal a robust antiferromagnetic order with an exchange-coupling strength of 23&#8201;meV, exceeding the Landauer limit of minimum energy dissipation at room temperature. Through atomic manipulation, we realize switching of magnetic ground states in molecules with quenched spins. Our results provide direct evidence of carbon magnetism in a hitherto unrealized class of nanographenes, and prove a long-predicted paradigm where topological frustration entails unconventional magnetism, with implications for room-temperature carbon-based spintronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Shantanu Mishra"", ""Doreen Beyer"", ""Kristjan Eimre"", ""Shawulienu Kezilebieke"", ""Reinhard Berger"", ""Oliver Gr\u00f6ning"", ""Carlo A.

letter,Substrate-directed synthesis of MoS2 nanocrystals with tunable dimensionality and optical properties,"<p>Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals are a versatile platform for optoelectronic, catalytic and quantum device studies. However, the ability to tailor their physical properties through explicit synthetic control of their morphology and dimensionality is a major challenge. Here we demonstrate a gas-phase synthesis method that substantially transforms the structure and dimensionality of TMD crystals without lithography. Synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub> on Si(001) surfaces pre-treated with phosphine yields high-aspect-ratio nanoribbons of uniform width. We systematically control the width of these nanoribbons between 50 and 430&#8201;nm by varying the total phosphine dosage during the surface treatment step. Aberration-corrected electron microscopy reveals that the nanoribbons are predominantly 2H phase with zig-zag edges and an edge quality that is comparable to, or better than, that of graphene and TMD nanoribbons prepared through conventional top-down processing. Owing to their restricted dimensionality, the nominally one-dimensional MoS<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals exhibit photoluminescence 50&#8201;meV higher in energy than that from two-dimensional MoS<sub>2</sub> crystals. Moreover, this emission is precisely tunable through synthetic control of crystal width. Directed crystal growth on designer substrates has the potential to enable the preparation of low-dimensional materials with prescribed morphologies and tunable or emergent optoelectronic properties.</p>",[],False,"[""Tomojit Chowdhury"", ""Jungkil Kim"", ""Erick C.

letter,Conductive polymer nanoantennas for dynamic organic plasmonics,"<p>Being able to dynamically shape light at the nanoscale is one of the ultimate goals in nano-optics. Resonant light&#8211;matter interaction can be achieved using conventional plasmonics based on metal nanostructures, but their tunability is highly limited due to a fixed permittivity. Materials with switchable states and methods for dynamic control of light&#8211;matter interaction at the nanoscale are therefore desired. Here we show that nanodisks of a conductive polymer can support localized surface plasmon resonances in the near-infrared and function as dynamic nano-optical antennas, with their resonance behaviour tunable by chemical redox reactions. These plasmons originate from the mobile polaronic charge carriers of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) (PEDOT:Sulf) polymer network. We demonstrate complete and reversible switching of the optical response of the nanoantennas by chemical tuning of their redox state, which modulates the material permittivity between plasmonic and dielectric regimes via non-volatile changes in the mobile charge carrier density. Further research may study different conductive polymers and nanostructures and explore their use in various applications, such as dynamic meta-optics and reflective displays.</p>",[],False,"[""Shangzhi Chen"", ""Evan S.

letter,Vitamin lipid nanoparticles enable adoptive macrophage transfer for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial sepsis,"<p>Sepsis, a condition caused by severe infections, affects more than 30 million people worldwide every year and remains the leading cause of death in hospitals. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance has become an additional challenge in the treatment of sepsis, and thus, alternative therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Here, we show that adoptive transfer of macrophages containing antimicrobial peptides linked to cathepsin B in the lysosomes (MACs) can be applied for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria-induced sepsis in mice with immunosuppression. The MACs are constructed by transfection of vitamin C lipid nanoparticles that deliver antimicrobial peptide and cathepsin B (AMP-CatB) mRNA. The vitamin C lipid nanoparticles allow the specific accumulation of AMP-CatB in macrophage lysosomes, which is the key location for bactericidal activities. Our results demonstrate that adoptive MAC transfer leads to the elimination of multidrug-resistant bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, leading to the complete recovery of immunocompromised septic mice. Our work provides an alternative strategy for overcoming multidrug-resistant bacteria-induced sepsis and opens up possibilities for the development of nanoparticle-enabled cell therapy for infectious diseases.</p>",[],False,"[""Xucheng Hou"", ""Xinfu Zhang"", ""Weiyu Zhao"", ""Chunxi Zeng"", ""Binbin Deng"", ""David W.

article,Two-dimensional mutually synchronized spin Hall nano-oscillator arrays for neuromorphic computing,"<p>In spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs), pure spin currents drive local regions of magnetic films and nanostructures into auto-oscillating precession. If such regions are placed in close proximity to each other they can interact and may mutually synchronize. Here, we demonstrate robust mutual synchronization of two-dimensional SHNO arrays ranging from 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2 to 8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;8 nano-constrictions, observed both electrically and using micro-Brillouin light scattering microscopy. On short time scales, where the auto-oscillation linewidth \(\Delta f\) is governed by white noise, the signal quality factor, \(Q=f/\Delta f\), increases linearly with the number of mutually synchronized nano-constrictions (N), reaching 170,000 in the largest arrays. We also show that SHNO arrays exposed to two independently tuned microwave frequencies exhibit the same synchronization maps as can be used for neuromorphic vowel recognition.

article,A high-performance topological bulk laser based on band-inversion-induced reflection,"<p>Topological insulators are materials that behave as insulators in the bulk and as conductors at the edge or surface due to the particular configuration of their bulk band dispersion. However, up to date possible practical applications of this band topology on materials&#8217; bulk properties have remained abstract. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a topological bulk laser. We pattern semiconductor nanodisk arrays to form a photonic crystal cavity showing topological band inversion between its interior and cladding area. In-plane light waves are reflected at topological edges forming an effective cavity feedback for lasing. This band-inversion-induced reflection mechanism induces single-mode lasing with directional vertical emission. Our topological bulk laser works at room temperature and reaches the practical requirements in terms of cavity size, threshold, linewidth, side-mode suppression ratio and directionality for most practical applications according to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and other industry standards.
