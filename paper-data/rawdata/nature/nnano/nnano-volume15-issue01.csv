letter,A silicon quantum-dot-coupled nuclear spin qubit,"<p>Single nuclear spins in the solid state are a potential future platform for quantum computing, because they possess long coherence times and offer excellent controllability. Measurements can be performed via localized electrons, such as those in single atom dopants or crystal defects. However, establishing long-range interactions between multiple dopants or defects is challenging. Conversely, in lithographically defined quantum dots, tunable interdot electron tunnelling allows direct coupling of electron spin-based qubits in neighbouring dots. Moreover, the compatibility with semiconductor fabrication techniques may allow for scaling to large numbers of qubits in the future. Unfortunately, hyperfine interactions are typically too weak to address single nuclei. Here we show that for electrons in silicon metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor quantum dots the hyperfine interaction is sufficient to initialize, read out and control single <sup>29</sup>Si nuclear spins. This approach combines the long coherence times of nuclear spins with the flexibility and scalability of quantum dot systems. We demonstrate high-fidelity projective readout and control of the nuclear spin qubit, as well as entanglement between the nuclear and electron spins. Crucially, we find that both the nuclear spin and electron spin retain their coherence while moving the electron between quantum dots. Hence we envision long-range nuclear&#8211;nuclear entanglement via electron shuttling. Our results establish nuclear spins in quantum dots as a powerful new resource for quantum processing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia', 'authors': ['Bas Hensen', ',\xa0Wister Wei Huang', ',\xa0Chih-Hwan Yang', ',\xa0Kok Wai Chan', ',\xa0Jun Yoneda', ',\xa0Tuomo Tanttu', ',\xa0Fay E.

letter,Reversible coordination-induced spin-state switching in complexes on metal surfaces,"<p>Molecular spin switches are attractive candidates for controlling the spin polarization developing at the interface between molecules and magnetic metal surfaces, which is relevant for molecular spintronics devices. However, so far, intrinsic spin switches such as spin-crossover complexes have suffered from fragmentation or loss of functionality following adsorption on metal surfaces, with rare exceptions. Robust metal&#8211;organic platforms, on the other hand, rely on external axial ligands to induce spin switching. Here we integrate a spin switching functionality into robust complexes, relying on the mechanical movement of an axial ligand strapped to the porphyrin ring. Reversible interlocked switching of spin and coordination, induced by electron injection, is demonstrated on Ag(111) for this class of compounds. The stability of the two spin and coordination states of the molecules exceeds days at 4&#8201;K. The potential applications of this switching concept go beyond the spin functionality, and may turn out to be useful for controlling the catalytic activity of surfaces.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut für Experimentelle und Angewandte Physik, Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Kiel, Germany', 'authors': ['Alexander Köbke', ',\xa0Sebastian Rohlf', ',\xa0Sven Johannsen', ',\xa0Florian Diekmann', ',\xa0Kai Rossnagel', ',\xa0Alexander Weismann', ',\xa0Torben Jasper-Toennies', ',\xa0Richard Berndt', '\xa0&\xa0Manuel Gruber']}, {'address': 'Otto-Diels-Institut für Organische Chemie, Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Kiel, Germany', 'authors': ['Florian Gutzeit', ',\xa0Fynn Röhricht', '\xa0&\xa0Rainer Herges']}, {'address': 'Institut für Anorganische Chemie, Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Kiel, Germany', 'authors': ['Alexander Schlimm', ',\xa0Jan Grunwald', ',\xa0Felix Tuczek', '\xa0&\xa0Christian Näther']}, {'address': 'Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Michał Studniarek']}, {'address': 'Synchrotron SOLEIL, L’Orme des Merisiers, Gif-sur-Yvette, France', 'authors': ['Danilo Longo', ',\xa0Fadi Choueikani', ',\xa0Edwige Otero', '\xa0&\xa0Philippe Ohresser']}, {'address': 'Ruprecht-Haensel-Labor, Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel und Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Hamburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Sebastian Rohlf', ',\xa0Florian Diekmann', '\xa0&\xa0Kai Rossnagel']}, {'address': 'Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Hamburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Kai Rossnagel']}]",False,"['Alexander Köbke', 'Florian Gutzeit', 'Fynn Röhricht', 'Alexander Schlimm', 'Jan Grunwald', 'Felix Tuczek', 'Michał Studniarek', 'Danilo Longo', 'Fadi Choueikani', 'Edwige Otero', 'Philippe Ohresser', 'Sebastian Rohlf', 'Sven Johannsen', 'Florian Diekmann', 'Kai Rossnagel', 'Alexander Weismann', 'Torben Jasper-Toennies', 'Christian Näther', 'Rainer Herges', 'Richard Berndt', 'Manuel Gruber']","Köbke, A., Gutzeit, F., Röhricht, F. et al.

letter,Topological frustration induces unconventional magnetism in a nanographene,"<p>The chemical versatility of carbon imparts manifold properties to organic compounds, where magnetism remains one of the most desirable but elusive. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, also referred to as nanographenes, show a critical dependence of electronic structure on the topologies of the edges and the &#960;-electron network, which makes them model systems with which to engineer unconventional properties including magnetism. In 1972, Erich Clar envisioned a bow-tie-shaped nanographene, C<sub>38</sub>H<sub>18</sub> (refs. ), where topological frustration in the &#960;-electron network renders it impossible to assign a classical Kekul&#233; structure without leaving unpaired electrons, driving the system into a magnetically non-trivial ground state. Here, we report the experimental realization and in-depth characterization of this emblematic nanographene, known as Clar&#8217;s goblet. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and spin excitation spectroscopy of individual molecules on a gold surface reveal a robust antiferromagnetic order with an exchange-coupling strength of 23&#8201;meV, exceeding the Landauer limit of minimum energy dissipation at room temperature. Through atomic manipulation, we realize switching of magnetic ground states in molecules with quenched spins. Our results provide direct evidence of carbon magnetism in a hitherto unrealized class of nanographenes, and prove a long-predicted paradigm where topological frustration entails unconventional magnetism, with implications for room-temperature carbon-based spintronics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'nanotech@surfaces Laboratory, Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Dübendorf, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Shantanu Mishra', ',\xa0Kristjan Eimre', ',\xa0Oliver Gröning', ',\xa0Carlo A.

letter,Substrate-directed synthesis of MoS2 nanocrystals with tunable dimensionality and optical properties,"<p>Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals are a versatile platform for optoelectronic, catalytic and quantum device studies. However, the ability to tailor their physical properties through explicit synthetic control of their morphology and dimensionality is a major challenge. Here we demonstrate a gas-phase synthesis method that substantially transforms the structure and dimensionality of TMD crystals without lithography. Synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub> on Si(001) surfaces pre-treated with phosphine yields high-aspect-ratio nanoribbons of uniform width. We systematically control the width of these nanoribbons between 50 and 430&#8201;nm by varying the total phosphine dosage during the surface treatment step. Aberration-corrected electron microscopy reveals that the nanoribbons are predominantly 2H phase with zig-zag edges and an edge quality that is comparable to, or better than, that of graphene and TMD nanoribbons prepared through conventional top-down processing. Owing to their restricted dimensionality, the nominally one-dimensional MoS<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals exhibit photoluminescence 50&#8201;meV higher in energy than that from two-dimensional MoS<sub>2</sub> crystals. Moreover, this emission is precisely tunable through synthetic control of crystal width. Directed crystal growth on designer substrates has the potential to enable the preparation of low-dimensional materials with prescribed morphologies and tunable or emergent optoelectronic properties.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA', 'authors': ['Tomojit Chowdhury', ',\xa0Jungkil Kim', ',\xa0Erick C.

letter,Conductive polymer nanoantennas for dynamic organic plasmonics,"<p>Being able to dynamically shape light at the nanoscale is one of the ultimate goals in nano-optics. Resonant light&#8211;matter interaction can be achieved using conventional plasmonics based on metal nanostructures, but their tunability is highly limited due to a fixed permittivity. Materials with switchable states and methods for dynamic control of light&#8211;matter interaction at the nanoscale are therefore desired. Here we show that nanodisks of a conductive polymer can support localized surface plasmon resonances in the near-infrared and function as dynamic nano-optical antennas, with their resonance behaviour tunable by chemical redox reactions. These plasmons originate from the mobile polaronic charge carriers of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) (PEDOT:Sulf) polymer network. We demonstrate complete and reversible switching of the optical response of the nanoantennas by chemical tuning of their redox state, which modulates the material permittivity between plasmonic and dielectric regimes via non-volatile changes in the mobile charge carrier density. Further research may study different conductive polymers and nanostructures and explore their use in various applications, such as dynamic meta-optics and reflective displays.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory of Organic Electronics, Department of Science and Technology (ITN), Linköping University, Norrköping, Sweden', 'authors': ['Shangzhi Chen', ',\xa0Evan S.

letter,Vitamin lipid nanoparticles enable adoptive macrophage transfer for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial sepsis,"<p>Sepsis, a condition caused by severe infections, affects more than 30 million people worldwide every year and remains the leading cause of death in hospitals. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance has become an additional challenge in the treatment of sepsis, and thus, alternative therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Here, we show that adoptive transfer of macrophages containing antimicrobial peptides linked to cathepsin B in the lysosomes (MACs) can be applied for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria-induced sepsis in mice with immunosuppression. The MACs are constructed by transfection of vitamin C lipid nanoparticles that deliver antimicrobial peptide and cathepsin B (AMP-CatB) mRNA. The vitamin C lipid nanoparticles allow the specific accumulation of AMP-CatB in macrophage lysosomes, which is the key location for bactericidal activities. Our results demonstrate that adoptive MAC transfer leads to the elimination of multidrug-resistant bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, leading to the complete recovery of immunocompromised septic mice. Our work provides an alternative strategy for overcoming multidrug-resistant bacteria-induced sepsis and opens up possibilities for the development of nanoparticle-enabled cell therapy for infectious diseases.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Pharmaceutics & Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA', 'authors': ['Xucheng Hou', ',\xa0Xinfu Zhang', ',\xa0Weiyu Zhao', ',\xa0Chunxi Zeng', ',\xa0Shi Du', ',\xa0Chengxiang Zhang', ',\xa0Wenqing Li', '\xa0&\xa0Yizhou Dong']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China', 'authors': ['Xinfu Zhang']}, {'address': 'Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA', 'authors': ['Binbin Deng', '\xa0&\xa0David W.

article,Two-dimensional mutually synchronized spin Hall nano-oscillator arrays for neuromorphic computing,"<p>In spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs), pure spin currents drive local regions of magnetic films and nanostructures into auto-oscillating precession. If such regions are placed in close proximity to each other they can interact and may mutually synchronize. Here, we demonstrate robust mutual synchronization of two-dimensional SHNO arrays ranging from 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;2 to 8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;8 nano-constrictions, observed both electrically and using micro-Brillouin light scattering microscopy. On short time scales, where the auto-oscillation linewidth \(\Delta f\) is governed by white noise, the signal quality factor, \(Q=f/\Delta f\), increases linearly with the number of mutually synchronized nano-constrictions (N), reaching 170,000 in the largest arrays. We also show that SHNO arrays exposed to two independently tuned microwave frequencies exhibit the same synchronization maps as can be used for neuromorphic vowel recognition. Our demonstrations may hence enable the use of SHNO arrays in two-dimensional oscillator networks for high-quality microwave signal generation and ultra-fast neuromorphic computing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics Department, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden', 'authors': ['Mohammad Zahedinejad', ',\xa0Ahmad A.

article,Evaporated tellurium thin films for p-type field-effect transistors and circuits,"<p>There is an emerging need for semiconductors that can be processed at near ambient temperature with high mobility and device performance. Although multiple n-type options have been identified, the development of their p-type counterparts remains limited. Here, we report the realization of tellurium thin films through thermal evaporation at cryogenic temperatures for fabrication of high-performance wafer-scale p-type field-effect transistors. We achieve an effective hole mobility of ~35&#8201;cm<sup>2&#8201;</sup>V<sup>&#8722;1&#8201;</sup>s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, on/off current ratio of ~10<sup>4</sup> and subthreshold swing of 108&#8201;mV&#8201;dec<sup>&#8722;1</sup> on an 8-nm-thick film. High-performance tellurium p-type field-effect transistors are fabricated on a wide range of substrates including glass and plastic, further demonstrating the broad applicability of this material. Significantly, three-dimensional circuits are demonstrated by integrating multi-layered transistors on a single chip using sequential lithography, deposition and lift-off processes. Finally, various functional logic gates and circuits are demonstrated.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Chunsong Zhao', ',\xa0Chaoliang Tan', ',\xa0Der-Hsien Lien', ',\xa0Matin Amani', ',\xa0Mark Hettick', ',\xa0Hnin Yin Yin Nyein', ',\xa0Zhen Yuan', ',\xa0Lu Li', '\xa0&\xa0Ali Javey']}, {'address': 'Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Chunsong Zhao', ',\xa0Chaoliang Tan', ',\xa0Der-Hsien Lien', ',\xa0Matin Amani', ',\xa0Mark Hettick', ',\xa0Hnin Yin Yin Nyein', ',\xa0Zhen Yuan', ',\xa0Lu Li', '\xa0&\xa0Ali Javey']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Chunsong Zhao', ',\xa0Xiaohui Song', ',\xa0Hnin Yin Yin Nyein', '\xa0&\xa0Mary C.

article,Chemically induced transformation of chemical vapour deposition grown bilayer graphene into fluorinated single-layer diamond,"<p>Notwithstanding the numerous density functional studies on the chemically induced transformation of multilayer graphene into a diamond-like film carried out to date, a comprehensive convincing experimental proof of such a conversion is still lacking. We show that the fluorination of graphene sheets in Bernal (AB)-stacked bilayer graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition on a single-crystal CuNi(111) surface triggers the formation of interlayer carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, resulting in a fluorinated diamond monolayer (&#8216;F-diamane&#8217;). Induced by fluorine chemisorption, the phase transition from (AB)-stacked bilayer graphene to single-layer diamond was studied and verified by X-ray photoelectron, UV photoelectron, Raman, UV-Vis and electron energy loss spectroscopies, transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Multidimensional Carbon Materials (CMCM), Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Ulsan, Republic of Korea', 'authors': ['Pavel V.

article,A high-performance topological bulk laser based on band-inversion-induced reflection,"<p>Topological insulators are materials that behave as insulators in the bulk and as conductors at the edge or surface due to the particular configuration of their bulk band dispersion. However, up to date possible practical applications of this band topology on materials&#8217; bulk properties have remained abstract. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a topological bulk laser. We pattern semiconductor nanodisk arrays to form a photonic crystal cavity showing topological band inversion between its interior and cladding area. In-plane light waves are reflected at topological edges forming an effective cavity feedback for lasing. This band-inversion-induced reflection mechanism induces single-mode lasing with directional vertical emission. Our topological bulk laser works at room temperature and reaches the practical requirements in terms of cavity size, threshold, linewidth, side-mode suppression ratio and directionality for most practical applications according to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and other industry standards. We believe this bulk topological effect will have applications in near-field spectroscopy, solid-state lighting, free-space optical sensing and communication.</p>",,"[{'address': 'State Key Lab for Mesoscopic Physics and School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Zeng-Kai Shao', ',\xa0Hua-Zhou Chen', ',\xa0Suo Wang', ',\xa0Xin-Rui Mao', ',\xa0Zhen-Qian Yang', ',\xa0Shao-Lei Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Ren-Min Ma']}, {'address': 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Zeng-Kai Shao', ',\xa0Hua-Zhou Chen', ',\xa0Suo Wang', ',\xa0Xin-Rui Mao', ',\xa0Zhen-Qian Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Ren-Min Ma']}, {'address': 'Frontiers Science Center for Nano-optoelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Zeng-Kai Shao', ',\xa0Hua-Zhou Chen', ',\xa0Suo Wang', ',\xa0Xin-Rui Mao', ',\xa0Zhen-Qian Yang', '\xa0&\xa0Ren-Min Ma']}, {'address': 'International Center for Materials Nanarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, Japan', 'authors': ['Xing-Xiang Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Xiao Hu']}, {'address': 'Graduate school of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan', 'authors': ['Xing-Xiang Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Xiao Hu']}]",False,"['Zeng-Kai Shao', 'Hua-Zhou Chen', 'Suo Wang', 'Xin-Rui Mao', 'Zhen-Qian Yang', 'Shao-Lei Wang', 'Xing-Xiang Wang', 'Xiao Hu', 'Ren-Min Ma']","Shao, Z., Chen, H., Wang, S. et al.A high-performance topological bulk laser based on band-inversion-induced reflection.

article,Artificial water channels enable fast and selective water permeation through water-wire networks,"<p>Artificial water channels are synthetic molecules that aim to mimic the structural and functional features of biological water channels (aquaporins). Here we report on a cluster-forming organic nanoarchitecture, peptide-appended hybrid[4]arene (PAH[4]), as a new class of artificial water channels. Fluorescence experiments and simulations demonstrated that PAH[4]s can form, through lateral diffusion, clusters in lipid membranes that provide synergistic membrane-spanning paths for a rapid and selective water permeation through water-wire networks. Quantitative transport studies revealed that PAH[4]s can transport &gt;10<sup>9</sup> water molecules per second per molecule, which is comparable to aquaporin water channels. The performance of these channels exceeds the upper bound limit of current desalination membranes by a factor of ~10<sup>4</sup>, as illustrated by the water/NaCl permeability&#8211;selectivity trade-off curve. PAH[4]&#8217;s unique properties of a high water/solute permselectivity via cooperative water-wire formation could usher in an alternative design paradigm for permeable membrane materials in separations, energy production and barrier applications.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA', 'authors': ['Woochul Song', ',\xa0Ratul Chowdhury', ',\xa0Chao Lang', ',\xa0Yu-Ming Tu', ',\xa0Megan Farell', ',\xa0Costas D.
