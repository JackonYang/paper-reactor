letter,Ultrasensitive torque detection with an optically levitated nanorotor,"<p>Torque sensors such as the torsion balance enabled the first determination of the gravitational constant by Henri Cavendish and the discovery of Coulomb&#8217;s law. Torque sensors are also widely used in studying small-scale magnetism, the Casimir effect and other applications. Great effort has been made to improve the torque detection sensitivity by nanofabrication and cryogenic cooling. Until now, the most sensitive torque sensor has achieved a remarkable sensitivity of 2.9&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;24</sup>&#8201;N&#8201;m&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> at millikelvin temperatures in a dilution refrigerator.

It is created by an optically levitated nanoparticle in vacuum. Our system does not require complex nanofabrication. Moreover, we drive a nanoparticle to rotate at a record high speed beyond 5&#8201;GHz (300 billion&#8201;r.p.m.). Our calculations show that this system will be able to detect the long sought after vacuum friction near a surface under realistic conditions.

letter,Lithium whisker growth and stress generation in an in situ atomic force microscope–environmental transmission electron microscope set-up,"<p>Lithium metal is considered the ultimate anode material for future rechargeable batteries, but the development of Li metal-based rechargeable batteries has achieved only limited success due to uncontrollable Li dendrite growth. In a broad class of all-solid-state Li batteries, one approach to suppress Li dendrite growth has been the use of mechanically stiff solid electrolytes. However, Li dendrites still grow through them. Resolving this issue requires a fundamental understanding of the growth and associated electro-chemo-mechanical behaviour of Li dendrites. Here, we report in situ growth observation and stress measurement of individual Li whiskers, the primary Li dendrite morphologies. We combine an atomic force microscope with an environmental transmission electron microscope in a novel experimental set-up. At room temperature, a submicrometre whisker grows under an applied voltage (overpotential) against the atomic force microscope tip, generating a growth stress up to 130&#8201;MPa; this value is substantially higher than the stresses previously reported for bulk and micrometre-sized Li. The measured yield strength of Li whiskers under pure mechanical loading reaches as high as 244&#8201;MPa. Our results provide quantitative benchmarks for the design of Li dendrite growth suppression strategies in all-solid-state batteries.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Clean Nano Energy Center, State Key Laboratory of Metastable Materials Science and Technology, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China', 'authors': ['Liqiang Zhang', ',\xa0Tingting Yang', ',\xa0Congcong Du', ',\xa0Qiunan Liu', ',\xa0Jun Zhao', ',\xa0Yong Sun', ',\xa0Peng Jia', ',\xa0Hui Li', ',\xa0Lin Geng', ',\xa0Jingzhao Chen', ',\xa0Hongjun Ye', ',\xa0Zaifa Wang', ',\xa0Yanshuai Li', ',\xa0Haiming Sun', ',\xa0Xiaomei Li', ',\xa0Qiushi Dai', ',\xa0Yongfu Tang', ',\xa0Qiuming Peng', ',\xa0Tongde Shen', '\xa0&\xa0Jianyu Huang']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing, China University of Petroleum Beijing, Beijing, China', 'authors': ['Liqiang Zhang', '\xa0&\xa0Yushu Tang']}, {'address': 'Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA', 'authors': ['Baolin Wang', '\xa0&\xa0Ting Zhu']}, {'address': 'Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA', 'authors': ['Tianwu Chen', '\xa0&\xa0Sulin Zhang']}, {'address': 'Key Laboratory of Low Dimensional Materials and Application Technology of Ministry of Education, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China', 'authors': ['Jianyu Huang']}]",False,"['Liqiang Zhang', 'Tingting Yang', 'Congcong Du', 'Qiunan Liu', 'Yushu Tang', 'Jun Zhao', 'Baolin Wang', 'Tianwu Chen', 'Yong Sun', 'Peng Jia', 'Hui Li', 'Lin Geng', 'Jingzhao Chen', 'Hongjun Ye', 'Zaifa Wang', 'Yanshuai Li', 'Haiming Sun', 'Xiaomei Li', 'Qiushi Dai', 'Yongfu Tang', 'Qiuming Peng', 'Tongde Shen', 'Sulin Zhang', 'Ting Zhu', 'Jianyu Huang']","Zhang, L., Yang, T., Du, C. et al.

article,Nanoscale radiative thermal switching via multi-body effects,"<p>Control of thermal transport at the nanoscale is of great current interest for creating novel thermal logic and energy conversion devices. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that radiative heat transfer between macroscopic objects separated by nanogaps, or between nanostructures located in the far-field of each other, can exceed the blackbody limit. Here, we show that the radiative heat transfer between two coplanar SiN membranes can be modulated by factors as large as five by bringing a third planar object into close proximity of the membranes. Numerical modelling reveals that this modulation is due to a modification of guided modes (supported in the SiN nanomembranes) by evanescent interactions with the third object. This multi-body effect could offer an efficient pathway for active control of heat currents at the nanoscale.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA', 'authors': ['Dakotah Thompson', ',\xa0Linxiao Zhu', ',\xa0Edgar Meyhofer', '\xa0&\xa0Pramod Reddy']}, {'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA', 'authors': ['Pramod Reddy']}]",False,"['Dakotah Thompson', 'Linxiao Zhu', 'Edgar Meyhofer', 'Pramod Reddy']","Thompson, D., Zhu, L., Meyhofer, E. et al.

article,Single-molecule resonance Raman effect in a plasmonic nanocavity,"<p>Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a versatile tool for chemical analysis at the nanoscale. In earlier TERS experiments, Raman modes with components parallel to the tip were studied based on the strong electric field enhancement along the tip. Perpendicular modes were usually neglected. Here, we investigate an isolated copper naphthalocyanine molecule adsorbed on a triple-layer NaCl on Ag(111) using scanning tunnelling microscope TERS imaging. For flat-lying molecules on NaCl, the Raman images present different patterns depending on the symmetry of the vibrational mode. Our results reveal that components of the electric field perpendicular to the tip should be considered aside from the parallel components. Moreover, under resonance excitation conditions, the perpendicular components can play a substantial role in the enhancement. This single-molecule study in a well-defined environment provides insights into the Raman process at the plasmonic nanocavity, which may be useful in the nanoscale metrology of various molecular systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Surface and Interface Science Laboratory, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama, Japan', 'authors': ['Rafael B.

article,Single-shot dynamics of spin–orbit torque and spin transfer torque switching in three-terminal magnetic tunnel junctions,"<p>Current-induced spin-transfer torques (STT) and spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOT) enable the electrical switching of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in non-volatile magnetic random access memories. To develop faster memory devices, an improvement in the timescales that underlie the current-driven magnetization dynamics is required. Here we report all-electrical time-resolved measurements of magnetization reversal driven by SOT in a three-terminal MTJ device. Single-shot measurements of the MTJ resistance during current injection reveal that SOT switching involves a stochastic two-step process that consists of a domain nucleation time and propagation time, which have different genesis, timescales and statistical distributions compared to STT switching. We further show that the combination of SOT, STT and the voltage control of magnetic anisotropy leads to reproducible subnanosecond switching with the spread of the cumulative switching time smaller than 0.2&#8201;ns. Our measurements unravel the combined impact of SOT, STT and the voltage control of magnetic anisotropy in determining the switching speed and efficiency of MTJ devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials, ETH Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Eva Grimaldi', ',\xa0Viola Krizakova', ',\xa0Giacomo Sala', '\xa0&\xa0Pietro Gambardella']}, {'address': 'imec, Leuven, Belgium', 'authors': ['Farrukh Yasin', ',\xa0Sébastien Couet', ',\xa0Gouri Sankar Kar', '\xa0&\xa0Kevin Garello']}]",False,"['Eva Grimaldi', 'Viola Krizakova', 'Giacomo Sala', 'Farrukh Yasin', 'Sébastien Couet', 'Gouri Sankar Kar', 'Kevin Garello', 'Pietro Gambardella']","Grimaldi, E., Krizakova, V., Sala, G. et al.

article,Waveguide-integrated van der Waals heterostructure photodetector at telecom wavelengths with high speed and high responsivity,"<p>Intensive efforts have been devoted to the exploration of new optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) owing to their strong light&#8211;matter interaction and distinctive material properties. In particular, photodetectors featuring both high-speed and high-responsivity performance are of great interest for a vast number of applications such as high-data-rate interconnects operated at standardized telecom wavelengths. Yet, the intrinsically small carrier mobilities of TMDCs become a bottleneck for high-speed application use. Here, we present high-performance vertical van der Waals heterostructure-based photodetectors integrated on a silicon photonics platform. Our vertical MoTe<sub>2</sub>&#8211;graphene heterostructure design minimizes the carrier transit path length in TMDCs and enables a record-high measured bandwidth of at least 24&#8201;GHz under a moderate bias voltage of &#8211;3&#8201;V. Applying a higher bias or employing thinner MoTe<sub>2</sub> flakes boosts the bandwidth even to 50&#8201;GHz. Simultaneously, our device reaches a high external responsivity of 0.2&#8201;A&#8201;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup> for incident light at 1,300&#8201;nm, benefiting from the integrated waveguide design. Our studies shed light on performance trade-offs and present design guidelines for fast and efficient devices.

article,Metasurface-integrated vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers for programmable directional lasing emissions,"<p>Vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) have made indispensable contributions to the development of modern optoelectronic technologies. However, arbitrary beam shaping of VCSELs within a compact system has remained inaccessible until now. The emerging ultra-thin flat optical structures, namely metasurfaces, offer a powerful technique to manipulate electromagnetic fields with subwavelength spatial resolution. Here, we show that the monolithic integration of dielectric metasurfaces with VCSELs enables remarkable arbitrary control of the laser beam profiles, including self-collimation, Bessel and Vortex lasers, with high efficiency. Such wafer-level integration of metasurface through VCSEL-compatible technology simplifies the assembling process and preserves the high performance of the VCSELs.

Here, we report a design principle for the creation of a selective yet robust catalytic interface for heterogeneous electrocatalysts in the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>2</sub> oxygenates, demonstrated by rational tuning of an assembly of nitrogen-doped nanodiamonds and copper nanoparticles. The catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of ~63% towards C<sub>2</sub> oxygenates at applied potentials of only &#8722;0.5&#8201;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, this catalyst shows an unprecedented persistent catalytic performance up to 120&#8201;h, with steady current and only 19% activity decay. Density functional theory calculations show that CO binding is strengthened at the copper/nanodiamond interface, suppressing CO desorption and promoting C<sub>2</sub> production by lowering the apparent barrier for CO dimerization.

article,A highly reflective biogenic photonic material from core–shell birefringent nanoparticles,"<p>Spectacular natural optical phenomena are produced by highly reflective assemblies of organic crystals. Here we show how the tapetum reflector in a shrimp eye is constructed from arrays of spherical isoxanthopterin nanoparticles and relate the particle properties to their optical function. The nanoparticles are composed of single-crystal isoxanthopterin nanoplates arranged in concentric lamellae around a hollow core. The spherulitic birefringence of the nanoparticles, which originates from the radial alignment of the plates, results in a significant enhancement of the back-scattering. This enables the organism to maximize the reflectivity of the ultrathin tapetum, which functions to increase the eye&#8217;s sensitivity and preserve visual acuity. The particle size, core/shell ratio and packing are also controlled to optimize the intensity and spectral properties of the tapetum back-scattering.

article,Transformable peptide nanoparticles arrest HER2 signalling and cause cancer cell death in vivo,"<p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor&#8201;2 (HER2) is overexpressed in &gt;20% of breast cancers. Dimerization of HER2 receptors leads to the activation of downstream signals enabling the proliferation and survival of malignant phenotypes. Owing to the high expression levels of HER2, combination therapies are currently required for the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. Here, we designed non-toxic transformable peptides that self-assemble into micelles under aqueous conditions but, on binding to HER2 on cancer cells, transform into nanofibrils that disrupt HER2 dimerization and subsequent downstream signalling events leading to apoptosis of cancer cells. The phase transformation of peptides enables specific HER2 targeting, and inhibition of HER2 dimerization blocks the expression of proliferation and survival genes in the nucleus. We demonstrate, in mouse xenofraft models, that these transformable peptides can be used as a monotherapy in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, UC Davis NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Lu Zhang', ',\xa0Di Jing', ',\xa0Tatu Rojalin', ',\xa0Christopher M.

article,Pro-efferocytic nanoparticles are specifically taken up by lesional macrophages and prevent atherosclerosis,"<p>Atherosclerosis is the process that underlies heart attack and stroke. A characteristic feature of the atherosclerotic plaque is the accumulation of apoptotic cells in the necrotic core. Prophagocytic antibody-based therapies are currently being explored to stimulate the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells; however, these therapies can cause off-target clearance of healthy tissues, which leads to toxicities such as anaemia. Here we developed a macrophage-specific nanotherapy based on single-walled carbon nanotubes loaded with a chemical inhibitor of the antiphagocytic CD47-SIRP&#945; signalling axis. We demonstrate that these single-walled carbon nanotubes accumulate within the atherosclerotic plaque, reactivate lesional phagocytosis and reduce the plaque burden in atheroprone apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice without compromising safety, and thereby overcome a key translational barrier for this class of drugs. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that prophagocytic single-walled carbon nanotubes decrease the expression of inflammatory genes linked to cytokine and chemokine pathways in lesional macrophages, which demonstrates the potential of &#8216;Trojan horse&#8217; nanoparticles to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Surgery, Division of Vascular Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Alyssa M.
