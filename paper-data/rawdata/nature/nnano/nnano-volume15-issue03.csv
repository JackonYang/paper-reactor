review article,From nanoscale interface characterization to sustainable energy storage using all-solid-state batteries,"<p>The recent discovery of highly conductive solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) has led to tremendous progress in the development of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Though promising, they still face barriers that limit their practical application, such as poor interfacial stability, scalability challenges and production safety. Additionally, efforts to develop sustainable manufacturing of lithium ion batteries are still lacking, with no prevailing strategy developed yet to handle recyclability of ASSBs. To date, most SSE research has been largely focused on the discovery of novel electrolytes. Recent review articles have extensively examined a broad spectrum of these SSEs using evaluation factors such as conductivity and chemical stability. Recognizing this, in this Review we seek to evaluate SSEs beyond conventional factors and offer a perspective on various bulk, interface and nanoscale phenomena that require urgent attention within the scientific community. We provide a realistic assessment of the current state-of-the-art characterization techniques and evaluate future full cell ASSB prototyping strategies. We hope to offer rational solutions to overcome some major fundamental obstacles faced by the ASSB community, as well as potential strategies toward a sustainable ASSB recycling model.</p>",[],False,"[""Darren H.

letter,Controlled transformation of skyrmions and antiskyrmions in a non-centrosymmetric magnet,"<p>Control of topological spin textures in magnetic systems may enable future spintronic applications. Magnetic field pulses can switch the vortex polarity or the winding number of magnetic bubbles. Thermal energy can reverse the helicity of skyrmions and induce the transformation between meron and skyrmion by modifying the in-plane anisotropy. Among the various topological spin textures, skyrmions and antiskyrmions are nanometric spin-whirling structures carrying integer topological charges (N) of &#8722;1 and +1 (refs. ), respectively, and can be observed in real space. They exhibit different dynamical properties under current flow, for example, opposite signs for the topological Hall effect. Here we observe, in real space, transformations among antiskyrmions, non-topological (NT) bubbles and skyrmions (with N of +1, 0 and &#8722;1, respectively) and their lattices in a non-centrosymmetric Heusler magnet, Mn<sub>1.4</sub>Pt<sub>0.9</sub>Pd<sub>0.1</sub>Sn, with D<sub>2d</sub> symmetry. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy images under out-of-plane magnetic fields show a square lattice of square-shaped antiskyrmions near the Curie temperature and a triangular lattice of elliptically deformed skyrmions with opposite helicities at lower temperatures. The clockwise and counter-clockwise helicities of the skyrmions originate from Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions with opposite signs along the [100] and [010] directions, respectively. A variation of the in-plane magnetic field induces a topological transformation from antiskyrmions to NT-bubbles and to skyrmions, which is accompanied by a change of the lattice geometry. We also demonstrate control of the helicity of skyrmions by variations of the in-plane magnetic field.

letter,Layer-resolved magnetic proximity effect in van der Waals heterostructures,"<p>Magnetic proximity effects are integral to manipulating spintronic, superconducting, excitonic and topological phenomena in heterostructures. These effects are highly sensitive to the interfacial electronic properties, such as electron wavefunction overlap and band alignment. The recent emergence of magnetic two-dimensional materials opens new possibilities for exploring proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures. In particular, atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub> exhibits layered antiferromagnetism, in which adjacent ferromagnetic monolayers are antiferromagnetically coupled. Here we report a layer-resolved magnetic proximity effect in heterostructures formed by monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> and bi/trilayer CrI<sub>3</sub>. By controlling the individual layer magnetization in CrI<sub>3</sub> with a magnetic field, we show that the spin-dependent charge transfer between WSe<sub>2</sub> and CrI<sub>3</sub> is dominated by the interfacial CrI<sub>3</sub> layer, while the proximity exchange field is highly sensitive to the layered magnetic structure as a whole. In combination with reflective magnetic circular dichroism measurements, these properties allow the use of monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> as a spatially sensitive magnetic sensor to map out layered antiferromagnetic domain structures at zero magnetic field as well as antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic domains at finite magnetic fields. Our work reveals a way to control proximity effects and probe interfacial magnetic order via van der Waals engineering.</p>",[],False,"[""Ding Zhong"", ""Kyle L.

letter,Regioselective magnetization in semiconducting nanorods,"<p>Chirality&#8212;the property of an object wherein it is distinguishable from its mirror image&#8212;is of widespread interest in chemistry and biology. Regioselective magnetization of one-dimensional semiconductors enables anisotropic magnetism at room temperature, as well as the manipulation of spin polarization&#8212;the properties essential for spintronics and quantum computing technology. To enable oriented magneto-optical functionalities, the growth of magnetic units has to be achieved at targeted locations on a parent nanorod. However, this challenge is yet to be addressed in the case of materials with a large lattice mismatch. Here, we report the regioselective magnetization of nanorods independent of lattice mismatch via buffer intermediate catalytic layers that modify interfacial energetics and promote regioselective growth of otherwise incompatible materials. Using this strategy, we combine materials with distinct lattices, chemical compositions and magnetic properties, that is, a magnetic component (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and a series of semiconducting nanorods absorbing across the ultraviolet and visible spectrum at specific locations. The resulting heteronanorods exhibit optical activity as induced by the location-specific magnetic field.

letter,Synthetic gauge fields for phonon transport in a nano-optomechanical system,"<p>Gauge fields in condensed matter physics give rise to nonreciprocal and topological transport phenomena and exotic electronic states. Nanomechanical systems are applied as sensors and in signal processing, and feature strong nonlinearities. Gauge potentials acting on such systems could induce quantum Hall physics for phonons at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate a magnetic gauge field for nanomechanical vibrations in a scalable, on-chip optomechanical system. We induce the gauge field through multi-mode optomechanical interactions, which have been proposed as a resource for the necessary breaking of time-reversal symmetry. In a dynamically modulated nanophotonic system, we observe how radiation pressure forces mediate phonon transport between resonators of different frequencies. The resulting controllable interaction, which is characterized by a high rate and nonreciprocal phase, mimics the Aharonov&#8211;Bohm effect. We show that the introduced scheme does not require high-quality cavities, such that it allows exploring topological acoustic phases in many-mode systems resilient to realistic disorder.</p>",[],False,"[""John P.

letter,Thickness-controlled black phosphorus tunnel field-effect transistor for low-power switches,"<p>The continuous down-scaling of transistors has been the key to the successful development of current information technology. However, with Moore&#8217;s law reaching its limits, the development of alternative transistor architectures is urgently needed. Transistors require a switching voltage of at least 60&#8201;mV for each tenfold increase in current, that is, a subthreshold swing (SS) of 60&#8201;mV per decade (dec). Alternative tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) are widely studied to achieve a sub-thermionic SS and high I<sub>60</sub> (the current where SS becomes 60&#8201;mV&#8201;dec<sup>&#8211;1</sup>).

letter,Single-molecule tautomerization tracking through space- and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy,"<p>Tautomerization, the interconversion between two constitutional molecular isomers, is ubiquitous in nature, plays a major role in chemistry and is perceived as an ideal switch function for emerging molecular-scale devices. Within free-base porphyrin, porphycene or phthalocyanine, this process involves the concerted or sequential hopping of the two inner hydrogen atoms between equivalent nitrogen sites of the molecular cavity. Electronic and vibronic changes that result from this NH tautomerization, as well as details of the switching mechanism, were extensively studied with optical spectroscopies, even with single-molecule sensitivity. The influence of atomic-scale variations of the molecular environment and submolecular spatial resolution of the tautomerization could only be investigated using scanning probe microscopes, at the expense of detailed information provided by optical spectroscopies. Here, we combine these two approaches, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and fluorescence spectroscopy, to study the tautomerization within individual free-base phthalocyanine (H<sub>2</sub>Pc) molecules deposited on a NaCl-covered Ag(111) single-crystal surface. STM-induced fluorescence (STM-F) spectra exhibit duplicate features that we assign to the emission of the two molecular tautomers. We support this interpretation by comparing hyper-resolved fluorescence maps(HRFMs) of the different spectral contributions with simulations that account for the interaction between molecular excitons and picocavity plasmons. We identify the orientation of the molecular optical dipoles, determine the vibronic fingerprint of the tautomers and probe the influence of minute changes in their atomic-scale environment. Time-correlated fluorescence measurements allow us to monitor the tautomerization events and to associate the proton dynamics to a switching two-level system. Finally, optical spectra acquired with the tip located at a nanometre-scale distance from the molecule show that the tautomerization reaction occurs even when the tunnelling current does not pass through the molecule. Together with other observations, this remote excitation indicates that the excited state of the molecule is involved in the tautomerization reaction path.</p>",[],False,"[""Benjamin Doppagne"", ""Tom\u00e1\u0161 Neuman"", ""Ruben Soria-Martinez"", ""Luis E.

letter,Tuning inelastic light scattering via symmetry control in the two-dimensional magnet CrI3,"<p>The coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom in a crystal gives rise to magneto-optical effects with applications in the sensitive detection of local magnetic order, optical modulation and data storage. In two-dimensional magnets these effects manifest themselves in the large magneto-optical Kerr effect, spontaneous helical light emission from ferromagnetic (FM) monolayers and electric-field induced Kerr rotation and giant second-order non-reciprocal optical effects in antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayers. Here we demonstrate the tuning of inelastically scattered light through symmetry control in atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). In monolayers, we found an extraordinarily large magneto-optical Raman effect from an A<sub>1g</sub> phonon mode due to the emergence of FM order. The linearly polarized, inelastically scattered light rotates by ~40&#176;, more than two orders of magnitude larger than the rotation from the magneto-optical Kerr effect under the same experimental conditions. In CrI<sub>3</sub> bilayers, the same phonon mode becomes Davydov-split into two modes of opposite parity, which exhibit divergent selection rules that depend on inversion symmetry and the underlying magnetic order. We demonstrate the magneto-electrical control over these selection rules by activating or suppressing Raman activity for the odd-parity phonon mode and the magneto-optical rotation of scattered light from the even-parity phonon mode. Our work underlines the unique opportunities provided by two-dimensional magnets to control the combined time-reversal and inversion symmetries to manipulate Raman optical selection rules and for exploring emergent magneto-optical effects and spin&#8211;phonon coupled physics.</p>",[],False,"[""Bevin Huang"", ""John Cenker"", ""Xiaoou Zhang"", ""Essance L.

letter,Matrix mechanics and water permeation regulate extracellular vesicle transport,"<p>Cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) to communicate over long distances, which requires EVs to traverse the extracellular matrix (ECM). However, given that the size of EVs is usually larger than the mesh size of the ECM, it is not clear how they can travel through the dense ECM. Here we show that, in contrast to synthetic nanoparticles, EVs readily transport through nanoporous ECM. Using engineered hydrogels, we demonstrate that the mechanical properties of the matrix regulate anomalous EV transport under confinement. Matrix stress relaxation allows EVs to overcome the confinement, and a higher crosslinking density facilitates a fluctuating transport motion through the polymer mesh, which leads to free diffusion and fast transport. Furthermore, water permeation through aquaporin-1 mediates the EV deformability, which further supports EV transport in hydrogels and a decellularized matrix. Our results provide evidence for the nature of EV transport within confined environments and demonstrate an unexpected dependence on matrix mechanics and water permeation.</p>",[],False,"[""Stephen Lenzini"", ""Raymond Bargi"", ""Gina Chung"", ""Jae-Won Shin""]","Lenzini, S., Bargi, R., Chung, G. et al.

article,Real-time mass spectrometric characterization of the solid–electrolyte interphase of a lithium-ion battery,"<p>The solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) dictates the performance of most batteries, but the understanding of its chemistry and structure is limited by the lack of in situ experimental tools. In this work, we present a dynamic picture of the SEI formation in lithium-ion batteries using in operando liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry in combination with molecular dynamics simulations. We find that before any interphasial chemistry occurs (during the initial charging), an electric double layer forms at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the self-assembly of solvent molecules. The formation of the double layer is directed by Li<sup>+</sup> and the electrode surface potential. The structure of this double layer predicts the eventual interphasial chemistry; in particular, the negatively charged electrode surface repels salt anions from the inner layer and results in an inner SEI that is thin, dense and inorganic in nature. It is this dense layer that is responsible for conducting Li<sup>+</sup> and insulating electrons, the main functions of the SEI. An electrolyte-permeable and organic-rich outer layer appears after the formation of the inner layer. In the presence of a highly concentrated, fluoride-rich electrolyte, the inner SEI layer has an elevated concentration of LiF due to the presence of anions in the double layer. These real-time nanoscale observations will be helpful in engineering better interphases for future batteries.</p>",[],False,"[""Yufan Zhou"", ""Mao Su"", ""Xiaofei Yu"", ""Yanyan Zhang"", ""Jun-Gang Wang"", ""Xiaodi Ren"", ""Ruiguo Cao"", ""Wu Xu"", ""Donald R.

We establish that this newly discovered state could have implications for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Here, through in situ studies of electrochemical sulfur generation, we show that liquid (supercooled) and solid elementary sulfur possess very different areal capacities over the same charging period. To control the physical state of sulfur, we studied its growth on two-dimensional layered materials. We found that on the basal plane, only liquid sulfur accumulates; by contrast, at the edge sites, liquid sulfur accumulates if the thickness of the two-dimensional material is small, whereas solid sulfur nucleates if the thickness is large (tens of nanometres). Correlating the sulfur states with their respective areal capacities, as well as controlling the growth of sulfur on two-dimensional materials, could provide insights for the design of future lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.</p>",[],False,"[""Ankun Yang"", ""Guangmin Zhou"", ""Xian Kong"", ""Rafael A.
