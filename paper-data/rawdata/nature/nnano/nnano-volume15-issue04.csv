review article,Chemical reactivity under nanoconfinement,"<p>Confining molecules can fundamentally change their chemical and physical properties. Confinement effects are considered instrumental at various stages of the origins of life, and life continues to rely on layers of compartmentalization to maintain an out-of-equilibrium state and efficiently synthesize complex biomolecules under mild conditions. As interest in synthetic confined systems grows, we are realizing that the principles governing reactivity under confinement are the same in abiological systems as they are in nature. In this Review, we categorize the ways in which nanoconfinement effects impact chemical reactivity in synthetic systems. Under nanoconfinement, chemical properties can be modulated to increase reaction rates, enhance selectivity and stabilize reactive species. Confinement effects also lead to changes in physical properties. The fluorescence of light emitters, the colours of dyes and electronic communication between electroactive species can all be tuned under confinement. Within each of these categories, we elucidate design principles and strategies that are widely applicable across a range of confined systems, specifically highlighting examples of different nanocompartments that influence reactivity in similar ways.</p>",[],False,"[""Angela B.

letter,Graphene-assisted spontaneous relaxation towards dislocation-free heteroepitaxy,"<p>Although conventional homoepitaxy forms high-quality epitaxial layers, the limited set of material systems for commercially available wafers restricts the range of materials that can be grown homoepitaxially. At the same time, conventional heteroepitaxy of lattice-mismatched systems produces dislocations above a critical strain energy to release the accumulated strain energy as the film thickness increases. The formation of dislocations, which severely degrade electronic/photonic device performances, is fundamentally unavoidable in highly lattice-mismatched epitaxy. Here, we introduce a unique mechanism of relaxing misfit strain in heteroepitaxial films that can enable effective lattice engineering. We have observed that heteroepitaxy on graphene-coated substrates allows for spontaneous relaxation of misfit strain owing to the slippery graphene surface while achieving single-crystalline films by reading the atomic potential from the substrate. This spontaneous relaxation technique could transform the monolithic integration of largely lattice-mismatched systems by covering a wide range of the misfit spectrum to enhance and broaden the functionality of semiconductor devices for advanced electronics and photonics.</p>",[],False,"[""Sang-Hoon Bae"", ""Kuangye Lu"", ""Yimo Han"", ""Sungkyu Kim"", ""Kuan Qiao"", ""Chanyeol Choi"", ""Yifan Nie"", ""Hyunseok Kim"", ""Hyun S.

The strongly nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the circular polarization of the exciton emission is determined by the magnetization of the dangling-bond spins (DBSs), the exciton spin polarization as well as the spin-dependent recombination of dark excitons.

article,Filtering the photoluminescence spectra of atomically thin semiconductors with graphene,"<p>Atomically thin semiconductors made from transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are model systems for investigations of strong light&#8211;matter interactions and applications in nanophotonics, optoelectronics and valleytronics. However, the photoluminescence spectra of TMD monolayers display a large number of features that are particularly challenging to decipher. On a practical level, monochromatic TMD-based emitters would be beneficial for low-dimensional devices, but this challenge is yet to be resolved. Here, we show that graphene, directly stacked onto TMD monolayers, enables single and narrow-line photoluminescence arising solely from TMD neutral excitons. This filtering effect stems from complete neutralization of the TMD by graphene, combined with selective non-radiative transfer of long-lived excitonic species to graphene. Our approach is applied to four tungsten- and molybdenum-based TMDs and establishes TMD/graphene heterostructures as a unique set of optoelectronic building blocks that are suitable for electroluminescent systems emitting visible and near-infrared photons at near THz rate with linewidths approaching the homogeneous limit.</p>",[],False,"[""Etienne Lorchat"", ""Luis E.

article,Neuronal firing modulation by a membrane-targeted photoswitch,"<p>Optical technologies allowing modulation of neuronal activity at high spatio-temporal resolution are becoming paramount in neuroscience. In this respect, azobenzene-based photoswitches are promising nanoscale tools for neuronal photostimulation. Here we engineered a light-sensitive azobenzene compound (Ziapin2) that stably partitions into the plasma membrane and causes its thinning through trans-dimerization in the dark, resulting in an increased membrane capacitance at steady state. We demonstrated that in neurons loaded with the compound, millisecond pulses of visible light induce a transient hyperpolarization followed by a delayed depolarization that triggers action potential firing. These effects are persistent and can be evoked in vivo up to 7 days, proving the potential of Ziapin2 for the modulation of membrane capacitance in the millisecond timescale, without directly affecting ion channels or local temperature.</p>",[],False,"[""Mattia Lorenzo DiFrancesco"", ""Francesco Lodola"", ""Elisabetta Colombo"", ""Luca Maragliano"", ""Mattia Bramini"", ""Giuseppe Maria Patern\u00f2"", ""Pietro Baldelli"", ""Mauro Dalla Serra"", ""Lorenzo Lunelli"", ""Marta Marchioretto"", ""Giorgio Grasselli"", ""Simone Cim\u00f2"", ""Letizia Colella"", ""Daniele Fazzi"", ""Fausto Ortica"", ""Vito Vurro"", ""Cyril Giles Eleftheriou"", ""Dmytro Shmal"", ""Jos\u00e9 Fernando Maya-Vetencourt"", ""Chiara Bertarelli"", ""Guglielmo Lanzani"", ""Fabio Benfenati""]","DiFrancesco, M.L., Lodola, F., Colombo, E. et al.

Lung-, spleen- and liver-targeted SORT lipid nanoparticles were designed to selectively edit therapeutically relevant cell types including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, B cells, T cells and hepatocytes.

Indeed, alterations of potassium levels can be related to neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and, therefore, selectively detecting extracellular potassium would allow the monitoring of disease. However, currently available optical reporters are not capable of detecting small changes in potassium, in particular, in freely moving animals. Furthermore, they are susceptible to interference from sodium ions. Here, we report a highly sensitive and specific potassium nanosensor that can monitor potassium changes in the brain of freely moving mice undergoing epileptic seizures. An optical potassium indicator is embedded in mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which are shielded by an ultrathin layer of a potassium-permeable membrane, which prevents diffusion of other cations and allows the specific capturing of potassium ions.

article,Targeted crystallization of mixed-charge nanoparticles in lysosomes induces selective death of cancer cells,"<p>Lysosomes have become an important target for anticancer therapeutics because lysosomal cell death bypasses the classical caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway, enabling the targeting of apoptosis- and drug-resistant cancers. However, only a few small molecules&#8212;mostly repurposed drugs&#8212;have been tested so far, and these typically exhibit low cancer selectivity, making them suitable only for combination therapies. Here, we show that mixed-charge nanoparticles covered with certain ratios of positively and negatively charged ligands can selectively target lysosomes in cancerous cells while exhibiting only marginal cytotoxicity towards normal cells. This selectivity results from distinct pH-dependent aggregation events, starting from the formation of small, endocytosis-prone clusters at cell surfaces and ending with the formation of large and well-ordered nanoparticle assemblies and crystals inside cancer lysosomes. These assemblies cannot be cleared by exocytosis and cause lysosome swelling, which gradually disrupts the integrity of lysosomal membranes, ultimately impairing lysosomal functions and triggering cell death.</p>",[],False,"[""Magdalena Borkowska"", ""Marta Siek"", ""Diana V.
