review article,MOF water harvesters,"<p>The advancement of additional methods for freshwater generation is imperative to effectively address the global water shortage crisis. In this regard, extraction of the ubiquitous atmospheric moisture is a powerful strategy allowing for decentralized access to potable water. The energy requirements as well as the temporal and spatial restrictions of this approach can be substantially reduced if an appropriate sorbent is integrated in the atmospheric water generator. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been successfully employed as sorbents to harvest water from air, making atmospheric water generation viable even in desert environments. Herein, the latest progress in the development of MOFs capable of extracting water from air and the design of atmospheric water harvesters deploying such MOFs are reviewed. Furthermore, future directions for this emerging field, encompassing both material and device improvements, are outlined.</p>",[],False,"[""Nikita Hanikel"", ""Mathieu S. Pr\u00e9vot"", ""Omar M.

letter,Time-resolved imaging of three-dimensional nanoscale magnetization dynamics,"<p>Understanding and control of the dynamic response of magnetic materials with a three-dimensional magnetization distribution is important both fundamentally and for technological applications. From a fundamental point of view, the internal magnetic structure and dynamics in bulk materials still need to be mapped, including the dynamic properties of topological structures such as vortices, magnetic singularities or skyrmion lattices. From a technological point of view, the response of inductive materials to magnetic fields and spin-polarized currents is essential for magnetic sensors and data storage devices. Here, we demonstrate time-resolved magnetic laminography, a pump&#8211;probe technique, which offers access to the temporal evolution of a three-dimensional magnetic microdisc with nanoscale resolution, and with a synchrotron-limited temporal resolution of 70&#8201;ps. We image the dynamic response to a 500&#8201;MHz magnetic field of the complex three-dimensional magnetization in a two-phase bulk magnet with a lateral spatial resolution of 50&#8201;nm. This is achieved with a stroboscopic measurement consisting of eight time steps evenly spaced over 2&#8201;ns. These measurements map the spatial transition between domain wall motion and the dynamics of a uniform magnetic domain that is attributed to variations in the magnetization state across the phase boundary. Our technique, which probes three-dimensional magnetic structures with temporal resolution, enables the experimental investigation of functionalities arising from dynamic phenomena in bulk and three-dimensional patterned nanomagnets.</p>",[],False,"[""Claire Donnelly"", ""Simone Finizio"", ""Sebastian Gliga"", ""Mirko Holler"", ""Ale\u0161 Hrabec"", ""Michal Odstr\u010dil"", ""Sina Mayr"", ""Valerio Scagnoli"", ""Laura J.

letter,Creation of magnetic skyrmions by surface acoustic waves,"<p>Non-collinear and non-coplanar spin textures, such as chiral domain walls and helical or triangular spin structures, bring about diverse functionalities. Among them, magnetic skyrmions, particle-like non-coplanar topological spin structures characterized by a non-zero integer topological charge called the skyrmion number (N<sub>sk</sub>), have great potential for various spintronic applications, such as energy-saving, non-volatile memory and non-von Neumann devices. Current pulses can initiate skyrmion creation in thin-film samples but require relatively large current densities, which probably causes Joule heating. Moreover, skyrmion creation is localized at a specific position in the film depending on the sample design. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an approach to skyrmion creation employing surface acoustic waves (SAWs); in asymmetric multilayers of Pt/Co/Ir, propagating SAWs induce skyrmions in a wide area of the magnetic film. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that inhomogeneous torque arising from both SAWs and thermal fluctuations creates magnetic textures, with pair structures consisting of a N&#233;el skyrmion-like and an antiskyrmion-like structure. Subsequently, such pairs transform to a N&#233;el skyrmion due to the instability of the antiskyrmion-like structure in a system with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. Our findings provide a tool for efficient manipulation of topological spin objects without heat dissipation and over large areas, given that the propagation length of SAWs is of the order of millimetres.</p>",[],False,"[""Tomoyuki Yokouchi"", ""Satoshi Sugimoto"", ""Bivas Rana"", ""Shinichiro Seki"", ""Naoki Ogawa"", ""Shinya Kasai"", ""Yoshichika Otani""]","Yokouchi, T., Sugimoto, S., Rana, B. et al.

letter,A monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide as a topological excitonic insulator,"<p>Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in the T&#8242; phase could enable the realization of the quantum spin Hall effect at room temperature, because they exhibit a prominent spin&#8211;orbit gap between inverted bands in the bulk. Here we show that the binding energy of electron&#8211;hole pairs excited through this gap is larger than the gap itself in the paradigmatic case of monolayer T&#8242; MoS<sub>2</sub>, which we investigate from first principles using many-body perturbation theory. This paradoxical result hints at the instability of the T&#8242; phase in the presence of spontaneous generation of excitons, and we predict that it will give rise to a reconstructed &#8216;excitonic insulator&#8217; ground state. Importantly, we show that in this monolayer system, topological and excitonic order cooperatively enhance the bulk gap by breaking the crystal inversion symmetry, in contrast to the case of bilayers where the frustration between the two orders is relieved by breaking time reversal symmetry. The excitonic topological insulator is distinct from the bare topological phase because it lifts the band spin degeneracy, which results in circular dichroism. A moderate biaxial strain applied to the system leads to two additional excitonic phases, different in their topological character but both ferroelectric as an effect of electron&#8211;electron interaction.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniele Varsano"", ""Maurizia Palummo"", ""Elisa Molinari"", ""Massimo Rontani""]","Varsano, D., Palummo, M., Molinari, E. et al.A monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide as a topological excitonic insulator.

letter,Phage capsid nanoparticles with defined ligand arrangement block influenza virus entry,"<p>Multivalent interactions at biological interfaces occur frequently in nature and mediate recognition and interactions in essential physiological processes such as cell-to-cell adhesion. Multivalency is also a key principle that allows tight binding between pathogens and host cells during the initial stages of infection. One promising approach to prevent infection is the design of synthetic or semisynthetic multivalent binders that interfere with pathogen adhesion. Here, we present a multivalent binder that is based on a spatially defined arrangement of ligands for the viral spike protein haemagglutinin of the influenza A virus. Complementary experimental and theoretical approaches demonstrate that bacteriophage capsids, which carry host cell haemagglutinin ligands in an arrangement matching the geometry of binding sites of the spike protein, can bind to viruses in a defined multivalent mode. These capsids cover the entire virus envelope, thus preventing its binding to the host cell as visualized by cryo-electron tomography. As a consequence, virus infection can be inhibited in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Such highly functionalized capsids present an alternative to strategies that target virus entry by spike-inhibiting antibodies and peptides or that address late steps of the viral replication cycle.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel Lauster"", ""Simon Klenk"", ""Kai Ludwig"", ""Saba Nojoumi"", ""Sandra Behren"", ""Lutz Adam"", ""Marlena Stadtm\u00fcller"", ""Sandra Saenger"", ""Stephanie Zimmler"", ""Katja H\u00f6nzke"", ""Ling Yao"", ""Ute Hoffmann"", ""Markus Bardua"", ""Alf Hamann"", ""Martin Witzenrath"", ""Leif E.

article,Charge disproportionate molecular redox for discrete memristive and memcapacitive switching,"<p>Electronic symmetry breaking by charge disproportionation results in multifaceted changes in the electronic, magnetic and optical properties of a material, triggering ferroelectricity, metal/insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance. Yet, charge disproportionation lacks technological relevance because it occurs only under specific physical conditions of high or low temperature or high pressure. Here we demonstrate a voltage-triggered charge disproportionation in thin molecular films of a metal&#8211;organic complex occurring in ambient conditions. This provides a technologically relevant molecular route for simultaneous realization of a ternary memristor and a binary memcapacitor, scalable down to a device area of 60&#8201;nm<sup>2</sup>. Supported by mathematical modelling, our results establish that multiple memristive states can be functionally non-volatile, yet discrete&#8212;a combination perceived as theoretically prohibited. Our device could be used as a binary or ternary memristor, a binary memcapacitor or both concomitantly, and unlike the existing &#8216;continuous state&#8217; memristors, its discrete states are optimal for high-density, ultra-low-energy digital computing.</p>",[],False,"[""Sreetosh Goswami"", ""Santi P.

article,Single-atom Rh/N-doped carbon electrocatalyst for formic acid oxidation,"<p>To meet the requirements of potential applications, it is of great importance to explore new catalysts for formic acid oxidation that have both ultra-high mass activity and CO resistance. Here, we successfully synthesize atomically dispersed Rh on N-doped carbon (SA-Rh/CN) and discover that SA-Rh/CN exhibits promising electrocatalytic properties for formic acid oxidation. The mass activity shows 28- and 67-fold enhancements compared with state-of-the-art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively, despite the low activity of Rh/C. Interestingly, SA-Rh/CN exhibits greatly enhanced tolerance to CO poisoning, and Rh atoms in SA-Rh/CN resist sintering after long-term testing, resulting in excellent catalytic stability. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the formate route is more favourable on SA-Rh/CN. According to calculations, the high barrier to produce CO, together with the relatively unfavourable binding with CO, contribute to its CO tolerance.</p>",[],True,"[""Yu Xiong"", ""Juncai Dong"", ""Zheng-Qing Huang"", ""Pingyu Xin"", ""Wenxing Chen"", ""Yu Wang"", ""Zhi Li"", ""Zhao Jin"", ""Wei Xing"", ""Zhongbin Zhuang"", ""Jinyu Ye"", ""Xing Wei"", ""Rui Cao"", ""Lin Gu"", ""Shigang Sun"", ""Lin Zhuang"", ""Xiaoqing Chen"", ""Hua Yang"", ""Chen Chen"", ""Qing Peng"", ""Chun-Ran Chang"", ""Dingsheng Wang"", ""Yadong Li""]","Xiong, Y., Dong, J., Huang, ZQ. et al.
