article,Tailoring topological order and π-conjugation to engineer quasi-metallic polymers,"<p>Topological band theory predicts that a topological electronic phase transition between two insulators must proceed via closure of the electronic gap. Here, we use this transition to circumvent the instability of metallic phases in &#960;-conjugated one-dimensional (1D) polymers. By means of density functional theory, tight-binding and GW calculations, we predict polymers near the topological transition from a trivial to a non-trivial quantum phase. We then use on-surface synthesis with custom-designed precursors to make polymers consisting of 1D linearly bridged acene moieties, which feature narrow bandgaps and in-gap zero-energy edge states when in the topologically non-trivial phase close to the topological transition point.

article,Nanometric square skyrmion lattice in a centrosymmetric tetragonal magnet,"<p>Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable spin swirls with a particle-like character and are potentially suitable for the design of high-density information bits. Although most known skyrmion systems arise in non-centrosymmetric systems with a Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, centrosymmetric magnets with a triangular lattice can also give rise to skyrmion formation, with a geometrically frustrated lattice being considered essential in this case. Until now, it remains an open question if skyrmions can also exist in the absence of both geometrically frustrated lattice and inversion symmetry breaking. Here we discover a square skyrmion lattice state with 1.9&#8201;nm diameter skyrmions in the centrosymmetric tetragonal magnet GdRu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> without a geometrically frustrated lattice by means of resonant X-ray scattering and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments. A plausible origin of the observed skyrmion formation is four-spin interactions mediated by itinerant electrons in the presence of easy-axis anisotropy. Our results suggest that rare-earth intermetallics with highly symmetric crystal lattices may ubiquitously host nanometric skyrmions of exotic origins.</p>",[],False,"[""Nguyen Duy Khanh"", ""Taro Nakajima"", ""Xiuzhen Yu"", ""Shang Gao"", ""Kiyou Shibata"", ""Max Hirschberger"", ""Yuichi Yamasaki"", ""Hajime Sagayama"", ""Hironori Nakao"", ""Licong Peng"", ""Kiyomi Nakajima"", ""Rina Takagi"", ""Taka-hisa Arima"", ""Yoshinori Tokura"", ""Shinichiro Seki""]","Khanh, N.D., Nakajima, T., Yu, X. et al.

article,Probing nanoscale fluctuation of ferromagnetic meta-atoms with a stochastic photonic spin Hall effect,"<p>The photonic spin Hall effect, a deep subdiffraction-limited shift between the opposite spin components of light, emerges when light undergoes an evolution of polarization or trajectory that induces the geometric phase. Here, we study a stochastic photonic spin Hall effect arising from space-variant Berry&#8211;Zak phases, which are generated by disordered magneto-optical effects. This spin shift is observed from a spatially bounded lattice of ferromagnetic meta-atoms displaying nanoscale disorders. A random variation of the radii of the meta-atoms induces the nanoscale fluctuation. The standard deviation of the probability distribution of the spin shifts is proportional to the fluctuation of the meta-atoms. This enables us to detect a five-nanometre fluctuation by measuring the probability distribution of the spin shifts via weak measurements. Our approach may be used for sensing deep-subwavelength disorders by actively breaking the photonic spin symmetry and may enable investigations of fluctuation effects in magnetic nanosystems.</p>",[],False,"[""Bo Wang"", ""Kexiu Rong"", ""Elhanan Maguid"", ""Vladimir Kleiner"", ""Erez Hasman""]","Wang, B., Rong, K., Maguid, E. et al.

article,Bose–Einstein condensation of quasiparticles by rapid cooling,"<p>The fundamental phenomenon of Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation has been observed in different systems of real particles and quasiparticles. The condensation of real particles is achieved through a major reduction in temperature, while for quasiparticles, a mechanism of external injection of bosons by irradiation is required. Here, we present a new and universal approach to enable Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation of quasiparticles and to corroborate it experimentally by using magnons as the Bose-particle model system. The critical point to this approach is the introduction of a disequilibrium of magnons with the phonon bath. After heating to an elevated temperature, a sudden decrease in the temperature of the phonons, which is approximately instant on the time scales of the magnon system, results in a large excess of incoherent magnons. The consequent spectral redistribution of these magnons triggers the Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation.</p>",[],False,"[""Michael Schneider"", ""Thomas Br\u00e4cher"", ""David Breitbach"", ""Viktor Lauer"", ""Philipp Pirro"", ""Dmytro A.

article,"Efficient, fast and reabsorption-free perovskite nanocrystal-based sensitized plastic scintillators","<p>The urgency for affordable and reliable detectors for ionizing radiation in medical diagnostics, nuclear control and particle physics is generating growing demand for scintillator devices combining efficient scintillation, fast emission lifetime, high interaction probability with ionizing radiation and mitigated reabsorption losses in large-volume/high-density detectors.

article,Optomechanical detection of vibration modes of a single bacterium,"<p>Low-frequency vibration modes of biological particles, such as proteins, viruses and bacteria, involve coherent collective vibrations at frequencies in the terahertz and gigahertz domains. These vibration modes carry information on their structure and mechanical properties, which are good indicators of their biological state. In this work, we harnessed a particular regime in the physics of coupled mechanical resonators to directly measure these low-frequency mechanical resonances of a single bacterium. We deposit the bacterium on the surface of an ultrahigh frequency optomechanical disk resonator in ambient conditions. The vibration modes of the disk and bacterium hybridize when their associated frequencies are similar. We developed a general theoretical framework to describe this coupling, which allows us to retrieve the eigenfrequencies and mechanical loss of the bacterium low-frequency vibration modes (quality factor). Additionally, we analysed the effect of hydration on these vibrational modes. This work demonstrates that ultrahigh frequency optomechanical resonators can be used for vibrational spectrometry with the unique capability to obtain information on single biological entities.</p>",[],False,"[""Eduardo Gil-Santos"", ""Jose J.

article,Spontaneous and reversible hollowing of alloy anode nanocrystals for stable battery cycling,"<p>High-capacity alloy anode materials for Li-ion batteries have long been held back by limited cyclability caused by the large volume changes during lithium insertion and removal. Hollow and yolk-shell nanostructures have been used to increase the cycling stability by providing an inner void space to accommodate volume changes and a mechanically and dimensionally stable outer surface. These materials, however, require complex synthesis procedures. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we show that sufficiently small antimony nanocrystals spontaneously form uniform voids on the removal of lithium, which are then reversibly filled and vacated during cycling. This behaviour is found to arise from a resilient native oxide layer that allows for an initial expansion during lithiation but mechanically prevents shrinkage as antimony forms voids during delithiation. We developed a chemomechanical model that explains these observations, and we demonstrate that this behaviour is size dependent. Thus, antimony naturally evolves to form optimal nanostructures for alloy anodes, as we show through electrochemical experiments in a half-cell configuration in which 15-nm antimony nanocrystals have a consistently higher Coulombic efficiency than larger nanoparticles.</p>",[],False,"[""Matthew G.

However, owing to the unique structure of the lymphatics and the size-restrictive nature of the lymph node reticular network, delivering cargo to specific cells in the lymph node cortex and paracortex is difficult. Here, we describe a delivery system to overcome lymphatic and intra-lymph node transport barriers by combining nanoparticles that are rapidly conveyed to draining lymph nodes after administration in peripheral tissues with programmable degradable linkers. This platform enables the controlled release of intra-lymph-mobile small-molecular cargo, which can reach vastly more immune cells throughout the lymph node than either the particles or free compounds alone. The release rate can be programmed, allowing access to different lymph node structures and therefore specific lymphocyte subpopulations.
