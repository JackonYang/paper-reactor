review article,Neuromorphic nanoelectronic materials,"<p>Memristive and nanoionic devices have recently emerged as leading candidates for neuromorphic computing architectures. While top-down fabrication based on conventional bulk materials has enabled many early neuromorphic devices and circuits, bottom-up approaches based on low-dimensional nanomaterials have shown novel device functionality that often better mimics a biological neuron. In addition, the chemical, structural and compositional tunability of low-dimensional nanomaterials coupled with the permutational flexibility enabled by van der Waals heterostructures offers significant opportunities for artificial neural networks. In this Review, we present a critical survey of emerging neuromorphic devices and architectures enabled by quantum dots, metal nanoparticles, polymers, nanotubes, nanowires, two-dimensional layered materials and van der Waals heterojunctions with a particular emphasis on bio-inspired device responses that are uniquely enabled by low-dimensional topology, quantum confinement and interfaces.

review article,Memory devices and applications for in-memory computing,"<p>Traditional von Neumann computing systems involve separate processing and memory units. However, data movement is costly in terms of time and energy and this problem is aggravated by the recent explosive growth in highly data-centric applications related to artificial intelligence. This calls for a radical departure from the traditional systems and one such non-von Neumann computational approach is in-memory computing. Hereby certain computational tasks are performed in place in the memory itself by exploiting the physical attributes of the memory devices. Both charge-based and resistance-based memory devices are being explored for in-memory computing.

To meet the growing data-driven demand, in-memory computing and transistor-based computing have emerged as potent technologies for the implementation of matrix and logic computing. However, to fulfil the future computing requirements new materials are urgently needed to complement the existing Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology and new technologies must be developed to enable further diversification of electronics and their applications. The abundance and rich variety of electronic properties of two-dimensional materials have endowed them with the potential to enhance computing energy efficiency while enabling continued device downscaling to a feature size below 5 nm.

letter,Radiative Auger process in the single-photon limit,"<p>In a multi-electron atom, an excited electron can decay by emitting a photon. Typically, the leftover electrons are in their ground state. In a radiative Auger process, the leftover electrons are in an excited state and a redshifted photon is created. In a semiconductor quantum dot, radiative Auger is predicted for charged excitons. Here we report the observation of radiative Auger on trions in single quantum dots. For a trion, a photon is created on electron&#8211;hole recombination, leaving behind a single electron. The radiative Auger process promotes this additional (Auger) electron to a higher shell of the quantum dot. We show that the radiative Auger effect is a powerful probe of this single electron: the energy separations between the resonance fluorescence and the radiative Auger emission directly measure the single-particle splittings of the electronic states in the quantum dot with high precision. In semiconductors, these single-particle splittings are otherwise hard to access by optical means as particles are excited typically in pairs, as excitons. After the radiative Auger emission, the Auger carrier relaxes back to the lowest shell. Going beyond the original theoretical proposals, we show how applying quantum optics techniques to the radiative Auger photons gives access to the single-electron dynamics, notably relaxation and tunnelling. This is also hard to access by optical means: even for quasi-resonant p-shell excitation, electron relaxation takes place in the presence of a hole, complicating the relaxation dynamics. The radiative Auger effect can be exploited in other semiconductor nanostructures and quantum emitters in the solid state to determine the energy levels and the dynamics of a single carrier.</p>",[],False,"[""Matthias C.

letter,Birefringence-like spin transport via linearly polarized antiferromagnetic magnons,"<p>Antiferromagnets (AFMs) possess great potential in spintronics because of their immunity to external magnetic disturbance, the absence of a stray field or the resonance in the terahertz range. The coupling of insulating AFMs to spin&#8211;orbit materials enables spin transport via AFM magnons. In particular, spin transmission over several micrometres occurs in some AFMs with easy-axis anisotropy. Easy-plane AFMs with two orthogonal, linearly polarized magnon eigenmodes own unique advantages for low-energy control of ultrafast magnetic dynamics. However, it is commonly conceived that these magnon modes are less likely to transmit spins because of their vanishing angular momentum. Here we report experimental evidence that an easy-plane insulating AFM, an &#945;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin film, can efficiently transmit spins over micrometre distances. The spin decay length shows an unconventional temperature dependence that cannot be captured considering solely thermal magnon scatterings. We interpret our observations in terms of an interference of two linearly polarized, propagating magnons in analogy to the birefringence effect in optics. Furthermore, our devices can realize a bi-stable spin-current switch with a 100% on/off ratio under zero remnant magnetic field. These findings provide additional tools for non-volatile, low-field control of spin transport in AFM systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiahao Han"", ""Pengxiang Zhang"", ""Zhen Bi"", ""Yabin Fan"", ""Taqiyyah S.

letter,Odd- and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in monolayer WSe2,"<p>Monolayer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent a unique class of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems. Their atomically thin structure facilitates gate tunability just like graphene does, but unlike graphene, TMDs have the advantage of a sizable band gap and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Measurements under large magnetic fields have revealed an unusual Landau level (LL) structure, distinct from other 2D electron systems. However, owing to the limited sample quality and poor electrical contact, probing the lowest LLs has been challenging, and observation of electron correlations within the fractionally filled LL regime has not been possible. Here, through bulk electronic compressibility measurements, we investigate the LL structure of monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> in the extreme quantum limit, and observe fractional quantum Hall states in the lowest three LLs. The odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall sequences demonstrate a systematic evolution with the LL orbital index, consistent with generic theoretical expectations. In addition, we observe an even-denominator state in the second LL that is expected to host non-Abelian statistics. Our results suggest that the 2D semiconductors can provide an experimental platform that closely resembles idealized theoretical models in the quantum Hall regime.</p>",[],False,"[""Qianhui Shi"", ""En-Min Shih"", ""Martin V.

letter,Alloying conducting channels for reliable neuromorphic computing,"<p>A memristor has been proposed as an artificial synapse for emerging neuromorphic computing applications. To train a neural network in memristor arrays, changes in weight values in the form of device conductance should be distinct and uniform. An electrochemical metallization (ECM) memory, typically based on silicon (Si), has demonstrated a good analogue switching capability owing to the high mobility of metal ions in the Si switching medium. However, the large stochasticity of the ion movement results in switching variability. Here we demonstrate a Si memristor with alloyed conduction channels that shows a stable and controllable device operation, which enables the large-scale implementation of crossbar arrays. The conduction channel is formed by conventional silver (Ag) as a primary mobile metal alloyed with silicidable copper (Cu) that stabilizes switching. In an optimal alloying ratio, Cu effectively regulates the Ag movement, which contributes to a substantial improvement in the spatial/temporal switching uniformity, a stable data retention over a large conductance range and a substantially enhanced programmed symmetry in analogue conductance states. This alloyed memristor allows the fabrication of large-scale crossbar arrays that feature a high device yield and accurate analogue programming capability. Thus, our discovery of an alloyed memristor is a key step paving the way beyond von Neumann computing.</p>",[],False,"[""Hanwool Yeon"", ""Peng Lin"", ""Chanyeol Choi"", ""Scott H.

letter,Visualization of moiré superlattices,"<p>Moir&#233; superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures have given rise to a number of emergent electronic phenomena due to the interplay between atomic structure and electron correlations. Indeed, electrons in these structures have been recently found to exhibit a number of emergent properties that the individual layers themselves do not exhibit. This includes superconductivity, magnetism, topological edge states, exciton trapping and correlated insulator phases. However, the lack of a straightforward technique to characterize the local structure of moir&#233; superlattices has thus far impeded progress in the field. In this work we describe a simple, room-temperature, ambient method to visualize real-space moir&#233; superlattices with sub-5-nm spatial resolution in a variety of twisted van der Waals heterostructures including, but not limited to, conducting graphene, insulating boron nitride and semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. Our method uses piezoresponse force microscopy, an atomic force microscope modality that locally measures electromechanical surface deformation. We find that all moir&#233; superlattices, regardless of whether the constituent layers have inversion symmetry, exhibit a mechanical response to out-of-plane electric fields. This response is closely tied to flexoelectricity wherein electric polarization and electromechanical response is induced through strain gradients present within moir&#233; superlattices. Therefore, moir&#233; superlattices of two-dimensional materials manifest themselves as an interlinked network of polarized domain walls in a non-polar background matrix.</p>",[],False,"[""Leo J.

article,Quantum Hall effect of Weyl fermions in n-type semiconducting tellurene,"<p>Dirac and Weyl nodal materials can host low-energy relativistic quasiparticles. Under strong magnetic fields, the topological properties of Dirac/Weyl materials can directly be observed through quantum Hall states. However, most Dirac/Weyl nodes generically exist in semimetals without exploitable band gaps due to their accidental band-crossing origin. Here, we report the first experimental observation of Weyl fermions in a semiconductor. Tellurene, the two-dimensional form of tellurium, possesses a chiral crystal structure which induces unconventional Weyl nodes with a hedgehog-like radial spin texture near the conduction band edge. We synthesize high-quality n-type tellurene by a hydrothermal method with subsequent dielectric doping and detect a topologically non-trivial &#960; Berry phase in quantum Hall sequences.

article,Atomic reconstruction in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides,"<p>Van der Waals heterostructures form a unique class of layered artificial solids in which physical properties can be manipulated through controlled composition, order and relative rotation of adjacent atomic planes. Here we use atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy to reveal the lattice reconstruction in twisted bilayers of the transition metal dichalcogenides, MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>.

The electronic properties of these 3R domains, featuring layer-polarized conduction-band states caused by lack of both inversion and mirror symmetry, appear to be qualitatively different from those of 2H transition metal dichalcogenides. For twisted 2H bilayers, stable 2H domains dominate, with nuclei of a second metastable phase. This appears as a kagome-like pattern at &#952;&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;2&#176;, transitioning at &#952;&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;0 to a hexagonal array of screw dislocations separating large-area 2H domains.

However, due to their light mass, small size and high chemical reactivity, uncovering the surface transport of single protons at room temperature and in an aqueous environment has so far remained out-of-reach of conventional atomic-scale surface science techniques, such as scanning tunnelling microscopy. Here, we use single-molecule localization microscopy to resolve optically the transport of individual excess protons at the interface of hexagonal boron nitride crystals and aqueous solutions at room temperature. Single excess proton trajectories are revealed by the successive protonation and activation of optically active defects at the surface of the crystal.
