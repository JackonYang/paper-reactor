review article,Immune-mediated approaches against COVID-19,"<p>The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The long incubation period of this new virus, which is mostly asymptomatic yet contagious, is a key reason for its rapid spread across the world. Currently, there is no worldwide-approved treatment for COVID-19. Therefore, the clinical and scientific communities have joint efforts to reduce the severe impact of the outbreak. Research on previous emerging infectious diseases have created valuable knowledge that is being exploited for drug repurposing and accelerated vaccine development. Nevertheless, it is important to generate knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of infection and its impact on host immunity, to guide the design of COVID-19 specific therapeutics and vaccines suitable for mass immunization. Nanoscale delivery systems are expected to play a paramount role in the success of these prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. This Review provides an overview of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and examines immune-mediated approaches currently explored for COVID-19 treatments, with an emphasis on nanotechnological tools.</p>",[],True,"[""Helena F.

review article,COVID-19 vaccine development and a potential nanomaterial path forward,"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with no clear signs of abatement owing to the high prevalence, long incubation period and lack of established treatments or vaccines. Vaccines are the most promising solution to mitigate new viral strains. The genome sequence and protein structure of the 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) were made available in record time, allowing the development of inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines along with subunit vaccines for prophylaxis and treatment. Nanotechnology benefits modern vaccine design since nanomaterials are ideal for antigen delivery, as adjuvants, and as mimics of viral structures. In fact, the first vaccine candidate launched into clinical trials is an mRNA vaccine delivered via lipid nanoparticles. To eradicate pandemics, present and future, a successful vaccine platform must enable rapid discovery, scalable manufacturing and global distribution. Here, we review current approaches to COVID-19 vaccine development and highlight the role of nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing.</p>",[],True,"[""Matthew D.

letter,A Josephson phase battery,"<p>A classical battery converts chemical energy into a persistent voltage bias that can power electronic circuits. Similarly, a phase battery is a quantum device that provides a persistent phase bias to the wave function of a quantum circuit. It represents a key element for quantum technologies based on phase coherence. Here we demonstrate a phase battery in a hybrid superconducting circuit. It consists of an n-doped InAs nanowire with unpaired-spin surface states, that is proximitized by Al superconducting leads. We find that the ferromagnetic polarization of the unpaired-spin states is efficiently converted into a persistent phase bias &#966;<sub>0</sub> across the wire, leading to the anomalous Josephson effect. We apply an external in-plane magnetic field and, thereby, achieve continuous tuning of &#966;<sub>0</sub>. Hence, we can charge and discharge the quantum phase battery. The observed symmetries of the anomalous Josephson effect in the vectorial magnetic field are in agreement with our theoretical model. Our results demonstrate how the combined action of spin&#8211;orbit coupling and exchange interaction induces a strong coupling between charge, spin and superconducting phase, able to break the phase rigidity of the system.</p>",[],False,"[""Elia Strambini"", ""Andrea Iorio"", ""Ofelia Durante"", ""Roberta Citro"", ""Cristina Sanz-Fern\u00e1ndez"", ""Claudio Guarcello"", ""Ilya V.

letter,Flexoelectronics of centrosymmetric semiconductors,"<p>Interface engineering by local polarization using piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric effects has attracted considerable attention as a promising approach for tunable electronics/optoelectronics, human&#8211;machine interfacing and artificial intelligence. However, this approach has mainly been applied to non-centrosymmetric semiconductors, such as wurtzite-structured ZnO and GaN, limiting its practical applications. Here we demonstrate an electronic regulation mechanism, the flexoelectronics, which is applicable to any semiconductor type, expanding flexoelectricity to conventional semiconductors such as Si, Ge and GaAs. The inner-crystal polarization potential generated by the flexoelectric field serving as a &#8216;gate&#8217; can be used to modulate the metal&#8211;semiconductor interface Schottky barrier and further tune charge-carrier transport. We observe a giant flexoelectronic effect in bulk centrosymmetric semiconductors of Si, TiO<sub>2</sub> and Nb&#8211;SrTiO<sub>3</sub> with high strain sensitivity (&gt;2,650), largely outperforming state-of-the-art Si-nanowire strain sensors and even piezoresistive, piezoelectric and ferroelectric nanodevices. The effect can be used to mechanically switch the electronics in the nanoscale with fast response (&lt;4&#8201;ms) and high resolution (~0.78&#8201;nm). This opens up the possibility of realizing strain-modulated electronics in centrosymmetric semiconductors, paving the way for local polarization field-controlled electronics and high-performance electromechanical applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Longfei Wang"", ""Shuhai Liu"", ""Xiaolong Feng"", ""Chunli Zhang"", ""Laipan Zhu"", ""Junyi Zhai"", ""Yong Qin"", ""Zhong Lin Wang""]","Wang, L., Liu, S., Feng, X. et al.

letter,Bipolar-shell resurfacing for blue LEDs based on strongly confined perovskite quantum dots,"<p>Colloidal quantum dot (QD) solids are emerging semiconductors that have been actively explored in fundamental studies of charge transport and for applications in optoelectronics. Forming high-quality QD solids&#8212;necessary for device fabrication&#8212;requires substitution of the long organic ligands used for synthesis with short ligands that provide increased QD coupling and improved charge transport. However, in perovskite QDs, the polar solvents used to carry out the ligand exchange decompose the highly ionic perovskites. Here we report perovskite QD resurfacing to achieve a bipolar shell consisting of an inner anion shell, and an outer shell comprised of cations and polar solvent molecules. The outer shell is electrostatically adsorbed to the negatively charged inner shell. This approach produces strongly confined perovskite QD solids that feature improved carrier mobility (&#8805;0.01&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>&#8201;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and reduced trap density relative to previously reported low-dimensional perovskites. Blue-emitting QD films exhibit photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 90%. By exploiting the improved mobility, we have been able to fabricate CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QD-based efficient blue and green light-emitting diodes. Blue devices with reduced trap density have an external quantum efficiency of 12.3%; the green devices achieve an external quantum efficiency of 22%.</p>",[],False,"[""Yitong Dong"", ""Ya-Kun Wang"", ""Fanglong Yuan"", ""Andrew Johnston"", ""Yuan Liu"", ""Dongxin Ma"", ""Min-Jae Choi"", ""Bin Chen"", ""Mahshid Chekini"", ""Se-Woong Baek"", ""Laxmi Kishore Sagar"", ""James Fan"", ""Yi Hou"", ""Mingjian Wu"", ""Seungjin Lee"", ""Bin Sun"", ""Sjoerd Hoogland"", ""Rafael Quintero-Bermudez"", ""Hinako Ebe"", ""Petar Todorovic"", ""Filip Dinic"", ""Peicheng Li"", ""Hao Ting Kung"", ""Makhsud I.

article,High oscillator strength interlayer excitons in two-dimensional heterostructures for mid-infrared photodetection,"<p>The development of infrared photodetectors is mainly limited by the choice of available materials and the intricate crystal growth process. Moreover, thermally activated carriers in traditional III&#8211;V and II&#8211;VI semiconductors enforce low operating temperatures in the infrared photodetectors. Here we demonstrate infrared photodetection enabled by interlayer excitons (ILEs) generated between tungsten and hafnium disulfide, WS<sub>2</sub>/HfS<sub>2</sub>. The photodetector operates at room temperature and shows an even higher performance at higher temperatures owing to the large exciton binding energy and phonon-assisted optical transition. The unique band alignment in the WS<sub>2</sub>/HfS<sub>2</sub> heterostructure allows interlayer bandgap tuning from the mid- to long-wave infrared spectrum. We postulate that the sizeable charge delocalization and ILE accumulation at the interface result in a greatly enhanced oscillator strength of the ILEs and a high responsivity of the photodetector. The sensitivity of ILEs to the thickness of two-dimensional materials and the external field provides an excellent platform to realize robust tunable room temperature infrared photodetectors.</p>",[],False,"[""Steven Lukman"", ""Lu Ding"", ""Lei Xu"", ""Ye Tao"", ""Anders C.

article,Electrolyte gating in graphene-based supercapacitors and its use for probing nanoconfined charging dynamics,"<p>Graphene-based nanoporous materials have been extensively explored as high-capacity ion electrosorption electrodes for supercapacitors. However, little attention has been paid to exploiting the interactions between electrons that reside in the graphene lattice and the ions adsorbed between the individual graphene sheets. Here we report that the electronic conductance of a multilayered reduced graphene oxide membrane, when used as a supercapacitor electrode, can be modulated by the ionic charging state of the membrane, which gives rise to a collective electrolyte gating effect. This gating effect provides an in-operando approach for probing the charging dynamics of supercapacitors electrically. Using this approach, we observed a pore-size-dependent ionic hysteresis or memory effect in reduced graphene oxide membranes when the interlayer distance is comparable to the ion diameter.

article,In situ electrochemical generation of nitric oxide for neuronal modulation,"<p>Understanding the function of nitric oxide, a lipophilic messenger in physiological processes across nervous, cardiovascular and immune systems, is currently impeded by the dearth of tools to deliver this gaseous molecule in situ to specific cells. To address this need, we have developed iron sulfide nanoclusters that catalyse nitric oxide generation from benign sodium nitrite in the presence of modest electric fields. Locally generated nitric oxide activates the nitric oxide-sensitive cation channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid family member 1 (TRPV1), and the latency of TRPV1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses can be controlled by varying the applied voltage. Integrating these electrocatalytic nanoclusters with multimaterial fibres allows nitric oxide-mediated neuronal interrogation in vivo. The in situ generation of nitric oxide in the ventral tegmental area with the electrocatalytic fibres evoked neuronal excitation in the targeted brain region and its excitatory projections.

article,Subretinally injected semiconducting polymer nanoparticles rescue vision in a rat model of retinal dystrophy,"<p>Inherited retinal dystrophies and late-stage age-related macular degeneration, for which treatments remain limited, are among the most prevalent causes of legal blindness. Retinal prostheses have been developed to stimulate the inner retinal network; however, lack of sensitivity and resolution, and the need for wiring or external cameras, have limited their application. Here we show that conjugated polymer nanoparticles (P3HT NPs) mediate light-evoked stimulation of retinal neurons and persistently rescue visual functions when subretinally injected in a rat model of retinitis pigmentosa. P3HT NPs spread out over the entire subretinal space and promote light-dependent activation of spared inner retinal neurons, recovering subcortical, cortical and behavioural visual responses in the absence of trophic effects or retinal inflammation. By conferring sustained light sensitivity to degenerate retinas after a single injection, and with the potential for high spatial resolution, P3HT NPs provide a new avenue in retinal prosthetics with potential applications not only in retinitis pigmentosa, but also in age-related macular degeneration.</p>",[],False,"[""Jos\u00e9 Fernando Maya-Vetencourt"", ""Giovanni Manfredi"", ""Maurizio Mete"", ""Elisabetta Colombo"", ""Mattia Bramini"", ""Stefano Di Marco"", ""Dmytro Shmal"", ""Giulia Mantero"", ""Michele Dipalo"", ""Anna Rocchi"", ""Mattia L.

This is followed by a computationally powerful but simple molecular implementation scheme using DNA, as well as an effective in situ amplification and transformation method for miRNA enrichment in serum without perturbing the original variety and quantity information. We successfully achieved rapid and accurate cancer diagnosis using clinical serum samples from 22 healthy people (8) and people with lung cancer (14) with an accuracy of 86.4%.

However, the effects of antigen copy number, spacing and affinity, as well as the dimensionality and rigidity of scaffold presentation on B-cell activation remain poorly understood. Here, we display the clinical vaccine immunogen eOD-GT8, an engineered outer domain of the HIV-1 glycoprotein-120, on DNA origami nanoparticles to systematically interrogate the impact of these nanoscale parameters on B-cell activation in vitro. We find that B-cell signalling is maximized by as few as five antigens maximally spaced on the surface of a 40-nm viral-like nanoparticle. Increasing antigen spacing up to ~25&#8211;30&#8201;nm monotonically increases B-cell receptor activation. Moreover, scaffold rigidity is essential for robust B-cell triggering.
