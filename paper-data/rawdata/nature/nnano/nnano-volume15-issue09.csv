review article,Key principles and operational practices for improved nanotechnology environmental exposure assessment,"<p>Nanotechnology is identified as a key enabling technology due to its potential to contribute to economic growth and societal well-being across industrial sectors. Sustainable nanotechnology requires a scientifically based and proportionate risk governance structure to support innovation, including a robust framework for environmental risk assessment (ERA) that ideally builds on methods established for conventional chemicals to ensure alignment and avoid duplication. Exposure assessment developed as a tiered approach is equally beneficial to nano-specific ERA as for other classes of chemicals. Here we present the developing knowledge, practical considerations and key principles need to support exposure assessment for engineered nanomaterials for regulatory and research applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Claus Svendsen"", ""Lee A.

letter,Room-temperature valleytronic transistor,"<p>Valleytronics, based on the valley degree of freedom rather than charge, is a promising candidate for next-generation information devices beyond complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Although many intriguing valleytronic properties have been explored based on excitonic injection or the non-local response of transverse current schemes at low temperature, demonstrations of valleytronic building blocks similar to transistors in electronics, especially at room temperature, remain elusive. Here, we report a solid-state device that enables a full sequence of generating, propagating, detecting and manipulating valley information at room temperature. Chiral nanocrescent plasmonic antennae are used to selectively generate valley-polarized carriers in MoS<sub>2</sub> through hot-electron injection under linearly polarized infrared excitation. These long-lived valley-polarized free carriers can be detected in a valley Hall configuration even without charge current, and can propagate over 18&#8201;&#956;m by means of drift. In addition, electrostatic gating allows us to modulate the magnitude of the valley Hall voltage. The electrical valley Hall output could drive the valley manipulation of a cascaded stage, rendering the device able to serve as a transistor free of charge current with pure valleytronic input/output. Our results demonstrate the possibility of encoding and processing information by valley degree of freedom, and provide a universal strategy to study the Berry curvature dipole in quantum materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Lingfei Li"", ""Lei Shao"", ""Xiaowei Liu"", ""Anyuan Gao"", ""Hao Wang"", ""Binjie Zheng"", ""Guozhi Hou"", ""Khurram Shehzad"", ""Linwei Yu"", ""Feng Miao"", ""Yi Shi"", ""Yang Xu"", ""Xiaomu Wang""]","Li, L., Shao, L., Liu, X. et al.

letter,Broken mirror symmetry in excitonic response of reconstructed domains in twisted MoSe2/MoSe2 bilayers,"<p>Van der Waals heterostructures obtained via stacking and twisting have been used to create moir&#233; superlattices, enabling new optical and electronic properties in solid-state systems. Moir&#233; lattices in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) result in exciton trapping, host Mott insulating and superconducting states and act as unique Hubbard systems whose correlated electronic states can be detected and manipulated optically. Structurally, these twisted heterostructures feature atomic reconstruction and domain formation. However, due to the nanoscale size of moir&#233; domains, the effects of atomic reconstruction on the electronic and excitonic properties have not been systematically investigated. Here we use near-0&#176;-twist-angle MoSe<sub>2</sub>/MoSe<sub>2</sub> bilayers with large rhombohedral AB/BA domains to directly probe the excitonic properties of individual domains with far-field optics. We show that this system features broken mirror/inversion symmetry, with the AB and BA domains supporting interlayer excitons with out-of-plane electric dipole moments in opposite directions. The dipole orientation of ground-state &#915;&#8211;K interlayer excitons can be flipped with electric fields, while higher-energy K&#8211;K interlayer excitons undergo field-asymmetric hybridization with intralayer K&#8211;K excitons. Our study reveals the impact of crystal symmetry on TMD excitons and points to new avenues for realizing topologically non-trivial systems, exotic metasurfaces, collective excitonic phases and quantum emitter arrays via domain-pattern engineering.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiho Sung"", ""You Zhou"", ""Giovanni Scuri"", ""Viktor Z\u00f3lyomi"", ""Trond I.

letter,Differentially charged nanoplastics demonstrate distinct accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana,"<p>Although the fates of microplastics (0.1&#8211;5&#8201;mm in size) and nanoplastics (&lt;100&#8201;nm) in marine environments are being increasingly well studied, little is known about the behaviour of nanoplastics in terrestrial environments, especially agricultural soils. Previous studies have evaluated the consequences of nanoplastic accumulation in aquatic plants, but there is no direct evidence for the internalization of nanoplastics in terrestrial plants. Here, we show that both positively and negatively charged nanoplastics can accumulate in Arabidopsis thaliana. The aggregation promoted by the growth medium and root exudates limited the uptake of amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics with positive surface charges. Thus, positively charged nanoplastics accumulated at relatively low levels in the root tips, but these nanoplastics induced a higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species and inhibited plant growth and seedling development more strongly than negatively charged sulfonic-acid-modified nanoplastics. By contrast, the negatively charged nanoplastics were observed frequently in the apoplast and xylem. Our findings provide direct evidence that nanoplastics can accumulate in plants, depending on their surface charge. Plant accumulation of nanoplastics can have both direct ecological effects and implications for agricultural sustainability and food safety.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiao-Dong Sun"", ""Xian-Zheng Yuan"", ""Yuebin Jia"", ""Li-Juan Feng"", ""Fan-Ping Zhu"", ""Shang-Shang Dong"", ""Jiajia Liu"", ""Xiangpei Kong"", ""Huiyu Tian"", ""Jian-Lu Duan"", ""Zhaojun Ding"", ""Shu-Guang Wang"", ""Baoshan Xing""]","Sun, XD., Yuan, XZ., Jia, Y. et al.

article,Melting of a skyrmion lattice to a skyrmion liquid via a hexatic phase,"<p>The phase transition most commonly observed is probably melting, a transition from ordered crystalline solids to disordered isotropic liquids. In three dimensions, melting is a single, first-order phase transition. In two-dimensional systems, however, theory predicts a general scenario of two continuous phase transitions separated by an intermediate, oriented liquid state, the so-called hexatic phase with short-range translational and quasi-long-range orientational orders. Such hexatic phases occur in colloidal systems, Wigner solids and liquid crystals, all composed of real-matter particles. In contrast, skyrmions are countable soliton configurations with non-trivial topology and these quasi-particles can form two-dimensional lattices. Here we show, by direct imaging with cryo-Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, that magnetic field variations can tune the phase of the skyrmion ensembles in Cu<sub>2</sub>OSeO<sub>3</sub> from a two-dimensional solid through the long-speculated skyrmion hexatic phase to a liquid. The local spin order persists throughout the process. Remarkably, our quantitative analysis demonstrates that the aforementioned topological-defect-induced crystal melting scenario well describes the observed phase transitions.</p>",[],False,"[""Ping Huang"", ""Thomas Sch\u00f6nenberger"", ""Marco Cantoni"", ""Lukas Heinen"", ""Arnaud Magrez"", ""Achim Rosch"", ""Fabrizio Carbone"", ""Henrik M.

article,Probing photoelectrical transport in lead halide perovskites with van der Waals contacts,"<p>Lead halide perovskites have attracted increasing interest for their exciting potential in diverse optoelectronic devices. However, their charge transport properties remain elusive, plagued by the issues of excessive contact resistance and large hysteresis in ambient conditions. Here we report a van der Waals integration approach for creating high-performance contacts on monocrystalline halide perovskite thin films with minimum interfacial damage and an atomically clean interface. Compared to the deposited contacts, our van der Waals contacts exhibit two to three orders of magnitude lower contact resistance, enabling systematic transport studies in a wide temperature range. We report a Hall mobility exceeding 2,000&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>&#8201;V<sup>&#8211;1</sup>&#8201;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup> at around 80&#8201;K, an ultralow bimolecular recombination coefficient of 3.5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8211;15</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>3</sup>&#8201;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup> and a photocurrent gain &gt;10<sup>6</sup> in the perovskite thin films.

article,Power-efficient neural network with artificial dendrites,"<p>In the nervous system, dendrites, branches of neurons that transmit signals between synapses and soma, play a critical role in processing functions, such as nonlinear integration of postsynaptic signals. The lack of these critical functions in artificial neural networks compromises their performance, for example in terms of flexibility, energy efficiency and the ability to handle complex tasks. Here, by developing artificial dendrites, we experimentally demonstrate a complete neural network fully integrated with synapses, dendrites and soma, implemented using scalable memristor devices. We perform a digit recognition task and simulate a multilayer network using experimentally derived device characteristics. The power consumption is more than three orders of magnitude lower than that of a central processing unit and 70 times lower than that of a typical application-specific integrated circuit chip. This network, equipped with functional dendrites, shows the potential of substantial overall performance improvement, for example by extracting critical information from a noisy background with significantly reduced power consumption and enhanced accuracy.</p>",[],False,"[""Xinyi Li"", ""Jianshi Tang"", ""Qingtian Zhang"", ""Bin Gao"", ""J.

article,Programming multi-protein assembly by gene-brush patterns and two-dimensional compartment geometry,"<p>The assembly of protein machines in cells is precise, rapid, and coupled to protein synthesis with regulation in space and time. The assembly of natural and synthetic nanomachines could be similarly controlled by genetic programming outside the cell. Here, we present quasi-two-dimensional (2D) silicon compartments that enable programming of protein assembly lines by local synthesis from surface-immobilized DNA brushes. Using this platform, we studied the autonomous synthesis and assembly of a structural complex from a bacteriophage and a bacterial RNA-synthesizing machine. Local synthesis and surface capture of complexes provided high assembly yield and sensitive detection of spatially resolved assembly intermediates, with the 3D geometry of the compartment and the 2D pattern of brushes dictating the yield and mode of assembly steps. Localized synthesis of proteins in a single gene brush enhances their interactions, and displacement of their genes in separated brushes leads to step-by-step surface assembly.

However, few breath tests are currently used in the clinic to monitor disease due to bottlenecks in biomarker identification. Here we engineered breath biomarkers for respiratory disease by local delivery of protease-sensing nanoparticles to the lungs. The nanosensors shed volatile reporters upon cleavage by neutrophil elastase, an inflammation-associated protease with elevated activity in lung diseases such as bacterial infection and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. After intrapulmonary delivery into mouse models with acute lung inflammation, the volatile reporters are released and expelled in breath at levels detectable by mass spectrometry. These breath signals can identify diseased mice with high sensitivity as early as 10&#8201;min after nanosensor administration. Using these nanosensors, we performed serial breath tests to monitor dynamic changes in neutrophil elastase activity during lung infection and to assess the efficacy of a protease inhibitor therapy targeting neutrophil elastase for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.</p>",[],False,"[""Leslie W.

analysis,Guiding the design space for nanotechnology to advance sustainable crop production,"<p>The globally recognized need to advance more sustainable agriculture and food systems has motivated the emergence of transdisciplinary solutions, which include methodologies that utilize the properties of materials at the nanoscale to address extensive and inefficient resource use. Despite the promising prospects of these nanoscale materials, the potential for large-scale applications directly to the environment and to crops necessitates precautionary measures to avoid unintended consequences. Further, the effects of using engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in agricultural practices cascade throughout their life cycle and include effects from upstream-embodied resources and emissions from ENM production as well as their potential downstream environmental implications. Building on decades-long research in ENM synthesis, biological and environmental interactions, fate, transport and transformation, there is the opportunity to inform the sustainable design of nano-enabled agrochemicals. Here we perform a screening-level analysis that considers the system-wide benefits and costs for opportunities in which ENMs can advance the sustainability of crop-based agriculture. These include their on-farm use as (1) soil amendments to offset nitrogen fertilizer inputs, (2) seed coatings to increase germination rates and (3) foliar sprays to enhance yields. In each analysis, the nano-enabled alternatives are compared against the current practice on the basis of performance and embodied energy. In addition to identifying the ENM compositions and application approaches with the greatest potential to sustainably advance crop production, we present a holistic, prospective, systems-based approach that promotes emerging alternatives that have net performance and environmental benefits.</p>",[],False,"[""Leanne M.
