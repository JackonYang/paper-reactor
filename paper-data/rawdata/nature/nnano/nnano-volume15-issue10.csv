review article,A framework for designing delivery systems,"<p>The delivery of medical agents to a specific diseased tissue or cell is critical for diagnosing and treating patients. Nanomaterials are promising vehicles to transport agents that include drugs, contrast agents, immunotherapies and gene editors. They can be engineered to have different physical and chemical properties that influence their interactions with their biological environments and delivery destinations. In this Review Article, we discuss nanoparticle delivery systems and how the biology of disease should inform their design.

letter,Large non-reciprocal charge transport mediated by quantum anomalous Hall edge states,"<p>The topological nature of the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) causes a dissipationless chiral edge current at the sample boundary. Of fundamental interest is whether the chirality of the band structure manifests itself in charge transport properties. Here we report the observation of large non-reciprocal charge transport in a magnetic topological insulator, Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>. When the surface massive Dirac band is slightly carrier doped by a gate voltage, the edge state starts to dissipate and exhibits a current-direction-dependent resistance with a directional difference as large as 26%. The polarity of this diode effect depends on the magnetization direction as well as on the carrier type, electrons or holes. The correlation between the non-reciprocal resistance and the Hall resistance indicates that the non-reciprocity originates from the interplay between the chiral edge state and the Dirac surface state.</p>",[],False,"[""Kenji Yasuda"", ""Takahiro Morimoto"", ""Ryutaro Yoshimi"", ""Masataka Mogi"", ""Atsushi Tsukazaki"", ""Minoru Kawamura"", ""Kei S.

letter,Backbone charge transport in double-stranded DNA,"<p>Understanding charge transport in DNA molecules is a long-standing problem of fundamental importance across disciplines. It is also of great technological interest due to DNA&#8217;s ability to form versatile and complex programmable structures. Charge transport in DNA-based junctions has been reported using a wide variety of set-ups, but experiments so far have yielded seemingly contradictory results that range from insulating or semiconducting to metallic-like behaviour. As a result, the intrinsic charge transport mechanism in molecular junction set-ups is not well understood, which is mainly due to the lack of techniques to form reproducible and stable contacts with individual long DNA molecules. Here we report charge-transport measurements through single 30-nm-long double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules with an experimental set-up that enables us to address individual molecules repeatedly and to measure the current&#8211;voltage characteristics from 5&#8201;K up to room temperature. Strikingly, we observed very high currents of tens of nanoamperes, which flowed through both homogeneous and non-homogeneous base-pair sequences. The currents are fairly temperature independent in the range 5&#8211;60&#8201;K and show a power-law decrease with temperature above 60&#8201;K, which is reminiscent of charge transport in organic crystals. Moreover, we show that the presence of even a single discontinuity (&#8216;nick&#8217;) in both strands that compose the dsDNA leads to complete suppression of the current, which suggests that the backbones mediate the long-distance conduction in dsDNA, contrary to the common wisdom in DNA electronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Roman Zhuravel"", ""Haichao Huang"", ""Georgia Polycarpou"", ""Savvas Polydorides"", ""Phani Motamarri"", ""Liat Katrivas"", ""Dvir Rotem"", ""Joseph Sperling"", ""Linda A.

letter,Biomolecular condensates undergo a generic shear-mediated liquid-to-solid transition,"<p>Membrane-less organelles resulting from liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of biopolymers into intracellular condensates control essential biological functions, including messenger RNA processing, cell signalling and embryogenesis. It has recently been discovered that several such protein condensates can undergo a further irreversible phase transition, forming solid nanoscale aggregates associated with neurodegenerative disease. While the irreversible gelation of protein condensates is generally related to malfunction and disease, one case where the liquid-to-solid transition of protein condensates is functional, however, is that of silk spinning. The formation of silk fibrils is largely driven by shear, yet it is not known what factors control the pathological gelation of functional condensates. Here we demonstrate that four proteins and one peptide system, with no function associated with fibre formation, have a strong propensity to undergo a liquid-to-solid transition when exposed to even low levels of mechanical shear once present in their liquid&#8211;liquid phase separated form. Using microfluidics to control the application of shear, we generated fibres from single-protein condensates and characterized their structural and material properties as a function of shear stress. Our results reveal generic backbone&#8211;backbone hydrogen bonding constraints as a determining factor in governing this transition. These observations suggest that shear can play an important role in the irreversible liquid-to-solid transition of protein condensates, shed light on the role of physical factors in driving this transition in protein aggregation-related diseases and open a new route towards artificial shear responsive biomaterials.</p>",[],False,"[""Yi Shen"", ""Francesco Simone Ruggeri"", ""Daniele Vigolo"", ""Ayaka Kamada"", ""Seema Qamar"", ""Aviad Levin"", ""Christiane Iserman"", ""Simon Alberti"", ""Peter St George-Hyslop"", ""Tuomas P.

letter,Facet engineering accelerates spillover hydrogenation on highly diluted metal nanocatalysts,"<p>Hydrogen spillover is a well-known phenomenon in heterogeneous catalysis; it involves H<sub>2</sub> cleavage on an active metal followed by the migration of dissociated H species over an &#8216;inert&#8217; support. Although catalytic hydrogenation using the spilled H species, namely, spillover hydrogenation, has long been proposed, very limited knowledge has been obtained about what kind of support structure is required to achieve spillover hydrogenation. By dispersing Pd atoms onto Cu nanomaterials with different exposed facets, Cu(111) and Cu(100), we demonstrate in this work that while the hydrogen spillover from Pd to Cu is facet independent, the spillover hydrogenation only occurs on Pd<sub>1</sub>/Cu(100), where the hydrogen atoms spilled from Pd are readily utilized for the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes. This work thus helps to create an effective method for fabricating cost-effective nanocatalysts with an extremely low Pd loading, at the level of 50&#8201;ppm, toward the semi-hydrogenation of a broad range of alkynes with extremely high activity and selectivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Lizhi Jiang"", ""Kunlong Liu"", ""Sung-Fu Hung"", ""Lingyun Zhou"", ""Ruixuan Qin"", ""Qinghua Zhang"", ""Pengxin Liu"", ""Lin Gu"", ""Hao Ming Chen"", ""Gang Fu"", ""Nanfeng Zheng""]","Jiang, L., Liu, K., Hung, SF. et al.

article,Imaging strain-localized excitons in nanoscale bubbles of monolayer WSe2 at room temperature,"<p>In monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, localized strain can be used to design nanoarrays of single photon sources. Despite strong empirical correlation, the nanoscale interplay between excitons and local crystalline structure that gives rise to these quantum emitters is poorly understood. Here, we combine room-temperature nano-optical imaging and spectroscopic analysis of excitons in nanobubbles of monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> with atomistic models to study how strain induces nanoscale confinement potentials and localized exciton states. The imaging of nanobubbles in monolayers with low defect concentrations reveals localized excitons on length scales of around 10&#8201;nm at multiple sites around the periphery of individual nanobubbles, in stark contrast to predictions of continuum models of strain. These results agree with theoretical confinement potentials atomistically derived from the measured topographies of nanobubbles.

article,Layer-controlled single-crystalline graphene film with stacking order via Cu–Si alloy formation,"<p>Multilayer graphene and its stacking order provide both fundamentally intriguing properties and technological engineering applications. Several approaches to control the stacking order have been demonstrated, but a method of precisely controlling the number of layers with desired stacking sequences is still lacking. Here, we propose an approach for controlling the layer thickness and crystallographic stacking sequence of multilayer graphene films at the wafer scale via Cu&#8211;Si alloy formation using direct chemical vapour deposition. C atoms are introduced by tuning the ultra-low-limit CH<sub>4</sub> concentration to form a SiC layer, reaching one to four graphene layers at the wafer scale after Si sublimation. The crystallographic structure of single-crystalline or uniformly oriented bilayer (AB), trilayer (ABA) and tetralayer (ABCA) graphene are determined via nano-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which agrees with theoretical calculations, Raman spectroscopy and transport measurements.

article,Enhanced catalytic activity under non-equilibrium conditions,"<p>The development of non-equilibrium synthetic systems provides access to innovative materials with life-like properties. Non-equilibrium systems require a continuous input of energy to retain their functional state, which makes for a fundamental difference to systems that operate at thermodynamic equilibrium. Kinetic asymmetry in the energy consumption pathway is required to drive systems out of equilibrium. This understanding has permitted chemists to design dissipative synthetic molecular machines and high-energy materials. Here we show that kinetic asymmetry also emerges at the macroscopic level by demonstrating that local energy delivery in the form of light to a hydrogel containing gold nanoparticles installs a non-equilibrium steady state. The instalment and maintenance of the macroscopic non-equilibrium state is facilitated by the gel matrix in which motion is governed by diffusion rather than convection. The non-equilibrium state is characterized by a persistent gradient in the surface composition of the nanoparticles embedded in the gel, which affects the fluorescent and catalytic properties of the system. We show that the overall catalytic performance of the system is enhanced under these non-equilibrium conditions. In perspective it will be possible to develop out-of-equilibrium matrices in which functional properties emerge as a result of spatially controlled energy delivery and spatially controlled chemistries.</p>",[],False,"[""Rui Chen"", ""Simona Neri"", ""Leonard J.

The scientific and technological challenges associated with the fabrication and utilization of nanoscale metallic glasses, however, remain unresolved. Here, we present a simple and scalable approach for the fabrication of metallic glass fibres with nanoscale architectures based on their thermal co-drawing within a polymer matrix with matched rheological properties.

We combine fluid dynamics and advanced in situ transmission electron microscopy analysis to elucidate the interplay between fluid instability and crystallization kinetics that determines the achievable feature sizes. Our approach yields complex fibre architectures that, combined with other functional materials, enable new advanced all-in-fibre devices.

In this work, we use in-situ <sup>23</sup>Na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, along with an innovative analytical approach, to provide space-resolved and quantitative insights into the formation and evolution of sodium metal microstructures (SMSs; that is, dendritic and mossy Na metal) during the deposition and stripping processes. Our results reveal that the growing SMSs give rise to a linear increase in the overpotential until a transition voltage of 0.15&#8201;V is reached, at which point violent electrochemical decomposition of the electrolyte is triggered, leading to the formation of mossy-type SMSs and rapid battery failure. In addition, we determined the existence of NaH in the SEI on sodium metal with ex-situ NMR results.
