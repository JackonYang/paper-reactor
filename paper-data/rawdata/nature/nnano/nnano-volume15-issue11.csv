letter,Relation between microscopic interactions and macroscopic properties in ferroics,"<p>The driving force in materials to spontaneously form states with magnetic or electric order is of fundamental importance for basic research and device technology. The macroscopic properties and functionalities of these ferroics depend on the size, distribution and morphology of domains; that is, of regions across which such uniform order is maintained. Typically, extrinsic factors such as strain profiles, grain size or annealing procedures control the size and shape of the domains, whereas intrinsic parameters are often difficult to extract due to the complexity of a processed material. Here, we achieve this separation by building artificial crystals of planar nanomagnets that are coupled by well-defined, tuneable and competing magnetic interactions. Aside from analysing the domain configurations, we uncover fundamental intrinsic correlations between the microscopic interactions establishing magnetically compensated order and the macroscopic manifestations of these interactions in basic physical properties. Experiment and simulations reveal how competing interactions can be exploited to control ferroic hallmark properties such as the size and morphology of domains, topological properties of domain walls or their thermal mobility.</p>",[],False,"[""Jannis Lehmann"", ""Amad\u00e9 Bortis"", ""Peter M.

letter,Giant Stark splitting of an exciton in bilayer MoS2,"<p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) constitute a versatile platform for atomically thin optoelectronics devices and spin&#8211;valley memory applications. In monolayer TMDs the optical absorption is strong, but the transition energy cannot be tuned as the neutral exciton has essentially no out-of-plane static electric dipole. In contrast, interlayer exciton transitions in heterobilayers are widely tunable in applied electric fields, but their coupling to light is substantially reduced. In this work, we show tuning over 120&#8201;meV of interlayer excitons with a high oscillator strength in bilayer MoS<sub>2</sub> due to the quantum-confined Stark effect. We optically probed the interaction between intra- and interlayer excitons as they were energetically tuned into resonance. Interlayer excitons interact strongly with intralayer B excitons, as demonstrated by a clear avoided crossing, whereas the interaction with intralayer A excitons is substantially weaker. Our observations are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which include excitonic effects. In MoS<sub>2</sub> trilayers, our experiments uncovered two types of interlayer excitons with and without in-built electric dipoles. Highly tunable excitonic transitions with large in-built dipoles and oscillator strengths will result in strong exciton&#8211;exciton interactions and therefore hold great promise for non-linear optics with polaritons.</p>",[],False,"[""Nadine Leisgang"", ""Shivangi Shree"", ""Ioannis Paradisanos"", ""Lukas Sponfeldner"", ""Cedric Robert"", ""Delphine Lagarde"", ""Andrea Balocchi"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Xavier Marie"", ""Richard J.

letter,Stand-off trapping and manipulation of sub-10 nm objects and biomolecules using opto-thermo-electrohydrodynamic tweezers,"<p>Optical tweezers have emerged as a powerful tool for the non-invasive trapping and manipulation of colloidal particles and biological cells. However, the diffraction limit precludes the low-power trapping of nanometre-scale objects. Substantially increasing the laser power can provide enough trapping potential depth to trap nanoscale objects. Unfortunately, the substantial optical intensity required causes photo-toxicity and thermal stress in the trapped biological specimens. Low-power near-field nano-optical tweezers comprising plasmonic nanoantennas and photonic crystal cavities have been explored for stable nanoscale object trapping. However, the demonstrated approaches still require that the object is trapped at the high-light-intensity region. We report a new kind of optically controlled nanotweezers, called opto-thermo-electrohydrodynamic tweezers, that enable the trapping and dynamic manipulation of nanometre-scale objects at locations that are several micrometres away from the high-intensity laser focus. At the trapping locations, the nanoscale objects experience both negligible photothermal heating and light intensity. Opto-thermo-electrohydrodynamic tweezers employ a finite array of plasmonic nanoholes illuminated with light and an applied a.c. electric field to create the spatially varying electrohydrodynamic potential that can rapidly trap sub-10&#8201;nm biomolecules at femtomolar concentrations on demand. This non-invasive optical nanotweezing approach is expected to open new opportunities in nanoscience and life science by offering an unprecedented level of control of nano-sized objects, including photo-sensitive biological molecules.</p>",[],False,"[""Chuchuan Hong"", ""Sen Yang"", ""Justus C.

letter,Functional and morphological adaptation in DNA protocells via signal processing prompted by artificial metalloenzymes,"<p>For life to emerge, the confinement of catalytic reactions within protocellular environments has been proposed to be a decisive aspect to regulate chemical activity in space. Today, cells and organisms adapt to signals by processing them through reaction networks that ultimately provide downstream functional responses and structural morphogenesis. Re-enacting such signal processing in de novo-designed protocells is a profound challenge, but of high importance for understanding the design of adaptive systems with life-like traits. We report on engineered all-DNA protocells harbouring an artificial metalloenzyme whose olefin metathesis activity leads to downstream morphogenetic protocellular responses with varying levels of complexity. The artificial metalloenzyme catalyses the uncaging of a pro-fluorescent signal molecule that generates a self-reporting fluorescent metabolite designed to weaken DNA duplex interactions. This leads to pronounced growth, intraparticular functional adaptation in the presence of a fluorescent DNA mechanosensor or interparticle protocell fusion. Such processes mimic chemically transduced processes found in cell adaptation and cell-to-cell adhesion. Our concept showcases new opportunities to study life-like behaviour via abiotic bioorthogonal chemical and mechanical transformations in synthetic protocells. Furthermore, it reveals a strategy for inducing complex behaviour in adaptive and communicating soft-matter microsystems, and it illustrates how dynamic properties can be upregulated and sustained in micro-compartmentalized media.</p>",[],False,"[""Avik Samanta"", ""Valerio Sabatino"", ""Thomas R.

letter,Observation of inhomogeneous plasmonic field distribution in a nanocavity,"<p>The progress of plasmon-based technologies relies on an understanding of the properties of the enhanced electromagnetic fields generated by the coupling nanostrucutres. Plasmon-enhanced applications include advanced spectroscopies, optomechanics, optomagnetics and biosensing. However, precise determination of plasmon field intensity distribution within a nanogap remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a molecular ruler made from a set of viologen-based, self-assembly monolayers with which we precisely measures field distribution within a plasmon nanocavity with ~2-&#197; spatial resolution. We observed an unusually large plasmon field intensity inhomogeneity that we attribute to the formation of a plasmonic comb in the nanocavity. As a consequence, we posit that the generally adopted continuous media approximation for molecular monolayers should be used carefully.</p>",[],False,"[""Chao-Yu Li"", ""Sai Duan"", ""Bao-Ying Wen"", ""Song-Bo Li"", ""Murugavel Kathiresan"", ""Li-Qiang Xie"", ""Shu Chen"", ""Jason R.

article,Photonic Rashba effect from quantum emitters mediated by a Berry-phase defective photonic crystal,"<p>Heterostructures combining a thin layer of quantum emitters and planar nanostructures enable custom-tailored photoluminescence in an integrated fashion. Here, we demonstrate a photonic Rashba effect from valley excitons in a WSe<sub>2</sub> monolayer, which is incorporated into a photonic crystal slab with geometric phase defects, that is, into a Berry-phase defective photonic crystal. This phenomenon of spin-split dispersion in momentum space arises from a coherent geometric phase pickup assisted by the Berry-phase defect mode. The valley excitons effectively interact with the defects for site-controlled excitation, photoluminescence enhancement and spin-dependent manipulation. Specifically, the spin-dependent branches of photoluminescence in momentum space originate from valley excitons with opposite helicities and evidence the valley separation at room temperature. To further demonstrate the versatility of the Berry-phase defective photonic crystals, we use this concept to separate opposite spin states of quantum dot emission. This spin-enabled manipulation of quantum emitters may enable highly efficient metasurfaces for customized planar sources with spin-polarized directional emission.</p>",[],False,"[""Kexiu Rong"", ""Bo Wang"", ""Avi Reuven"", ""Elhanan Maguid"", ""Bar Cohn"", ""Vladimir Kleiner"", ""Shaul Katznelson"", ""Elad Koren"", ""Erez Hasman""]","Rong, K., Wang, B., Reuven, A. et al.

article,2D metal–organic framework for stable perovskite solar cells with minimized lead leakage,"<p>Despite the notable progress in perovskite solar cells, maintaining long-term operational stability and minimizing potentially leaked lead (Pb<sup>2+</sup>) ions are two challenges that are yet to be resolved. Here we address these issues using a thiol-functionalized 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework as an electron-extraction layer at the perovskite/cathode interface. The resultant devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency (22.02%) along with a substantially improved long-term operational stability. The perovskite solar cell modified with a metal&#8211;organic framework could retain more than 90% of its initial efficiency under accelerated testing conditions, that is continuous light irradiation at maximum power point tracking for 1,000&#8201;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C. More importantly, the functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework could capture most of the Pb<sup>2+</sup> leaked from the degraded perovskite solar cells by forming water-insoluble solids. Therefore, this method that simultaneously tackles the operational stability and lead contamination issues in perovskite solar cells could greatly improve the feasibility of large-scale deployment of perovskite photovoltaic technology.</p>",[],False,"[""Shengfan Wu"", ""Zhen Li"", ""Mu-Qing Li"", ""Yingxue Diao"", ""Francis Lin"", ""Tiantian Liu"", ""Jie Zhang"", ""Peter Tieu"", ""Wenpei Gao"", ""Feng Qi"", ""Xiaoqing Pan"", ""Zhengtao Xu"", ""Zonglong Zhu"", ""Alex K.-Y.

article,A rewritable optical storage medium of silk proteins using near-field nano-optics,"<p>Nanoscale lithography and information storage in biocompatible materials offer possibilities for applications such as bioelectronics and degradable electronics for which traditional semiconductor fabrication techniques cannot be used. Silk fibroin, a natural protein renowned for its strength and biocompatibility, has been widely studied in this context. Here, we present the use of silk film as a biofunctional medium for nanolithography and data storage. Using tip-enhanced near-field infrared nanolithography, we demonstrate versatile manipulation and characterize the topography and conformation of the silk in situ. In particular, we fabricate greyscale and dual-tone nanopatterns with full-width at half-maximum resolutions of ~35&#8201;nm, creating an erasable &#8216;silk drive&#8217; that digital data can be written to or read from. As an optical storage medium, the silk drive can store digital and biological information with a capacity of ~64&#8201;GB&#8201;inch<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and exhibits long-term stability under various harsh conditions. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we show that this silk drive can be biofunctionalized to exhibit chromogenic reactions, resistance to bacterial infection and heat-triggered, enzyme-assisted decomposition.</p>",[],False,"[""Woonsoo Lee"", ""Zhitao Zhou"", ""Xinzhong Chen"", ""Nan Qin"", ""Jianjuan Jiang"", ""Keyin Liu"", ""Mengkun Liu"", ""Tiger H.

article,Complex-amplitude metasurface-based orbital angular momentum holography in momentum space,"<p>Digital optical holograms can achieve nanometre-scale resolution as a result of recent advances in metasurface technologies. This has raised hopes for applications in data encryption, data storage, information processing and displays. However, the hologram bandwidth has remained too low for any practical use. To overcome this limitation, information can be stored in the orbital angular momentum of light, as this degree of freedom has an unbounded set of orthogonal helical modes that could function as information channels. Thus far, orbital angular momentum holography has been achieved using phase-only metasurfaces, which, however, are marred by channel crosstalk. As a result, multiplex information from only four channels has been demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate an orbital angular momentum holography technology that is capable of multiplexing up to 200 independent orbital angular momentum channels. This has been achieved by designing a complex-amplitude metasurface in momentum space capable of complete and independent amplitude and phase manipulation. Information was then extracted by Fourier transform using different orbital angular momentum modes of light, allowing lensless reconstruction and holographic videos to be displayed. Our metasurface can be three-dimensionally printed in a polymer matrix on SiO<sub>2</sub> for large-area fabrication.</p>",[],False,"[""Haoran Ren"", ""Xinyuan Fang"", ""Jaehyuck Jang"", ""Johannes B\u00fcrger"", ""Junsuk Rho"", ""Stefan A.

However, as the dimensions of dielectric cavities are reduced to subwavelength scales, their resonant modes begin to scatter light into many spatial channels. Such enhanced scattering is a powerful tool for light manipulation, but also leads to high radiative loss rates and commensurately low Q-factors, generally of order ten. Here, we describe and experimentally demonstrate a strategy for the generation of high Q-factor resonances in subwavelength-thick phase gradient metasurfaces. By including subtle structural perturbations in individual metasurface elements, resonances are created that weakly couple free-space light into otherwise bound and spatially localized modes. Our metasurface can achieve Q-factors &gt;2,500 while beam steering light to particular directions. High-Q beam splitters are also demonstrated. With high-Q metasurfaces, the optical transfer function, near-field intensity and resonant line shape can all be rationally designed, providing a foundation for efficient, free-space-reconfigurable and nonlinear nanophotonics.</p>",[],False,"[""Mark Lawrence"", ""David R.
