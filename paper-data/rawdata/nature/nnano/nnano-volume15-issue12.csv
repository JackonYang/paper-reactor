review article,Semiconductor physics of organic–inorganic 2D halide perovskites,"<p>Achieving technologically relevant performance and stability for optoelectronics, energy conversion, photonics, spintronics and quantum devices requires creating atomically precise materials with tailored homo- and hetero-interfaces, which can form functional hierarchical assemblies. Nature employs tunable sequence chemistry to create complex architectures, which efficiently transform matter and energy, however, in contrast, the design of synthetic materials and their integration remains a long-standing challenge. Organic&#8211;inorganic two-dimensional halide perovskites (2DPKs) are organic and inorganic two-dimensional layers, which self-assemble in solution to form highly ordered periodic stacks. They exhibit a large compositional and structural phase space, which has led to novel and exciting physical properties. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding in the structure and physical properties of 2DPKs from the monolayers to assemblies, and present a comprehensive comparison with conventional semiconductors, thereby providing a broad understanding of low-dimensional semiconductors that feature complex organic&#8211;inorganic hetero-interfaces.</p>",[],False,"[""Jean-Christophe Blancon"", ""Jacky Even"", ""Costas.

letter,Optical fibres with embedded two-dimensional materials for ultrahigh nonlinearity,"<p>Nonlinear optical fibres have been employed for a vast number of applications, including optical frequency conversion, ultrafast laser and optical communication. In current manufacturing technologies, nonlinearity is realized by the injection of nonlinear materials into fibres or the fabrication of microstructured fibres. Both strategies, however, suffer from either low optical nonlinearity or poor design flexibility. Here, we report the direct growth of MoS<sub>2</sub>, a highly nonlinear two-dimensional material, onto the internal walls of a SiO<sub>2</sub> optical fibre. This growth is realized via a two-step chemical vapour deposition method, where a solid precursor is pre-deposited to guarantee a homogeneous feedstock before achieving uniform two-dimensional material growth along the entire fibre walls. By using the as-fabricated 25-cm-long fibre, both second- and third-harmonic generation could be enhanced by ~300 times compared with monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>/silica. Propagation losses remain at ~0.1&#8201;dB&#8201;cm<sup>&#8211;1</sup> for a wide frequency range. In addition, we demonstrate an all-fibre mode-locked laser (~6&#8201;mW output, ~500&#8201;fs pulse width and ~41&#8201;MHz repetition rate) by integrating the two-dimensional-material-embedded optical fibre as a saturable absorber. Initial tests show that our fabrication strategy is amenable to other transition metal dichalcogenides, making these embedded fibres versatile for several all-fibre nonlinear optics and optoelectronics applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Yonggang Zuo"", ""Wentao Yu"", ""Can Liu"", ""Xu Cheng"", ""Ruixi Qiao"", ""Jing Liang"", ""Xu Zhou"", ""Jinhuan Wang"", ""Muhong Wu"", ""Yun Zhao"", ""Peng Gao"", ""Shiwei Wu"", ""Zhipei Sun"", ""Kaihui Liu"", ""Xuedong Bai"", ""Zhongfan Liu""]","Zuo, Y., Yu, W., Liu, C. et al.

article,A deep-learning approach to realizing functionality in nanoelectronic devices,"<p>Many nanoscale devices require precise optimization to function. Tuning them to the desired operation regime becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming when the number of terminals and couplings grows. Imperfections and device-to-device variations hinder optimization that uses physics-based models. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can model various complex physical phenomena but, so far, are mainly used as predictive tools. Here, we propose a generic deep-learning approach to efficiently optimize complex, multi-terminal nanoelectronic devices for desired functionality. We demonstrate our approach for realizing functionality in a disordered network of dopant atoms in silicon. We model the input&#8211;output characteristics of the device with a DNN, and subsequently optimize control parameters in the DNN model through gradient descent to realize various classification tasks. When the corresponding control settings are applied to the physical device, the resulting functionality is as predicted by the DNN model. We expect our approach to contribute to fast, in situ optimization of complex (quantum) nanoelectronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Hans-Christian Ruiz Euler"", ""Marcus N. Boon"", ""Jochem T.

article,Nuclear spin quantum register in an optically active semiconductor quantum dot,"<p>Epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) have long been identified as promising charge spin qubits offering an efficient interface to quantum light and advanced semiconductor nanofabrication technologies. However, charge spin coherence is limited by interaction with the nanoscale ensemble of atomic nuclear spins, which is particularly problematic in strained self-assembled dots. Here, we use strain-free GaAs/AlGaAs QDs, demonstrating a fully functioning two-qubit quantum register using the nanoscale ensemble of arsenic quadrupolar nuclear spins as its hardware. Tailored radio-frequency pulses allow quantum state storage for up to 20&#8201;ms, and are used for few-microsecond single-qubit and two-qubit control gates with fidelities exceeding 97%. Combining long coherence and high-fidelity control with optical initialization and readout, we implement benchmark quantum computations such as Grover&#8217;s search and the Deutsch&#8211;Jozsa algorithm. Our results identify QD nuclei as a potential quantum information resource, which can complement charge spins and light particles in future QD circuits.</p>",[],False,"[""Evgeny A.

article,Surface-enhanced Raman scattering holography,"<p>Nanometric probes based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are promising candidates for all-optical environmental, biological and technological sensing applications with intrinsic quantitative molecular specificity. However, the effectiveness of SERS probes depends on a delicate trade-off between particle size, stability and brightness that has so far hindered their wide application in SERS imaging methodologies. In this Article, we introduce holographic Raman microscopy, which allows single-shot three-dimensional single-particle localization. We validate our approach by simultaneously performing Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy of individual SERS nanoparticles and Raman holography, using shearing interferometry to extract both the phase and the amplitude of wide-field Raman images and ultimately localize and track single SERS nanoparticles inside living cells in three dimensions. Our results represent a step towards multiplexed single-shot three-dimensional concentration mapping in many different scenarios, including live cell and tissue interrogation and complex anti-counterfeiting applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Matz Liebel"", ""Nicolas Pazos-Perez"", ""Niek F. van Hulst"", ""Ramon A.

article,Dirac-vortex topological cavities,"<p>Cavity design is crucial for single-mode semiconductor lasers such as the ubiquitous distributed feedback and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. By recognizing that both of these optical resonators feature a single mid-gap mode localized at a topological defect in the one-dimensional lattice, we upgrade this topological cavity design concept into two dimensions using a honeycomb photonic crystal with a vortex Dirac gap by applying the generalized Kekul&#233; modulations. We theoretically predict and experimentally show on a silicon-on-insulator platform that the Dirac-vortex cavities have scalable mode areas, arbitrary mode degeneracies, vector-beam vertical emission and compatibility with high-index substrates. Moreover, we demonstrate the unprecedentedly large free spectral range, which defies the universal inverse relation between resonance spacing and resonator size.

article,A Gd@C82 single-molecule electret,"<p>Electrets are dielectric materials that have a quasi-permanent dipole polarization. A single-molecule electret is a long-sought-after nanoscale component because it can lead to miniaturized non-volatile memory storage devices. The signature of a single-molecule electret is the switching between two electric dipole states by an external electric field. The existence of these electrets has remained controversial because of the poor electric dipole stability in single molecules. Here we report the observation of a gate-controlled switching between two electronic states in Gd@C<sub>82</sub>. The encapsulated Gd atom forms a charged centre that sets up two single-electron transport channels. A gate voltage of &#177;11&#8201;V (corresponding to a coercive field of ~50&#8201;mV&#8201;&#197;<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) switches the system between the two transport channels with a ferroelectricity-like hysteresis loop. Using density functional theory, we assign the two states to two different permanent electrical dipole orientations generated from the Gd atom being trapped at two different sites inside the C<sub>82</sub> cage. The two dipole states are separated by a transition energy barrier of 11&#8201;meV. The conductance switching is then attributed to the electric-field-driven reorientation of the individual dipole, as the coercive field provides the necessary energy to overcome the transition barrier.</p>",[],False,"[""Kangkang Zhang"", ""Cong Wang"", ""Minhao Zhang"", ""Zhanbin Bai"", ""Fang-Fang Xie"", ""Yuan-Zhi Tan"", ""Yilv Guo"", ""Kuo-Juei Hu"", ""Lu Cao"", ""Shuai Zhang"", ""Xuecou Tu"", ""Danfeng Pan"", ""Lin Kang"", ""Jian Chen"", ""Peiheng Wu"", ""Xuefeng Wang"", ""Jinlan Wang"", ""Junming Liu"", ""You Song"", ""Guanghou Wang"", ""Fengqi Song"", ""Wei Ji"", ""Su-Yuan Xie"", ""Su-Fei Shi"", ""Mark A.

Here we report a successful effort to grow in situ a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanocoating on a stainless-steel wire cloth (hBN-SSWC), and its application as a scalable electrothermal heating material in surface heating membrane distillation. The novel hBN-SSWC provides superior vapour permeability, thermal conductivity, electrical insulation and anticorrosion properties, all of which are critical for the long-term surface heating membrane distillation performance, particularly with hypersaline solutions. By simply attaching hBN-SSWC to a commercial membrane and providing power with an a.c. supply at household frequency, we demonstrate that hBN-SSWC is able to support an ultrahigh power intensity (50&#8201;kW&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) to desalinate hypersaline solutions with exceptionally high water flux (and throughput), single-pass water recovery and heat utilization efficiency while maintaining excellent material stability.

An ab initio thermodynamics approach modelled how material morphology and matrix effects control the nutrient release. Infection reduced the biomass and photosynthesis by 70.3 and 60%, respectively; the foliar application of nanoscale Cu reversed this damage. Disease-induced changes in the antioxidant enzyme activity and fatty acid profile were also alleviated by Cu amendment. The transcription of two dozen defence- and health-related genes correlates a nanoscale Cu-enhanced innate disease response to reduced pathogenicity and increased growth. Cu-based nanosheets exhibited a greater disease suppression than that of CuO nanoparticles due to a greater leaf surface affinity and Cu dissolution, as determined computationally and experimentally. The findings highlight the importance and tunability of nanomaterial properties, such as morphology, composition and dissolution.

article,A general strategy towards personalized nanovaccines based on fluoropolymers for post-surgical cancer immunotherapy,"<p>Cancer metastases and recurrence after surgical resection remain an important cause of treatment failure. Here we demonstrate a general strategy to fabricate personalized nanovaccines based on a cationic fluoropolymer for post-surgical cancer immunotherapy. Nanoparticles formed by mixing the fluoropolymer with a model antigen ovalbumin, induce dendritic cell maturation via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated signalling pathway, and promote antigen transportation into the cytosol of dendritic cells, which leads to an effective antigen cross-presentation. Such a nanovaccine inhibits established ovalbumin-expressing B16-OVA melanoma. More importantly, a mix of the fluoropolymer with cell membranes from resected autologous primary tumours synergizes with checkpoint blockade therapy to inhibit post-surgical tumour recurrence and metastases in two subcutaneous tumour models and an orthotopic breast cancer tumour. Furthermore, in the orthotopic tumour model, we observed a strong immune memory against tumour rechallenge.

article,Proton-driven transformable nanovaccine for cancer immunotherapy,"<p>Cancer vaccines hold great promise for improved cancer treatment. However, endosomal trapping and low immunogenicity of tumour antigens usually limit the efficiency of vaccination strategies. Here, we present a proton-driven nanotransformer-based vaccine, comprising a polymer&#8211;peptide conjugate-based nanotransformer and loaded antigenic peptide. The nanotransformer-based vaccine induces a strong immune response without substantial systemic toxicity. In the acidic endosomal environment, the nanotransformer-based vaccine undergoes a dramatic morphological change from nanospheres (about 100&#8201;nanometres in diameter) into nanosheets (several micrometres in length or width), which mechanically disrupts the endosomal membrane and directly delivers the antigenic peptide into the cytoplasm. The re-assembled nanosheets also boost tumour immunity via activation of specific inflammation pathways. The nanotransformer-based vaccine effectively inhibits tumour growth in the B16F10-OVA and human papilloma virus-E6/E7 tumour models in mice. Moreover, combining the nanotransformer-based vaccine with anti-PD-L1 antibodies results in over 83 days of survival and in about half of the mice produces complete tumour regression in the B16F10 model.
