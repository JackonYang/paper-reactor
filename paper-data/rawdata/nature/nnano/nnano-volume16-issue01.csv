review article,Eliciting B cell immunity against infectious diseases using nanovaccines,"<p>Infectious diseases, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has brought the world to a standstill, are emerging at an unprecedented rate with a substantial impact on public health and global economies. For many life-threatening global infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, malaria and influenza, effective vaccinations are still lacking. There are numerous roadblocks to developing new vaccines, including a limited understanding of immune correlates of protection to these global infections. To induce a reproducible, strong immune response against difficult pathogens, sophisticated nanovaccine technologies are under investigation. In contrast to conventional vaccines, nanovaccines provide improved access to lymph nodes, optimal packing and presentation of antigens, and induction of a persistent immune response. This Review provides a perspective on the global trends in emerging nanoscale vaccines for infectious diseases and describes the biological, experimental and logistical problems associated with their development, and how immunoengineering can be leveraged to overcome these challenges.</p>",[],True,"[""Ankur Singh""]","Singh, A.

review article,Nanomaterials for T-cell cancer immunotherapy,"<p>T-cell-based immunotherapies hold promise for the treatment of many types of cancer, with three approved products for B-cell malignancies and a large pipeline of treatments in clinical trials. However, there are several challenges to their broad implementation. These include insufficient expansion of adoptively transferred T cells, inefficient trafficking of T cells into solid tumours, decreased T-cell activity due to a hostile tumour microenvironment and the loss of target antigen expression. Together, these factors restrict the number of therapeutically active T cells engaging with tumours. Nanomaterials are uniquely suited to overcome these challenges, as they can be rationally designed to enhance T-cell expansion, navigate complex physical barriers and modulate tumour microenvironments. Here, we present an overview of nanomaterials that have been used to overcome clinical barriers to T-cell-based immunotherapies and provide our outlook of this emerging field at the interface of cancer immunotherapy and nanomaterial design.</p>",[],False,"[""Ningqiang Gong"", ""Neil C.

review article,Inducing immune tolerance with dendritic cell-targeting nanomedicines,"<p>Induced tolerogenic dendritic cells are a powerful immunotherapy for autoimmune disease that have shown promise in laboratory models of disease and early clinical trials. In contrast to conventional immunosuppressive treatments, tolerogenic immunotherapy leverages the cells and function of the immune system to quell the autoreactive lymphocytes responsible for damage and disease. The principle techniques of isolating and reprogramming dendritic cells (DCs), central to this approach, are well characterized. However, the broader application of this technology is limited by its high cost and bespoke nature. Nanomedicine offers an alternative route by performing this reprogramming process in situ. Here, we review the challenges and opportunities in using nanoparticles as a delivery mechanism to target DCs and induce immunomodulation, emphasizing their versatility. We then highlight their potential to solve critical problems in organ transplantation and increasingly prevalent autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis, where new immunotherapy approaches have begun to show promise.</p>",[],True,"[""Anna Cifuentes-Rius"", ""Anal Desai"", ""Daniel Yuen"", ""Angus P.

letter,Long-lived modulation of plasmonic absorption by ballistic thermal injection,"<p>Light&#8211;matter interactions that induce charge and energy transfer across interfaces form the foundation for photocatalysis, energy harvesting and photodetection, among other technologies. One of the most common mechanisms associated with these processes relies on carrier injection. However, the exact role of the energy transport associated with this hot-electron injection remains unclear. Plasmon-assisted photocatalytic efficiencies can improve when intermediate insulation layers are used to inhibit the charge transfer or when off-resonance excitations are employed, which suggests that additional energy transport and thermal effects could play an explicit role even if the charge transfer is inhibited. This provides an additional interfacial mechanism for the catalytic and plasmonic enhancement at interfaces that moves beyond the traditionally assumed physical charge injection. In this work, we report on a series of ultrafast plasmonic measurements that provide a direct measure of electronic distributions, both spatially and temporally, after the optical excitation of a metal/semiconductor heterostructure. We explicitly demonstrate that in cases of strong non-equilibrium, a novel energy transduction mechanism arises at the metal/semiconductor interface. We find that hot electrons in the metal contact transfer their energy to pre-existing free electrons in the semiconductor, without an equivalent spatiotemporal transfer of charge. Further, we demonstrate that this ballistic thermal injection mechanism can be utilized as a unique means to modulate plasmonic interactions. These experimental results are well-supported by both rigorous multilayer optical modelling and first-principle ab initio calculations.</p>",[],False,"[""John A. Tomko"", ""Evan L.

letter,Tuning layer-hybridized moiré excitons by the quantum-confined Stark effect,"<p>Moir&#233; superlattices offer an unprecedented opportunity for tailoring interactions between quantum particles and their coupling to electromagnetic fields. Strong superlattice potentials generate moir&#233; minibands of excitons&#8212;bound pairs of electrons and holes that reside either in a single layer (intralayer excitons) or in two separate layers (interlayer excitons). Twist-angle-controlled interlayer electronic hybridization can also mix these two types of exciton to combine their strengths. Here we report the direct observation of layer-hybridized moir&#233; excitons in angle-aligned WSe<sub>2</sub>/WS<sub>2</sub> and MoSe<sub>2</sub>/WS<sub>2</sub> superlattices by optical reflectance spectroscopy. These excitons manifest a hallmark signature of strong coupling in WSe<sub>2</sub>/WS<sub>2</sub>, that is, energy-level anticrossing and oscillator strength redistribution under a vertical electric field. They also exhibit doping-dependent renormalization and hybridization that are sensitive to the electronic correlation effects.

letter,Observation of single-defect memristor in an MoS2 atomic sheet,"<p>Non-volatile resistive switching, also known as memristor effect, where an electric field switches the resistance states of a two-terminal device, has emerged as an important concept in the development of high-density information storage, computing and reconfigurable systems. The past decade has witnessed substantial advances in non-volatile resistive switching materials such as metal oxides and solid electrolytes. It was long believed that leakage currents would prevent the observation of this phenomenon for nanometre-thin insulating layers. However, the recent discovery of non-volatile resistive switching in two-dimensional monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenide and hexagonal boron nitride sandwich structures (also known as atomristors) has refuted this belief and added a new materials dimension owing to the benefits of size scaling. Here we elucidate the origin of the switching mechanism in atomic sheets using monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> as a model system. Atomistic imaging and spectroscopy reveal that metal substitution into a sulfur vacancy results in a non-volatile change in the resistance, which is corroborated by computational studies of defect structures and electronic states. These findings provide an atomistic understanding of non-volatile switching and open a new direction in precision defect engineering, down to a single defect, towards achieving the smallest memristor for applications in ultra-dense memory, neuromorphic computing and radio-frequency communication systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Saban M.

Such topologies can be potentially involved in the energy transport in aggregated molecules or polymers but are yet to be uncovered. Here, using ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), we reveal the existence of intermolecular CoIns in molecular aggregates relevant for photovoltaics. Ultrafast, sub-10-fs 2DES tracks the coherent motion of a vibrational wave packet on an optically bright state and its abrupt transition into a dark state via a CoIn after only 40&#8201;fs. Non-adiabatic dynamics simulations identify an intermolecular CoIn as the source of these unusual dynamics.

article,All-solid-state spatial light modulator with independent phase and amplitude control for three-dimensional LiDAR applications,"<p>Spatial light modulators are essential optical elements in applications that require the ability to regulate the amplitude, phase and polarization of light, such as digital holography, optical communications and biomedical imaging. With the push towards miniaturization of optical components, static metasurfaces are used as competent alternatives. These evolved to active metasurfaces in which light-wavefront manipulation can be done in a time-dependent fashion. The active metasurfaces reported so far, however, still show incomplete phase modulation (below 360&#176;). Here we present an all-solid-state, electrically tunable and reflective metasurface array that can generate a specific phase or a continuous sweep between 0 and 360&#176; at an estimated rate of 5.4&#8201;MHz while independently adjusting the amplitude.

A key feature of our design is the presence of two independent control parameters (top and bottom gate voltages) in each nanoresonator, which are used to adjust the real and imaginary parts of the reflection coefficient independently. To demonstrate this array&#8217;s use in light detection and ranging, we performed a three-dimensional depth scan of an emulated street scene that consisted of a model car and a human figure up to a distance of 4.7&#8201;m.</p>",[],False,"[""Junghyun Park"", ""Byung Gil Jeong"", ""Sun Il Kim"", ""Duhyun Lee"", ""Jungwoo Kim"", ""Changgyun Shin"", ""Chang Bum Lee"", ""Tatsuhiro Otsuka"", ""Jisoo Kyoung"", ""Sangwook Kim"", ""Ki-Yeon Yang"", ""Yong-Young Park"", ""Jisan Lee"", ""Inoh Hwang"", ""Jaeduck Jang"", ""Seok Ho Song"", ""Mark L.

Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), which reside in hypoxic tumour regions, are characterized by high tumourigenicity and chemoresistance and are often responsible for tumour progression and recurrence. Here we report a nanotherapeutic strategy to kill CSCs in tumours using nanoparticles that are co-loaded with the differentiation-inducing agent, all-trans retinoic acid, and the chemotherapeutic drug, camptothecin. All-trans retinoic acid is released under hypoxic conditions, leading to CSC differentiation in the hypoxic niche. In differentiating CSC, the reactive oxygen species levels increase, which then causes the release of camptothecin and subsequent cell death. This dual strategy enables controlled drug release in CSCs and reduces stemness-related drug resistance, enhancing the chemotherapeutic response.
