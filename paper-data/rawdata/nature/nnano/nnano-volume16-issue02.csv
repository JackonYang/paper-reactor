review article,Nanoscale engineering of catalytic materials for sustainable technologies,"<p>Nanostructured materials of diverse architecture are ubiquitous in industrial catalysis. They offer exciting prospects to tackle various sustainability challenges faced by society. Since the introduction of the concept a century ago, researchers aspire to control the chemical identity, local environment and electronic properties of active sites on catalytic surfaces to optimize their reactivity in given applications. Nowadays, numerous strategies exist to tailor these characteristics with varying levels of atomic precision. Making headway relies upon the existence of analytical approaches able to resolve relevant structural features and remains challenging due to the inherent complexity even of the simplest heterogeneous catalysts, and to dynamic effects often occurring under reaction conditions. Computational methods play a complementary and ever-increasing role in pushing forward the design. Here, we examine how nanoscale engineering can enhance the selectivity and stability of catalysts. We highlight breakthroughs towards their commercialization and identify directions to guide future research and innovation.</p>",[],False,"[""Sharon Mitchell"", ""Ruixuan Qin"", ""Nanfeng Zheng"", ""Javier P\u00e9rez-Ram\u00edrez""]","Mitchell, S., Qin, R., Zheng, N. et al.

review article,Challenges in applying highly active Pt-based nanostructured catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions to fuel cell vehicles,"<p>The past 30&#8201;years have seen progress in the development of Pt-based nanocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction, and some are now in production on a commercial basis and used for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) for automotives and other applications. Further improvements in catalytic activity are required for wider uptake of PEFCs, however. In laboratories, researchers have developed various catalysts that have much higher activities than commercial ones, and these state-of-the-art catalysts have potential to improve energy conversion efficiencies and reduce the usage of platinum in PEFCs. There are several technical issues that must be solved before they can be applied in fuel cell vehicles, which require a high power density and practical durability, as well as high efficiency. In this Review, the development history of Pt-based nanocatalysts and recent analytical studies are summarized to identify the origin of these technical issues. Promising strategies for overcoming those issues are also discussed.</p>",[],False,"[""Kensaku Kodama"", ""Tomoyuki Nagai"", ""Akira Kuwaki"", ""Ryosuke Jinnouchi"", ""Yu Morimoto""]","Kodama, K., Nagai, T., Kuwaki, A. et al.

letter,Optical control of the valley Zeeman effect through many-exciton interactions,"<p>Charge carriers in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as WSe<sub>2</sub>, have their spin and valley-pseudospin locked into an optically addressable index that is proposed as a basis for future information processing. The manipulation of this spin&#8211;valley index, which carries a magnetic moment, requires tuning its energy. This is typically achieved through an external magnetic field (B), which is practically cumbersome. However, the valley-contrasting optical Stark effect achieves valley control without B, but requires large incident powers. Thus, other efficient routes to control the spin&#8211;valley index are desirable. Here we show that many-body interactions among interlayer excitons (IXs) in a WSe<sub>2</sub>/MoSe<sub>2</sub> heterobilayer (HBL) induce a steady-state valley Zeeman splitting that corresponds to B&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;6&#8201;T. This anomalous splitting, present at incident powers as low as microwatts, increases with power and is able to enhance, suppress or even flip the sign of a B-induced splitting. Moreover, the g-factor of valley Zeeman splitting can be tuned by ~30% with incident power. In addition to valleytronics, our results could prove helpful to achieve optical non-reciprocity using two-dimensional materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Weijie Li"", ""Xin Lu"", ""Jiatian Wu"", ""Ajit Srivastava""]","Li, W., Lu, X., Wu, J. et al.

letter,Scalable and hierarchically designed polymer film as a selective thermal emitter for high-performance all-day radiative cooling,"<p>Traditional cooling systems consume tremendous amounts of energy and thus aggravate the greenhouse effect. Passive radiative cooling, dissipating an object&#8217;s heat through an atmospheric transparency window (8&#8211;13&#8201;&#956;m) to outer space without any energy consumption, has attracted much attention. The unique feature of radiative cooling lies in the high emissivity in the atmospheric transparency window through which heat can be dissipated to the universe. Therefore, for achieving high cooling performance, the design and fabrication of selective emitters, with emission strongly dominant in the transparency window, is of essential importance, as such spectral selection suppresses parasitic absorption from the surrounding thermal radiation. Recently, various materials and structures with tailored spectrum responses have been investigated to achieve the effect of daytime radiative cooling. However, most of the radiative cooling materials reported possess broad-band absorption/emission covering the whole mid-infrared wavelength. Here we demonstrate that a hierarchically designed polymer nanofibre-based film, produced by a scalable electrostatic spinning process, enables selective mid-infrared emission, effective sunlight reflection and therefore excellent all-day radiative cooling performance. Specifically, the C&#8211;O&#8211;C (1,260&#8211;1,110&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and C&#8211;OH (1,239&#8211;1,030&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) bonding endows the selective emissivity of 78% in 8&#8211;13&#8201;&#956;m wavelength range, and the design of nanofibres with a controlled diameter allows for a high reflectivity of 96.3% in 0.3&#8211;2.5&#8201;&#956;m wavelength range. As a result, we observe ~3&#8201;&#176;C cooling improvement of this selective thermal emitter as compared to that of a non-selective emitter at night, and 5&#8201;&#176;C sub-ambient cooling under sunlight. The impact of this hierarchically designed selective thermal emitter on alleviating global warming and temperature regulating an Earth-like planet is also analysed, with a significant advantage demonstrated. With its excellent cooling performance and a scalable process, this hierarchically designed selective thermal emitter opens a new pathway towards large-scale applications of all-day radiative cooling materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Duo Li"", ""Xin Liu"", ""Wei Li"", ""Zhenhui Lin"", ""Bin Zhu"", ""Zizhong Li"", ""Jinlei Li"", ""Bo Li"", ""Shanhui Fan"", ""Jiwei Xie"", ""Jia Zhu""]","Li, D., Liu, X., Li, W. et al.

However, the practical realization of such heterostructures is challenging because of the difficulty in achieving controllable direct synthesis or van der Waals integration of halide perovskites due to their mobile and fragile crystal lattices. Here we report direct growth of large-area nanosheets of diverse phase-pure Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites with thicknesses down to one monolayer at the solution&#8211;air interface and a reliable approach for gently transferring and stacking these nanosheets. These advances enable the deterministic fabrication of arbitrary vertical heterostructures and multi-heterostructures of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites with greater structural degrees of freedom that define the electronic structures of the heterojunctions.

article,A high-energy and long-cycling lithium–sulfur pouch cell via a macroporous catalytic cathode with double-end binding sites,"<p>Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are attractive alternatives to lithium-ion batteries because of their high theoretical specific energy and natural abundance of sulfur. However, the practical specific energy and cycle life of Li&#8211;S pouch cells are significantly limited by the use of thin sulfur electrodes, flooded electrolytes and Li metal degradation. Here we propose a cathode design concept to achieve good Li&#8211;S pouch cell performances. The cathode is composed of uniformly embedded ZnS nanoparticles and Co&#8211;N&#8211;C single-atom catalyst to form double-end binding sites inside a highly oriented macroporous host, which can effectively immobilize and catalytically convert polysulfide intermediates during cycling, thus eliminating the shuttle effect and lithium metal corrosion. The ordered macropores enhance ionic transport under high sulfur loading by forming sufficient triple-phase boundaries between catalyst, conductive support and electrolyte. This design prevents the formation of inactive sulfur (dead sulfur). Our cathode structure shows improved performances in a pouch cell configuration under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation. A 1-A-h-level pouch cell with only 100% lithium excess can deliver a cell specific energy of &gt;300&#8201;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with a Coulombic efficiency &gt;95% for 80 cycles.</p>",[],False,"[""Chen Zhao"", ""Gui-Liang Xu"", ""Zhou Yu"", ""Leicheng Zhang"", ""Inhui Hwang"", ""Yu-Xue Mo"", ""Yuxun Ren"", ""Lei Cheng"", ""Cheng-Jun Sun"", ""Yang Ren"", ""Xiaobing Zuo"", ""Jun-Tao Li"", ""Shi-Gang Sun"", ""Khalil Amine"", ""Tianshou Zhao""]","Zhao, C., Xu, GL., Yu, Z. et al.A high-energy and long-cycling lithium–sulfur pouch cell via a macroporous catalytic cathode with double-end binding sites.

Here, we explore implementation of such biological functions in artificial membranes and demonstrate two-dimensional self-assembled heterostructures of graphene oxide and polyamine macromolecules, forming a network of ionic channels that exhibit regulated permeability of water and monovalent ions. This permeability can be tuned by a change of pH or the presence of certain ions.
