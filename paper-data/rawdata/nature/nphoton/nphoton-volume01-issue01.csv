letter,Trapping and delaying photons for one nanosecond in an ultrasmall high-Q photonic-crystal nanocavity,"<p>Light is intrinsically very difficult to store in a small space. The ability to trap photons for a long time (photon lifetime, &#964;<sub>ph</sub>) and to slow the propagation of light plays a significant role in quantum information and optical processing. Photonic-crystal cavities with an ultrahigh quality factor (Q) are attracting attention because of their extremely small volume; however, high-Q demonstrations have been accomplished only with spectral measurements. Here we describe time-domain measurements on photonic-crystal cavities with the highest Q among wavelength-scale cavities, and show directly that photons are trapped for one nanosecond. These techniques constitute clear and accurate ways of investigating ultrasmall and long &#964;<sub>ph</sub> systems. We also show that optical pulses are delayed for &#8764;1.45 ns, corresponding to light propagation at &#8764;2&#215;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>&#160;c the speed of light in a vacuum, which is the slowest for any dielectric slow-light medium. Furthermore, we succeeded in dynamically changing the Q within the &#964;<sub>ph</sub>, which is key to realizing the dynamic control of light and photon-trapping memory.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1, Morinosato-Wakamiya Atsugi, Kanagawa, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takasumi Tanabe"", "",\u00a0Masaya Notomi"", "",\u00a0Eiichi Kuramochi"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hideaki Taniyama""]}]",False,"[""Takasumi Tanabe"", ""Masaya Notomi"", ""Eiichi Kuramochi"", ""Akihiko Shinya"", ""Hideaki Taniyama""]","Tanabe, T., Notomi, M., Kuramochi, E. et al.

letter,Vector field microscopic imaging of light,"<p>The behaviour of nanoscale optical devices in a variety of burgeoning research areas, such as photonic crystals, near-field microscopy, surface plasmonics and negative index of refraction materials, is governed by strongly localized electromagnetic waves. Although such light waves are analogous to the localized electronic wavefunctions that determine the properties of solid-state quantum devices, unlike matter waves, these optical fields are vectorial in nature, and their orientation and magnitude vary on a subwavelength scale. In order to obtain a complete description of light in nanoscale devices, it is therefore crucial to be able to map the field vectors with subwavelength resolution. Thus far, local field vectors have mostly been studied by theoretical means. Here, we describe and demonstrate the first experimental mapping of vector fields of light on the nanoscale. By directly accessing the local field in its entirety, new capabilities and applications in nanophotonics may emerge.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-747, Korea"", ""authors"": [""K.

letter,Polarization-transparent microphotonic devices in the strong confinement limit,"<p>Microphotonic structures that strongly confine light, such as photonic crystals and micron-sized resonators, have unique characteristics that could radically advance technology. However, such devices cannot be used in most applications because of their inherent polarization sensitivity; they respond differently to light polarized along different axes. To take advantage of the distinctive properties of these structures, a general, integrated, broadband solution to their polarization sensitivity is needed. Here, we show the first demonstration of such a solution. It enables arbitrary, polarization-sensitive, strong-confinement (SC) microphotonic devices to be rendered insensitive (transparent) to the input polarization at all wavelengths of operation. To test our approach, we create the first polarization-transparent add&#8211;drop filter from polarization-sensitive microring resonators. It shows almost complete elimination of polarization sensitivity over the 60-nm bandwidth measured, while maintaining outstanding filter performance. This development is a milestone for SC microphotonics, allowing the applications of photonic-crystal and microring devices to several areas, including communications, spectroscopy and remote sensing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tymon Barwicz"", "",\u00a0Michael R.

article,Ultracompact optical buffers on a silicon chip,"<p>On-chip optical buffers based on waveguide delay lines might have significant implications for the development of optical interconnects in computer systems. Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) submicrometre photonic wire waveguides are used, because they can provide strong light confinement at the diffraction limit, allowing dramatic scaling of device size. Here we report on-chip optical delay lines based on such waveguides that consist of up to 100 microring resonators cascaded in either coupled-resonator or all-pass filter (APF) configurations. On-chip group delays exceeding 500&#160;ps are demonstrated in a device with a footprint below 0.09&#160;mm<sup>2</sup>. The trade-offs between resonantly enhanced group delay, device size, insertion loss and operational bandwidth are analysed for various delay-line designs. A large fractional group delay exceeding 10 bits is achieved for bit rates as high as 20&#160;Gbps. Measurements of system-level metrics as bit error rates for different bit rates demonstrate error-free operation up to 5&#160;Gbps.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IBM Thomas J.
