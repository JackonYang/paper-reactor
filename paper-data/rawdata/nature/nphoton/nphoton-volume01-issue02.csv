review article,Integrated optofluidics: A new river of light,"<p>The realization of miniaturized optofluidic platforms offers potential for achieving more functional and more compact devices. Such integrated systems bring fluid and light together and exploit their microscale interaction for a large variety of applications. The high sensitivity of compact microphotonic devices can generate effective microfluidic sensors, with integration capabilities. By turning the technology around, the exploitation of fluid properties holds the promise of highly flexible, tunable or reconfigurable microphotonic devices.

letter,Field enhancement within an optical fibre with a subwavelength air core,"<p>Tightly confined light enables a variety of applications ranging from nonlinear light management to atomic manipulation. Photonic-crystal fibres (PCFs) can provide strong guidance in very small cores while simultaneously offering long interaction lengths. However, light confinement in waveguides is usually ultimately limited by diffraction, which tends to spread light away from the waveguiding core, despite its higher refractive index. It was recently demonstrated that such spreading fields can be trapped by a nanometre-scale slot inside a strongly guiding silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide. In this letter we demonstrate the concentration of optical energy within a subwavelength-scale air hole running down the length of a PCF core. The core resembles a submicrometre-diameter tube with a bore diameter of 200&#160;nm or less. The high intensity in an air hole, coupled with long interaction lengths, promises a new class of experiments in light&#8211;matter interaction and nonlinear fibre optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Centre for Photonics and Photonic Materials, University of Bath, Bath, BA2 7AY, UK"", ""authors"": [""G.

letter,A surface-emitting laser incorporating a high-index-contrast subwavelength grating,"<p>Semiconductor diode lasers can be used in a variety of applications including telecommunications, displays, solid-state lighting, sensing and printing. Among them, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are particularly promising. Because they emit light normal to the constituent wafer surface, it is possible to extract light more efficiently and to fabricate two-dimensional device arrays. A VCSEL contains two distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors for optical feedback, separated by a very short active gain region. Typically, the reflectivity of the DBRs must exceed 99.5% in order for the VCSEL to lase. However, the realization of practical VCSELs that can be used over a broad spectrum of wavelengths has been hindered by the poor optical and thermal properties of candidate DBR materials. In this Letter, we present surface-emitting lasers that incorporate a single-layer high-index-contrast subwavelength grating (HCG). The HCG provides both efficient optical feedback and control of the wavelength and polarization of the emitted light. Such integration reduces the required VCSEL mirror epitaxial thickness by a factor of two and increases fabrication tolerance. This work will directly influence the future designs of VCSELs, photovoltaic cells and light-emitting diodes at blue&#8211;green, 1.3&#8211;1.55&#160;&#181;m and mid- to far-infrared wavelengths.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, California, 94720, USA"", ""authors"": [""Michael C.Y.

article,Morpho butterfly wing scales demonstrate highly selective vapour response,"<p>Tropical Morpho butterflies are famous for their brilliant iridescent colours, which arise from ordered arrays of scales on their wings. Here we show that the iridescent scales of the Morpho sulkowskyi butterfly give a different optical response to different individual vapours, and that this optical response dramatically outperforms that of existing nano-engineered photonic sensors. The reflectance spectra of the scales provide information about the nature and concentration of the vapours, allowing us to identify a range of closely related vapours&#8211;water, methanol, ethanol and isomers of dichloroethylene when they are analysed individually. By comparing the reflectance as a function of time for different vapours, we deduce that wing regions with scale structures of differing spatial periodicity give contributions to the overall spectral response at different wavelengths. Our optical model explains the effect of different components of the wing scales on the vapour response, and could steer the design of new man-made optical gas sensors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Materials Analysis and Chemical Sciences, General Electric Global Research Center, New York, 12309, Niskayuna, USA"", ""authors"": [""Radislav A.
