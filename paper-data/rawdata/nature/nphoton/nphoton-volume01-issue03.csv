review article,Quantum communication,"<p>Quantum communication, and indeed quantum information in general, has changed the way we think about quantum physics. In 1984 and 1991, the first protocol for quantum cryptography and the first application of quantum non-locality, respectively, attracted interest from a diverse field of researchers in theoretical and experimental physics, mathematics and computer science. Since then we have seen a fundamental shift in how we understand information when it is encoded in quantum systems. We review the current state of research and future directions in this field of science with special emphasis on quantum key distribution and quantum networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Group of Applied Physics, University of Geneva, Geneva 4, 1211, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Nicolas Gisin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Rob Thew""]}]",False,"[""Nicolas Gisin"", ""Rob Thew""]","Gisin, N., Thew, R.

letter,Optical switching by capillary condensation,"<p>Photonic materials, which have optical properties that can be modulated by light, are extremely interesting both for their fundamental properties as well as for their potential in the applications of all-optical signal processing and possibly optical computing. Earlier studies have been based on nonlinear photonic crystals, and have required relatively high local light intensities to be used. We propose a completely different strategy based on the interplay between light propagation and capillary condensation of gases in porous photonic structures. We show experimentally that the local light intensity can alter the gas/liquid phase equilibrium inside the pores, which allows the refractive-index distribution inside the material to be optically tuned. As a specific example, we show how this feature can be used to obtain optical bistability in porous superlattices. Our results provide a new approach for achieving optical control in photonic systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""European Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy and INFM-BEC, via Nello Carrara 1, Sesto Fiorentino, 50019, (Florence), Italy"", ""authors"": [""Pierre Barthelemy"", "",\u00a0Costanza Toninelli"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Diederik S.

letter,Optical thin-film materials with low refractive index for broadband elimination of Fresnel reflection,"<p>In 1880, by studying light passing through Earth's atmosphere, Lord Rayleigh mathematically demonstrated that graded-refractive-index layers have broadband antireflection characteristics. Graded-index coatings with different index profiles have been investigated for broadband antireflection properties, particularly with air as the ambient medium. However, because of the unavailability of optical materials with very low refractive indices that closely match the refractive index of air, such broadband antireflection coatings have not been realizable. Here we report the fabrication of TiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> graded-index films deposited by oblique-angle deposition, and, for the first time, we demonstrate their potential for antireflection coatings by virtually eliminating Fresnel reflection from an AlN&#8211;air interface over a broad range of wavelengths. This is achieved by controlling the refractive index of the TiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> nanorod layers, down to a minimum value of n&#160;=&#160;1.05 in the case of the latter, the lowest value so far reported.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Future Chips Constellation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 110 8th Street, Troy, 12180, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""J.-Q.

article,Hybrid polymer/sol–gel waveguide modulators with exceptionally large electro–optic coefficients,"<p>Electro&#8211;optic (EO) modulators are typically made from inorganic materials such as LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, but replacing them with organic EO materials, that is, ones with optical properties that change in response to an electric field, could be a promising alternative because they offer large bandwidth, ease of processing and relatively low cost. Here we incorporate a doped, crosslinked organic EO polymer into hybrid polymer/sol&#8211;gel waveguide modulator devices with exceptional performance. The half-wave voltages of the resulting Mach&#8211;Zehnder (MZ) and phase modulators at 1550&#160;nm are 1&#160;V and 2.5&#160;V, respectively. The unique properties of the sol&#8211;gel cladding materials used in the hybrid structure result in a 100% device poling efficiency, leading to respective in-device EO coefficients of 138&#160;pm&#160;V<sup>&#8211;1</sup> and 170&#160;pm&#160;V<sup>&#8211;1</sup> in the MZ and phase modulators. These results are the first to show in-device EO coefficients that are five to six times larger than those of the benchmark inorganic material.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""College of Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, 85721, Arizona, USA"", ""authors"": [""Y.
