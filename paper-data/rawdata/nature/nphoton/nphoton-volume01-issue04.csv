review article,Semiconductor quantum light sources,"<p>Lasers and LEDs have a statistical distribution in the number of photons emitted within a given time interval. Applications exploiting the quantum properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating indistinguishable single photons and entangled-photon pairs using such structures. This suggests that it may be possible to realize compact, robust, LED-like semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Toshiba Research Europe Limited, 260 Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, CB4 0WE, UK"", ""authors"": [""Andrew J.

letter,Optical cloaking with metamaterials,"<p>Artificially structured metamaterials have enabled unprecedented flexibility in manipulating electromagnetic waves and producing new functionalities, including the cloak of invisibility based on coordinate transformation. Unlike other cloaking approaches, which are typically limited to subwavelength objects, the transformation method allows the design of cloaking devices that render a macroscopic object invisible. In addition, the design is not sensitive to the object that is being cloaked. The first experimental demonstration of such a cloak at microwave frequencies was recently reported. We note, however, that that design cannot be implemented for an optical cloak, which is certainly of particular interest because optical frequencies are where the word &#8216;invisibility&#8217; is conventionally defined. Here we present the design of a non-magnetic cloak operating at optical frequencies. The principle and structure of the proposed cylindrical cloak are analysed, and the general recipe for the implementation of such a device is provided.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, USA"", ""authors"": [""Wenshan Cai"", "",\u00a0Uday K.

letter,Local polarization of tightly focused unpolarized light,"<p>The polarization of light is important in a great variety of optical phenomena, ranging from transmission, reflection and scattering to polarimetric imaging of scenes and quantum-mechanical selection rules of atomic and molecular transitions. Among some less-well-known phenomena that illustrate the vectorial nature of light are the Pancharatnam (or geometric) phase, singularities in the polarization pattern of clear sky and polarization of microwave background radiation. Here, we examine the partial polarization of focused light. We experimentally demonstrate a rather surprising phenomenon, where the focusing of unpolarized light results in rings of full polarization in the focal plane of the focusing optics. The polarization rings are imaged with a resolution of &lt;100&#160;nm by probing the focal region using a gold nanoparticle.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Engineering Physics and Mathematics and Center for New Materials, Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), PO Box 3500, FI-02015 TKK, Finland"", ""authors"": [""Klas Lindfors"", "",\u00a0Arri Priimagi"", "",\u00a0Tero Set\u00e4l\u00e4"", "",\u00a0Andriy Shevchenko"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Matti Kaivola""]}, {""address"": ""Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), School of Information and Communication Technology, Electrum 229, Kista, SE-164 40, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Ari T.

article,Low-threshold continuous-wave Raman silicon laser,"<p>We report the first demonstration of a low-threshold continuous-wave (c.w.) Raman silicon laser based on a ring-resonator-cavity configuration. We achieved a lasing threshold of 20&#160;mW, slope efficiency of 28% and an output power of 50&#160;mW, with a 25&#160;V reverse bias applied to the p-i-n silicon waveguides. This represents nearly a tenfold improvement in the lasing threshold and more than a fivefold improvement in both slope efficiency and output power over previous results. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time c.w. lasing with zero bias voltage. In this arrangement, the laser does not require an external electrical power supply, and we obtained a lasing threshold of 26&#160;mW and laser output power exceeding 10&#160;mW. The realization of low-threshold lasing and lasing with no external bias is a major advance towards producing practical silicon lasers based on stimulated Raman scattering, for applications ranging from telecommunications and interconnects to optical sensing and biomedical applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Intel Corporation, 2200 Mission College Blvd, SC12-326, Santa Clara, 95054, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Haisheng Rong"", "",\u00a0Shengbo Xu"", "",\u00a0Ying-Hao Kuo"", "",\u00a0Vanessa Sih"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mario Paniccia""]}, {""address"": ""Intel Corporation, S.B.I.
