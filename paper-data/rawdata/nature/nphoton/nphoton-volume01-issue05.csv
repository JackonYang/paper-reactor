letter,Coherent optical link over hundreds of metres and hundreds of terahertz with subfemtosecond timing jitter,"<p>Recent developments in stabilized lasers have resulted in ultrastable optical oscillators with spectral purities below 1&#160;Hz refs. These oscillators are not transportable at present and operate at a single frequency. To realize their full potential, a highly coherent, frequency-diverse fibre-optic network is needed to faithfully transfer the optical signals to remote sites and to different optical frequencies. Here we demonstrate such a coherent network composed of erbium fibre and Ti:sapphire laser-based, optical-frequency combs, stabilized optical-fibre links and cavity-stabilized lasers. We coherently transmit an optical carrier over 750&#160;m of optical fibre with conversions to wavelengths of 657, 767, 1,126 and 1,535&#160;nm, an overall timing jitter of 590 attoseconds, and a frequency instability of 12&#160;mHz for the 195&#160;THz carrier in 1&#160;s and 250&#160;&#181;Hz in 1,000&#160;s. This first remote synchronization of two frequency combs also demonstrates a factor of 30 improvement in the relative stability of fibre frequency combs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Standards and Technology, 325 Broadway M.S. 815 Boulder, Colorado, 80305, USA"", ""authors"": [""I.

letter,Terahertz quantum-cascade-laser source based on intracavity difference-frequency generation,"<p>The terahertz spectral range (&#955;&#160;=&#160;30&#8211;300&#160;&#181;m) has long been devoid of compact, electrically pumped, room-temperature semiconductor sources. Despite recent progress with terahertz quantum cascade lasers, existing devices still require cryogenic cooling. An alternative way to produce terahertz radiation is frequency down-conversion in a nonlinear optical crystal using infrared or visible pump lasers. This approach offers broad spectral tunability and does work at room temperature; however, it requires powerful laser pumps and a more complicated optical set-up, resulting in bulky and unwieldy sources. Here we demonstrate a monolithically integrated device designed to combine the advantages of electrically pumped semiconductor lasers and nonlinear optical sources. Our device is a dual-wavelength quantum cascade laser with the active region engineered to possess giant second-order nonlinear susceptibility associated with intersubband transitions in coupled quantum wells. The laser operates at &#955;<sub>1</sub>&#160;=&#160;7.6&#160;&#181;m and &#955;<sub>2</sub>&#160;=&#160;8.7&#160;&#181;m, and produces terahertz output at &#955;&#160;=&#160;60&#160;&#181;m through intracavity difference-frequency generation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Mikhail A.

letter,Changing the colour of light in a silicon resonator,"<p>As the demand for high bandwidths in microelectronic systems increases, optical interconnect architectures are now being considered that involve schemes commonly used in telecommunications, such as wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and wavelength conversion. In such on-chip architectures, the ability to perform wavelength conversion is required. So far wavelength conversion on a silicon chip has only been demonstrated using schemes that are fundamentally all-optical, making their integration on a microelectronic chip challenging. In contrast, we show wavelength conversion obtained by inducing ultrafast electro&#8211;optic tuning of a microcavity. It is well known that tuning the parameters of an optical cavity induces filtering of different colours of light. Here we demonstrate that it can also change the colour of light. This is an effect often observed in other disciplines, for example, in acoustics, where the sound generated by a resonating guitar string can be modified by changing the length of the strings (that is, the resonators). Here we show this same tuning effect in optics, enabling compact on-chip electrical wavelength conversion. We demonstrate a change in wavelength of up to 2.5&#160;nm with up to 34% on&#8211;off conversion efficiency.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 14853, USA"", ""authors"": [""Stefan F.
