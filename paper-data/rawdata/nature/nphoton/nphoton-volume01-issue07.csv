letter,All-optical modulation by plasmonic excitation of CdSe quantum dots,"<p>Photonics is a promising candidate technology for information processing, communication and data storage. Essential building blocks, such as logic elements and modulators, have been demonstrated. However, because of weak nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, these components typically require high power densities and large interaction volumes, limiting their application in dense chip-based integration. A solution may be found in surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), guided electromagnetic waves that propagate with high field confinement along a metal&#8211;dielectric interface. We demonstrate an all-optical modulator in which efficient interaction between two light beams at different wavelengths is achieved by converting them into co-propagating SPPs interacting by means of a thin layer of CdSe quantum dots (QDs). The high SPP field confinement and high QD-absorption cross-section enable optical modulation at low power densities (&#8764;10<sup>2</sup>&#160;W&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) in micrometre-scale planar devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""California Institute of Technology, 1200 E.

letter,Electro–optically tunable microring resonators in lithium niobate,"<p>Optical microresonators have recently attracted growing attention in the photonics community. Their applications range from quantum electrodynamics to sensors and filtering devices for optical telecommunication systems, where they will probably become an essential building block. Integration of nonlinear and electro&#8211;optical properties in resonators represents a very stimulating challenge, as it would incorporate new and more advanced functionality. Lithium niobate is an excellent candidate material, being an established choice for electro&#8211;optic and nonlinear optical applications. Here we report on the first realization of optical microring resonators in submicrometre thin films of lithium niobate. High-index-contrast films are produced by an improved crystal-ion-slicing and bonding technique using benzocyclobutene. The rings have radius R&#160;=&#160;100&#160;&#181;m, and their transmission spectrum has been tuned using the electro&#8211;optic effect. These results open new possibilities for the use of lithium niobate in chip-scale integrated optical devices and nonlinear optical microcavities.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nonlinear Optics Laboratory, Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, 8093, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Andrea Guarino"", "",\u00a0Gorazd Poberaj"", "",\u00a0Daniele Rezzonico"", "",\u00a0Riccardo Degl'Innocenti"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Peter G\u00fcnter""]}]",False,"[""Andrea Guarino"", ""Gorazd Poberaj"", ""Daniele Rezzonico"", ""Riccardo Degl'Innocenti"", ""Peter G\u00fcnter""]","Guarino, A., Poberaj, G., Rezzonico, D. et al.

article,Terahertz transfer onto a telecom optical carrier,"<p>In a GaAs crystal, owing to the anomalous dispersion introduced by optical phonon absorption, a phase-matched interaction is possible between a near-infrared beam and a terahertz (THz) wave. We exploit this nonlinear optical process to allow the merging of THz-quantum-cascade-laser and telecom technologies by injecting a telecom beam into a suitably designed THz quantum-cascade laser. Within the optical cavity, the phase and amplitude of the THz wave are recorded onto the near-infrared beam, which can be transported through an optical fibre. We show that the process is phase-matched and can be tuned over the entire telecom range by waveguide engineering. This nonlinear up-conversion technique opens up new possibilities in the optical treatment of THz, by taking advantage of the highly developed telecom technology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Mat\u00e9riaux et Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes Quantiques, Universit\u00e9 Paris 7, 10 rue A.

article,Actuation of micro-optomechanical systems via cavity-enhanced optical dipole forces,"<p>Optical forces can produce significant mechanical effects in micro- and nanophotonic systems. Here we demonstrate a novel optomechanical system using a movable, micrometre-scale waveguide evanescently coupled to a high-Q optical microresonator. Micrometre-scale displacements of the waveguide are observed for milliwatt-level optical input powers. Measurement of the spatial variation of the force on the waveguide indicates that it arises from a cavity-enhanced optical dipole force resulting from the stored optical field of the resonator. This force is used to realize an all-optical tunable filter operating with submilliwatt control power. A theoretical model of the system shows that the maximum achievable force is independent of the intrinsic Q of the optical resonator and scales inversely with the cavity mode volume, suggesting that such forces may become even more effective as devices approach the nanoscale.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Thomas J.
