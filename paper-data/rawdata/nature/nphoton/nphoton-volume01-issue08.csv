review article,Spontaneous-emission control by photonic crystals and nanocavities,"<p>We describe the recent experimental progress in the control of spontaneous emission by manipulating optical modes with photonic crystals. It has been clearly demonstrated that the spontaneous emission from light emitters embedded in photonic crystals can be suppressed by the so-called photonic bandgap, whereas the emission efficiency in the direction where optical modes exist can be enhanced. Also, when an artificial defect is introduced into the photonic crystal, a photonic nanocavity is produced that can interact with light emitters. Cavity quality factors, or Q factors, of up to 2 million have been realized while maintaining very small mode volumes, and both spontaneous-emission modification (the Purcell effect) and strong-coupling phenomena have been demonstrated. The use of photonic crystals and nanocavities to manipulate spontaneous emission will contribute to the evolution of a variety of applications, including illumination, display, optical communication, solar energy and even quantum-information systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto University, Katsura, Nishikyo-Ku, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Susumu Noda"", "",\u00a0Masayuki Fujita"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Takashi Asano""]}]",False,"[""Susumu Noda"", ""Masayuki Fujita"", ""Takashi Asano""]","Noda, S., Fujita, M. & Asano, T.

letter,Mirrorless optical parametric oscillator,"<p>Parametric interaction of counterpropagating photons has the unique property of automatically establishing distributed feedback and thus realizing novel sources of coherent and tunable radiation, such as mirrorless optical parametric oscillators. This device does not require alignment or any optical components other than the second-order nonlinear medium itself. Here we present the first experimental demonstration of such an oscillator, which was made feasible by quasi phase-matching in a nonlinear photonic structure with submicrometre periodicity. This type of oscillator has been extensively discussed as a theoretical possibility. It generates signal and idler waves in the near- and mid-infrared, respectively, and exhibits unique and useful spectral properties. The oscillator signal is essentially a wavelength-shifted replica of the pump spectrum, and the bandwidth of the idler is two orders of magnitude narrower than that of the pump. It also has very low output wavelength sensitivity to temperature variations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Applied Physics Department, Laser Physics, Royal Institute of Technology, AlbaNova University Center, Roslagstullsbacken 21, Stockholm, 10691, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Carlota Canalias"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Valdas Pasiskevicius""]}]",False,"[""Carlota Canalias"", ""Valdas Pasiskevicius""]","Canalias, C., Pasiskevicius, V.

letter,Optical arbitrary waveform processing of more than 100 spectral comb lines,"<p>Pulse-shaping techniques, in which user-specified, ultrashort-pulse fields are synthesized by means of parallel manipulation of optical Fourier components, have now been widely adopted. Mode-locked lasers producing combs of frequency-stabilized spectral lines have resulted in revolutionary advances in frequency metrology. However, until recently, pulse shapers addressed spectral lines in groups, at low spectral resolution. Line-by-line pulse shaping, in which spectral lines are resolved and manipulated individually, leads to a fundamentally new regime for optical arbitrary waveform generation, in which the advantages of pulse shaping and of frequency combs are exploited simultaneously. Here we demonstrate programmable line-by-line shaping of more than 100 spectral lines, which constitutes a significant step in scaling towards high waveform complexity. Optical arbitrary waveform generation promises to have an impact both in optical science (allowing, for example, coherent control generalizations of comb-based time&#8211;frequency spectroscopies) and in technology (enabling new truly coherent multiwavelength processing concepts for spread-spectrum lightwave communications and light detection and ranging, lidar).</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, 465 Northwestern Avenue, West Lafayette, 47907-2035, Indiana, USA"", ""authors"": [""Zhi Jiang"", "",\u00a0Chen-Bin Huang"", "",\u00a0Daniel E.

letter,Photonic-crystal full-colour displays,"<p>In our information-rich world, it is becoming increasingly important to develop technologies capable of displaying dynamic and changeable data, for reasons ranging from value-added advertising to environmental sustainability. There is an intense drive at the moment towards paper-like displays, devices having a high reflectivity and contrast to provide viewability in a variety of environments, particularly in sunlight where emissive or backlit devices perform very poorly. The list of possible technologies is extensive, including electrophoretic, cholesteric liquid crystalline, electrochromic, electrodewetting, interferometric and more. Despite tremendous advances, the key drawback of all these existing display options relates to colour. As soon as an RGB (red, green and blue) colour filter or spatially modulated colour scheme is implemented, substantial light losses are inevitable even if the intrinsic reflectivity of the material is very good.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, 80 St George Street, Toronto, M5S 3H6, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Andr\u00e9 C.

article,Wavelength-scale stationary-wave integrated Fourier-transform spectrometry,"<p>Spectrometry is a general physical-analysis approach for investigating light&#8211;matter interactions. However, the complex designs of existing spectrometers render them resistant to simplification and miniaturization, both of which are vital for applications in micro- and nanotechnology and which are now undergoing intensive research. Stationary-wave integrated Fourier-transform spectrometry (SWIFTS)&#8212;an approach based on direct intensity detection of a standing wave resulting from either reflection (as in the principle of colour photography by Gabriel Lippmann) or counterpropagative interference phenomenon&#8212;is expected to be able to overcome this drawback. Here, we present a SWIFTS-based spectrometer relying on an original optical near-field detection method in which optical nanoprobes are used to sample directly the evanescent standing wave in the waveguide. Combined with integrated optics, we report a way of reducing the volume of the spectrometer to a few hundreds of cubic wavelengths. This is the first attempt, using SWIFTS, to produce a very small integrated one-dimensional spectrometer suitable for applications where microspectrometers are essential.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Grenoble, Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier, CNRS, BP 53, Grenoble, F38041, Cedex, France"", ""authors"": [""Etienne le Coarer"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Pierre Kern""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratoire de Nanotechnologie et d'Instrumentation Optique, ICD, CNRS (FRE2848), Universit\u00e9 Technologique de Troyes, BP 2060, Troyes, 10010, France"", ""authors"": [""Sylvain Blaize"", "",\u00a0Ilan Stefanon"", "",\u00a0Gilles L\u00e9rondel"", "",\u00a0Gr\u00e9gory Leblond"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Pascal Royer""]}, {""address"": ""Institut de Micro\u00e9lectronique d'Electromagn\u00e9tisme et de Photonique, INPG-UJF-CNRS, (UMR5130), BP 257, Grenoble, 38016, Cedex, France"", ""authors"": [""Pierre Benech"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Alain Morand""]}, {""address"": ""CEA-LETI, Minatec 17 rue des Martyrs, Grenoble, F38054, Cedex, France"", ""authors"": [""Jean Marc Fedeli""]}]",False,"[""Etienne le Coarer"", ""Sylvain Blaize"", ""Pierre Benech"", ""Ilan Stefanon"", ""Alain Morand"", ""Gilles L\u00e9rondel"", ""Gr\u00e9gory Leblond"", ""Pierre Kern"", ""Jean Marc Fedeli"", ""Pascal Royer""]","le Coarer, E., Blaize, S., Benech, P. et al.
