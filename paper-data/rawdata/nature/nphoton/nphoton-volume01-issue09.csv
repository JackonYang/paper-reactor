letter,All-optical anatomical co-registration for molecular imaging of small animals using dynamic contrast,"<p>Optical molecular imaging in small animals harnesses the power of highly specific and biocompatible contrast agents for drug development and disease research. However, the widespread adoption of in vivo optical imaging has been inhibited by its inability to clearly resolve and identify targeted internal organs. Optical tomography and combined X-ray and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) approaches developed to address this problem are generally expensive, complex or incapable of true anatomical co-registration. Here, we present a remarkably simple all-optical method that can generate co-registered anatomical maps of a mouse's internal organs, while also acquiring in vivo molecular imaging data. The technique uses a time series of images acquired after injection of an inert dye. Differences in the dye's in vivo biodistribution dynamics allow precise delineation and identification of major organs. Such co-registered anatomical maps permit longitudinal organ identification irrespective of repositioning or weight gain, thereby promising greatly improved accuracy and versatility for studies of orthotopic disease, diagnostics and therapies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Columbia University, 1210 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, New York, 10027, USA"", ""authors"": [""Elizabeth M.

letter,Sensitive solution-processed visible-wavelength photodetectors,"<p>One billion image sensors worldwide render optical images as digital photographs in video cameras, still cameras and camera phones. These silicon-based sensors monolithically integrate photodetection with electronic readout. However, silicon photodiodes rely on a smaller bandgap than that required for visible detection; this degrades visible-wavelength sensitivity and produces unwanted infrared sensitivity. Thin-film top-surface visible photodetectors have therefore been investigated based on amorphous, organic and colloidal quantum-dot semiconductors. However, none of these devices has exhibited visible sensitivity approaching that of silicon. Here we report a sensitive solution-processed photodetector that, across the entire visible spectrum, exhibits D* (normalized detectivity) greater than 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>12</sup> Jones (a unit of detectivity equivalent to cm&#160;Hz<sup>1/2</sup>&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). A photoconductive gain of &gt;100 has been measured, facilitating high-fidelity electronic readout, and the linear dynamic range is greater than 60&#160;dB, as required for high-contrast applications. These photodetectors are also compatible with flexible organic-based electronics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 10 King's College Road, Toronto, M5S 3G4, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Gerasimos Konstantatos"", "",\u00a0Jason Clifford"", "",\u00a0Larissa Levina"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Edward H.

letter,All-dielectric photonic-assisted radio front-end technology,"<p>The threats to civil society posed by high-power electromagnetic weapons are viewed as a grim but real possibility in the world after 11 September 2001 (refs&#160;). These weapons produce a power surge capable of destroying or damaging sensitive circuitry in electronic systems. Unfortunately, the trend towards circuits with smaller sizes and voltages renders modern electronics highly susceptible to such damage. Radiofrequency communication systems are particularly vulnerable, because the antenna provides a direct port of entry for electromagnetic radiation. Here, we report a type of radiofrequency receiver front end featuring a complete absence of electronic circuitry and metal interconnects, the traditional &#8216;soft spots&#8217; of a conventional radiofrequency receiver. The device exploits a dielectric resonator antenna to capture and deliver the radiofrequency signal onto an electro&#8211;optic field sensor. The dielectric approach has an added benefit in that it reduces the physical size of the front end, an important benefit in mobile applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095-1594, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Rick C.

article,Attosecond nanoplasmonic-field microscope,"<p>Nanoplasmonics deals with collective electronic dynamics on the surface of metal nanostructures, which arises as a result of excitations called surface plasmons. This field, which has recently undergone rapid growth, could benefit applications such as computing and information storage on the nanoscale, the ultrasensitive detection and spectroscopy of physical, chemical and biological nanosized objects, and the development of optoelectronic devices. Because of their broad spectral bandwidth, surface plasmons undergo ultrafast dynamics with timescales as short as a few hundred attoseconds. So far, the spatiotemporal dynamics of optical fields localized on the nanoscale has been hidden from direct access in the real space and time domain. Here, we propose an approach that will, for the first time, provide direct, non-invasive access to the nanoplasmonic collective dynamics, with nanometre-scale spatial resolution and temporal resolution on the order of 100 attoseconds. The method, which combines photoelectron emission microscopy and attosecond streaking spectroscopy, offers a valuable way of probing nanolocalized optical fields that will be interesting both from a fundamental point of view and in light of the existing and potential applications of nanoplasmonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University, Atlanta, 30303, Georgia, USA"", ""authors"": [""Mark I.
