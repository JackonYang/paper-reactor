letter,Slow guided surface plasmons at telecom frequencies,"<p>The phenomenon of slow light is interesting not only from a fundamental physics standpoint, but also because it introduces the possibility of new applications in telecommunications. For a practical slow-light device, the important features are bandwidth, range of wavelength tunability and size, rather than the absolute slowdown factor achieved. Slow light can be achieved in three main ways: through quantum interference effects, which can slow the speed of light down to several metres per second, albeit within a very narrow bandwidth; by using photonic crystals, which are able to slow light over large bandwidths but with much smaller slowdown factors; and by using stimulated Brillouin or Raman scattering. Surface plasmon polaritons have the advantage that they can overcome the diffraction limit of light in a microchip-sized device. Increases in the propagation lengths of surface plasmon polaritons and the feasibility of all-optical wavelength tunability have been reported. Here we report the observation of slow, femtosecond surface-plasmon-polariton wavepackets. We show that a highly compact (55&#160;&#181;m length) plasmonic structure is able to achieve an effective slowdown factor of two over a 4&#160;THz bandwidth. These results will increase the scope of photonic devices based on surface plasmon polaritons.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF), Kruislaan 407, Amsterdam, 1098 SJ, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""M.

letter,Measuring optical frequencies in the 0–40 THz range with non-synchronized electro–optic sampling,"<p>Measurements using optical frequency combs are now important in high-precision spectroscopy. However, measurement techniques described so far are either restricted to narrow frequency ranges or are difficult to implement in the far-infrared regime. Here we present a time-domain method for the direct measurement of optical frequencies in the mid- and far-infrared spectral region. The method is analogous to a sampling scope, with the electric field of the source measured by electro&#8211;optic sampling using the light pulses from a femtosecond laser as a probe. The highest optical frequency that can be measured with our &#8216;sampling scope&#8217; is determined by the pulse length of the femtosecond laser. When 12-fs probe pulses are used, a measurement of up to 40&#160;THz, corresponding to a wavelength of 7.5&#160;&#181;m, is possible.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Born-Institut f\u00fcr Nichtlineare Optik und Kurzzeitspektroskopie, Berlin, 12489, Germany"", ""authors"": [""P.

letter,Direct imaging of carrier motion in organic transistors by optical second-harmonic generation,"<p>Interest in the dynamic behaviour of carriers in organic materials is motivated by possible applications that include organic thin-film transistors, organic electro-luminescent devices and organic photoconductors. It can also provide an insight into the modelling of carrier transport and trapping in organic semiconductors and insulators. Here, we use an advanced second-harmonic generation technique to probe and visualize real carrier motion in organic materials. This is a time-resolved microscopic optical second-harmonic generation technique that allows direct and selective probing of dynamic carrier motion in organic materials. Experiments making use of this technique and using pentacene field-effect transistors have revealed dynamic changes of second-harmonic-generation intensity profiles arising from pentacene. Carrier velocity in organic solids is thus determined from the visualized carrier motion. We anticipate that this direct visualization technique will find wide application in the illustration of space-charge field formation in organic and inorganic materials, including biomaterials and polymers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physical Electronics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 O-okayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 152-8552, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takaaki Manaka"", "",\u00a0Eunju Lim"", "",\u00a0Ryousuke Tamura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mitsumasa Iwamoto""]}]",False,"[""Takaaki Manaka"", ""Eunju Lim"", ""Ryousuke Tamura"", ""Mitsumasa Iwamoto""]","Manaka, T., Lim, E., Tamura, R. et al.

letter,"Photon-number-discriminating detection using a quantum-dot, optically gated, field-effect transistor","<p>Detectors with the capability to directly measure the photon number of a pulse of light enable linear optics quantum computing, affect the security of quantum communications, and can be used to characterize and herald non-classical states of light. Here, we demonstrate the photon-number-resolving capabilities of a quantum-dot, optically gated, field-effect transistor that uses quantum dots as optically addressable floating gates in a GaAs/Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>As &#948;-doped field-effect transistor. When the active area of the detector is illuminated, photo-generated carriers trapped by quantum dots screen the gate field, causing a persistent change in the channel current that is proportional to the number of confined carriers. Using weak laser pulses, we show that discrete numbers of trapped carriers produce well resolved changes in the channel current. We demonstrate that for a mean photon number of 1.1, decision regions can be defined such that the field-effect transistor determines the number of detected photons with a probability of accuracy greater than 83%.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optoelectronics Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, 80305, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""E.

article,Lasing in metallic-coated nanocavities,"<p>Metallic cavities can confine light to volumes with dimensions considerably smaller than the wavelength of light. It is commonly believed, however, that the high losses in metals are prohibitive for laser operation in small metallic cavities. Here we report for the first time laser operation in an electrically pumped metallic-coated nanocavity formed by a semiconductor heterostructure encapsulated in a thin gold film. The demonstrated lasers show a low threshold current and their dimensions are smaller than the smallest electrically pumped lasers reported so far. With dimensions comparable to state-of-the-art electronic transistors and operating at low power and high speed, they are a strong contender as basic elements in digital photonic very large-scale integration. Furthermore we demonstrate that metallic-coated nanocavities with modal volumes smaller than dielectric cavities can have moderate quality factors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""COBRA Research Institute, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Postbus 513, Eindhoven, 5600, MB, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Martin T.
