letter,Subpicotesla atomic magnetometry with a microfabricated vapour cell,"<p>Highly sensitive magnetometers capable of measuring magnetic fields below 1&#160;pT have an impact on areas as diverse as geophysical surveying, the detection of unexploded ordinance, space science, nuclear magnetic resonance, health care and perimeter and remote monitoring. Recently, it has been shown that laboratory optical magnetometers, based on the precession of the spins of alkali atoms in the vapour phase, could achieve sensitivities in the femtotesla range, comparable to, or even exceeding, those of superconducting quantum interference devices. We demonstrate here an atomic magnetometer based on a millimetre-scale microfabricated alkali vapour cell with sensitivity below 70&#160;fT&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>. Additionally, we use a simplified optical configuration that requires only a single low-power laser. This result suggests that millimetre-scale, low-power femtotesla magnetometers are feasible, and we support this proposition with a simple sensitivity scaling analysis. Such an instrument would greatly expand the range of applications in which atomic magnetometers could be used.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Standards and Technology, 325 Broadway, Boulder, 80305, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Vishal Shah"", "",\u00a0Svenja Knappe"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0John Kitching""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Colorado, Boulder, 80309, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Vishal Shah""]}, {""address"": ""Sandia National Laboratories, MS 1082, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, 87185, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""Peter D.

letter,Light trapping in gravity-like potentials and expansion of supercontinuum spectra in photonic-crystal fibres,"<p>Femtosecond pulses of light propagating along photonic-crystal fibres can generate a broad optical supercontinuum. This striking discovery has applications ranging from spectroscopy and metrology to telecommunication and medicine. Among the physical principles underlying supercontinuum generation are soliton emission, a variety of four-wave mixing processes, Raman-induced soliton self-frequency shift, and dispersive wave generation mediated by solitons. Although all of the above effects contribute to supercontinuum generation, none of them can explain the generation of blue and violet light from infrared femtosecond pump pulses. In this work we argue that the most profound role in the shaping of the short-wavelength edge of the continuum is played by the effect of radiation trapping in a gravity-like potential created by accelerating solitons. The underlying physics of this effect has a straightforward analogy with the inertial forces acting on an observer moving with a constant acceleration.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Centre for Photonics and Photonic Materials, University of Bath, Bath, BA2 7AY, UK"", ""authors"": [""A.

article,"Trapping, corralling and spectral bonding of optical resonances through optically induced potentials","<p>Optical forces resulting from interacting modes and cavities can scale to remarkably large values as the optical modes shrink to nanometre dimensions. Such forces can be harnessed in fundamentally new ways when optical elements can freely adapt to them. Here, we propose the use of optomechanically coupled resonators as a general means of tailoring optomechanical potentials through the action of optical forces. We show that significant attractive and repulsive forces arising from optomechanically coupled cavity resonances can give rise to strong and highly localized optomechanical potential wells whose widths can approach picometre scales. These potentials enable unique all-optical self-adaptive behaviours, such as the trapping and corralling (or dynamic capture) of microcavity resonances with light. It is shown, for example, that a resonator can be designed to dynamically self-align (or spectrally bond) its resonance to an incident laser line. Although these concepts are illustrated through dual-microring cavity designs, broad extension to other photonic topologies can be made.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Peter T.
