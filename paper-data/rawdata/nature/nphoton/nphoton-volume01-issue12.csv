letter,Plasmonic all-optical tunable wavelength shifter,"<p>At present, wavelength-division-multiplexed fibre lines routinely operate at 10&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> per channel. The transition from static-path networks to true all-optical networks encompassing many nodes, in which channels are added/dropped and efficiently reassigned, will require improved tools for all-optical wavelength shifting. Specifically, one must be able to shift the carrier wavelength (frequency) of an optical data signal over tens of nanometres (a THz range) without the bottleneck of electrical conversion. Popular approaches to this problem make use of the nonlinear interaction between two wavelengths within a semiconductor optical amplifier whereas more novel methods invoke terahertz-frequency electro&#8211;optic modulation and polaritons. Here we outline the principles and demonstrate the use of optically excited plasmons as a tunable frequency source that can be mixed with a laser frequency through Raman scattering. The scheme is all-optical and enables dynamical control of the output carrier wavelength simply by varying the power of a control laser.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 1617 Cole Blvd, Golden, 80401, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""B.

letter,High-frequency single-photon source with polarization control,"<p>Optoelectronic devices that provide non-classical light states on demand have a broad range of applications in quantum information science, including quantum&#8208;key&#8208;distribution systems, quantum lithography and quantum computing. Single-photon sources in particular have been demonstrated to outperform key distribution based on attenuated classical laser pulses. Implementations based on individual molecules, nitrogen vacancy centres or dopant atoms are rather inefficient owing to low emission rates, rapid saturation and the lack of mature cavity technology. Promising single-photon-source designs combine high-quality microcavities with quantum dots as active emitters. So far, the highest measured single-photon rates are &#8764; 200 kHz using etched micropillars. Here, we demonstrate a quantum-dot-based single-photon source with a measured single-photon emission rate of 4.0&#160;MHz (31&#160;MHz into the first lens, with an extraction efficiency of 38%) due to the suppression of exciton dark states. Furthermore, our microcavity design provides mechanical stability, and voltage-controlled tuning of the emitter/mode resonance and of the polarization state.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, 93106, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Stefan Strauf"", "",\u00a0Matthew T.

article,Three-dimensional endomicroscopy using optical coherence tomography,"<p>Optical coherence tomography enables micrometre-scale, subsurface imaging of biological tissue by measuring the magnitude and echo time delay of backscattered light. Endoscopic optical coherence tomography imaging inside the body can be performed using fibre-optic probes. To perform three-dimensional optical coherence tomography endomicroscopy with ultrahigh volumetric resolution, however, requires extremely high imaging speeds. Here we report advances in optical coherence tomography technology using a Fourier-domain mode-locked frequency-swept laser as the light source. The laser, with a 160-nm tuning range at a wavelength of 1,315&#160;nm, can produce images with axial resolutions of 5&#8211;7&#160;&#181;m. In vivo three-dimensional optical coherence tomography endomicroscopy is demonstrated at speeds of 100,000 axial lines per second and 50 frames per second. This enables virtual manipulation of tissue geometry, speckle reduction, synthesis of en face views similar to endoscopic images, generation of cross-sectional images with arbitrary orientation, and quantitative measurements of morphology. This technology can be scaled to even higher speeds and will open up three-dimensional optical-coherence-tomography endomicroscopy to a wide range of medical applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Desmond C.

article,"Bright, multicoloured light-emitting diodes based on quantum dots","<p>Quantum-dot-based LEDs are characterized by pure and saturated emission colours with narrow bandwidth, and their emission wavelength is easily tuned by changing the size of the quantum dots. However, the brightness, efficiency and lifetime of LEDs need to be improved to meet the requirements of commercialization in the near future. Here, we report red, orange, yellow and green LEDs with maximum luminance values of 9,064, 3,200, 4,470 and 3,700&#160;cd&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, respectively, the highest values reported so far. Solution-processable core&#8211;shell quantum dots with a CdSe core and a ZnS or CdS/ZnS shell were used as emissive layers in the devices. By optimizing the thicknesses of the constituent layers of the devices, we were able to develop quantum-dot-based LEDs with improved electroluminescent efficiency (1.1&#8211;2.8&#160;cd&#160;A<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), low turn-on voltages (3&#8211;4&#160;V) and long operation lifetimes.

article,Miniaturized all-fibre probe for three-dimensional optical trapping and manipulation,"<p>Optical tweezers represent a powerful tool for a variety of applications both in biology and in physics. Standard optical tweezers make use of a freely propagating laser beam that is tightly focused near the sample by means of a high-numerical-aperture microscope objective. Most of the limitations associated with the microscope's bulky structure could be overcome by exploiting optical fibres for the delivery of the trapping radiation, provided that proper beam-shaping is performed. Here we present the design and the realization of a miniaturized single-fibre optical tweezer that is able to create a purely optical three-dimensional trap. The tweezer uses engineered fibre structures with microstructured end surfaces, and its effectiveness is demonstrated by trapping 10-&#181;m-diameter polystyrene beads. The optical tweezer is able to provide optical manipulation and analysis of microscale specimens and could be the fundamental building block in future integrated fibre-based devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Medicina Sperimentale e Clinica, Universit\u00e0 della Magna Graecia, BIONEM Lab, Viale Europa, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Carlo Liberale"", "",\u00a0Francesco  De Angelis"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Enzo Di Fabrizio""]}, {""address"": ""CNISM and Electronics Department, University of Pavia, Via Ferrata 1, Pavia, 27100, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Paolo Minzioni"", "",\u00a0Francesca Bragheri"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ilaria Cristiani""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratorio TASC-INFM Area Science Park, S.S. 14, km 163.5 Basovizza, Trieste, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Enzo Di Fabrizio""]}]",False,"[""Carlo Liberale"", ""Paolo Minzioni"", ""Francesca Bragheri"", ""Francesco  De Angelis"", ""Enzo Di Fabrizio"", ""Ilaria Cristiani""]","Liberale, C., Minzioni, P., Bragheri, F. et al.
