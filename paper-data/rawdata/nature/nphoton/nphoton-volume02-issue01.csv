letter,Signal regeneration using low-power four-wave mixing on silicon chip,"<p>To meet the increasing demand for higher capacity in optical communications, signal transmission at higher modulation rates and over a broader wavelength range will be required. Signal degradation in the optical channel caused by dispersion, nonlinearity and noise becomes a critical issue as data rates increase. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop broadband, high-speed regeneration devices. Recent advances in silicon-on-insulator photonic devices offer the potential for highly integrated, robust opto&#8211;electronic architectures, and optical processes such as amplification, wavelength conversion and amplitude modulation have already been demonstrated in such structures. In this work, we demonstrate two regeneration schemes using low-power four-wave mixing in a silicon nanowaveguide and compensate for the effects of poor extinction ratio, dispersive broadening and timing jitter. This capability further expands the range of optical functions that can be incorporated into silicon-compatible photonic devices offering a broadband and integrated solution for regeneration.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, New York, 14853, Ithaca, USA"", ""authors"": [""Reza Salem"", "",\u00a0Mark A.

letter,Confocal Brillouin microscopy for three-dimensional mechanical imaging,"<p>Acoustically induced inelastic light scattering, first reported in 1922 by Brillouin, allows non-contact, direct readout of the viscoelastic properties of a material and has widely been investigated for material characterization, structural monitoring and environmental sensing. Extending the Brillouin technique from point sampling spectroscopy to imaging modality would open up new possibilities for mechanical imaging, but has been challenging because rapid spectrum acquisition is required. Here, we demonstrate a confocal Brillouin microscope based on a fully parallel spectrometer&#8212;a virtually imaged phased array&#8212;that improves the detection efficiency by nearly 100-fold over previous approaches. Using the system, we show the first cross-sectional Brillouin imaging based on elastic properties as the contrast mechanism and monitor fast dynamic changes in elastic modulus during polymer crosslinking. Furthermore, we report the first in situ biomechanical measurement of the crystalline lens in a mouse eye. These results suggest multiple applications of Brillouin microscopy in biomedical and biomaterial science.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, 02114, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Giuliano Scarcelli"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Seok Hyun Yun""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Dermatology, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, 02114, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Giuliano Scarcelli"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Seok Hyun Yun""]}]",False,"[""Giuliano Scarcelli"", ""Seok Hyun Yun""]","Scarcelli, G., Yun, S.

letter,Firefly bioluminescence quantum yield and colour change by pH-sensitive green emission,"<p>Firefly bioluminescence is the most well-known ideal photo-emitter system in biophotonics, known in particular for its extremely high quantum yield, 88&#160;&#177;&#160;25% (refs&#160;) or higher, and its magnificent pH-dependent emission-colour change between yellow-green and red, modelled as the chemical equilibrium between two corresponding states. However, the need for re-examination has also been discussed. In this letter we quantify quantum yields and colour changes using our new total-photon-flux spectrometer. We determine the highest quantum yield to be 41.0&#160;&#177;&#160;7.4% (1 standard deviation (s.d.) estimate, coverage factor k =&#160;1), and find that bioluminescence spectra are systematically decomposed into one pH-sensitive and two pH-insensitive gaussian components. There is no intensity conversion between yellow-green and red emissions through pH equilibrium, but simple intensity variation of the pH-sensitive gaussian peak at 2.2&#160;eV causes the changes in emission colours. This represents a paradigm shift in the concept of colour determination from long-standing interpretation based on pH equilibrium.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, and CREST, JST, Kashiwa, 277-8581, Chiba, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yoriko Ando"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hidefumi Akiyama""]}, {""address"": ""Research Institute for Cell Engineering, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ikeda, 563-8577, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuki Niwa""]}, {""address"": ""ATTO Corporation, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8425, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Nobuyuki Yamada"", "",\u00a0Toshiteru Enomoto"", "",\u00a0Tsutomu Irie"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hidehiro Kubota""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Photobiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, North 15, West 7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-8638, Hokkaido, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yoshihiro Ohmiya""]}]",False,"[""Yoriko Ando"", ""Kazuki Niwa"", ""Nobuyuki Yamada"", ""Toshiteru Enomoto"", ""Tsutomu Irie"", ""Hidehiro Kubota"", ""Yoshihiro Ohmiya"", ""Hidefumi Akiyama""]","Ando, Y., Niwa, K., Yamada, N. et al.

letter,Amplified wavelength–time transformation for real-time spectroscopy,"<p>Real-time spectroscopy provides invaluable information about the evolution of dynamical processes, especially non-repetitive phenomena. Unfortunately, the continuous acquisition of rapidly varying spectra represents an extremely difficult challenge. One method, wavelength&#8211;time mapping, chirps the spectrum so that it can be measured using a single-shot oscilloscope. Here, we demonstrate a method that overcomes a fundamental problem that has previously plagued wavelength&#8211;time spectroscopy: fine spectral resolution requires large dispersion, which is accompanied by extreme optical loss. The present technique uses an optically amplified wavelength&#8211;time transformation to beat the dispersion-loss trade-off and facilitate high-resolution, broadband, real-time applications. We show that this distributed amplification process can even be pumped by broadband noise, generating a wide gain bandwidth using a single pump source. We apply these techniques to demonstrate real-time stimulated Raman spectroscopy. Amplified wavelength&#8211;time Raman spectroscopy creates new opportunities for the study of chemical and physical dynamics in real time.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""D.

article,Embedded cavities and waveguides in three-dimensional silicon photonic crystals,"<p>To fulfil the promise that complete-photonic-bandgap materials hold for optoelectronics applications, the incorporation of three-dimensionally engineered defects must be realized. Previous attempts to create and characterize such defects were limited because of fabrication challenges. Here we report the optical and structural characterization of complex submicrometre features of unprecedented quality within silicon inverse opals. High-resolution three-dimensional features are first formed within a silica colloidal crystal by means of two-photon polymerization, followed by a high-index replication step and removal of the opal template to yield embedded defects in three-dimensional silicon photonic crystals. We demonstrate the coupling of bandgap frequencies to resonant modes in planar optical cavities and the first waveguiding of near-infrared light around sharp bends in a complete-photonic-bandgap material.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Beckman Institute, and Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Stephanie A.
