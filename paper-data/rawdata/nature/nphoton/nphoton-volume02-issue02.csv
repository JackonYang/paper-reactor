review article,Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes based on group three nitrides,"<p>Light-emitting diodes with emission wavelengths less than 400 nm have been developed using the AlInGaN material system. For devices operating at shorter wavelengths, alloy compositions with a greater aluminium content are required. The material properties of these materials lie on the border between conventional semiconductors and insulators, which adds a degree of complexity to the development of efficient light-emitting devices. A number of technical developments have enabled the fabrication of LEDs based on group three nitrides (III-nitrides) that emit in the UV part of the spectrum, providing useful tools for a wealth of applications in optoelectronic systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, 29208, South Carolina, USA"", ""authors"": [""Asif Khan"", "",\u00a0Krishnan Balakrishnan"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tom Katona""]}]",False,"[""Asif Khan"", ""Krishnan Balakrishnan"", ""Tom Katona""]","Khan, A., Balakrishnan, K. & Katona, T.

letter,Dynamic manipulation and separation of individual semiconducting and metallic nanowires,"<p>The synthesis of nanowires has advanced in the past decade to the point where a vast range of insulating, semiconducting and metallic materials are available for use in integrated, heterogeneous optoelectronic devices at nanometre scales. However, a persistent challenge has been the development of a general strategy for the manipulation of individual nanowires with arbitrary composition. Here we report that individual semiconducting and metallic nanowires with diameters below 20&#160;nm are addressable with forces generated by optoelectronic tweezers. Using 100,000 times less optical power density than optical tweezers, optoelectronic tweezers are capable of transporting individual nanowires with speeds four times greater than the maximum speeds achieved by optical tweezers. A real-time array of silver nanowires is formed using photopatterned virtual electrodes, demonstrating the potential for massively parallel assemblies. Furthermore, optoelectronic tweezers enable the separation of semiconducting and metallic nanowires, suggesting a broad range of applications for the separation and heterogeneous integration of one-dimensional nanoscale materials.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, California, Berkeley, 94720, USA"", ""authors"": [""Arash Jamshidi"", "",\u00a0Aaron T.

letter,Localization in silicon nanophotonic slow-light waveguides,"<p>Slowing down light on a chip can lead to the development of optical buffers, filters and memory elements useful for optical interconnects and for resonantly enhanced chip-based nonlinear optics. Several approaches to slow light rely on the phenomenon of light interference in a sequence of coupled resonators; however, light interference is also responsible, in disordered structures, for the localization of light, an effect particularly prominent in one-dimensional devices. Until now, the length of the waveguides investigated has been less than the localization length. Here we report the first observation of light localization in compact silicon nanophotonic slow-light waveguides consisting of long sequences of coupled resonators. Our results show that disorder limits how much light can be slowed, and that localization leads to spatially concentrated and locally trapped light in a quasi-one-dimensional waveguide at wavelengths near the band edge.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""University of California, San Diego, Electrical Engineering, Mail Code 0407, La Jolla, 92093-0407, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Shayan Mookherjea"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jung S.

letter,"Phase-coherent, injection-seeded, table-top soft-X-ray lasers at 18.9 nm and 13.9 nm","<p>There is keen interest in generating intense, coherent, soft-X-ray beams for scientific and measurement applications. Here, we report the demonstration of soft-X-ray lasers with essentially full spatial and temporal coherence operating at wavelengths below 20&#160;nm, and in particular within the 13-nm spectral region, which is important for the manufacturing of computer chips using extreme uv lithography. Gain-saturated pulses were produced in dense laser-created plasmas by amplifying high-harmonic seed pulses in the 18.9-nm and 13.9-nm transitions of nickel-like molybdenum and silver ions, respectively. These results, obtained using an injection seeding technique that can also be applied to improve the temporal coherence of free-electron lasers, extend our ability to generate bright phase-coherent laser beams to significantly shorter wavelengths. Moreover, the experiments were conducted using a practical table-top laser. These compact soft-X-ray lasers offer new scientific opportunities, such as high-resolution coherent imaging and phase-coherent probing of atomic and molecular systems, in small laboratory environments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Science and Technology and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, 80523, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Y.

article,Non-reciprocal ultrafast laser writing,"<p>Photosensitivity is a material property that is relevant to many phenomena and applications, from photosynthesis and photography to optical data storage and ultrafast laser writing. It was commonly thought that, in a homogeneous medium, photosensitivity and the corresponding light-induced material modifications do not change on reversing the direction of light propagation. Here we demonstrate that when the direction of the femtosecond laser beam is reversed from the +z to &#8211;z direction, the structures written in LiNbO<sub>3</sub> crystal when translating the beam along the +y and &#8211;y directions are mirrored. In a non-centrosymmetric medium, modification of the material can therefore differ for light propagating in opposite directions. This is the first evidence of a new optical phenomenon of non-reciprocal photosensitivity. We interpret this effect in terms of light pressure and associated heat flow, resulting in a temperature gradient in homogeneous media without inversion symmetry under uniform intense irradiation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK"", ""authors"": [""Weijia Yang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Peter G.

article,Space-separated quantum cutting with silicon nanocrystals for photovoltaic applications,"<p>For optimal energy conversion in photovoltaic devices (electricity to and from light) one important requirement is that the full energy of the photons is used. However, in solar cells, a single electron&#8211;hole pair of specific energy is generated when the incoming photon energy is above a certain threshold, with the excess energy being lost to heat. In the so-called quantum-cutting process, a high-energy photon can be divided into two, or more, photons of lower energy. Such manipulation of photon quantum size can then very effectively increase the overall efficiency of a device. In the current work, we demonstrate (space-separated) photon cutting by silicon nanocrystals, in which nearby Er<sup>3+</sup> ions and neighbouring nanocrystals are used to detect this effect.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Van der Waals\u2013Zeeman Institute, University of Amsterdam, Valckenierstraat 65, XE Amsterdam, NL-1018, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""D.

article,Optical phase conjugation for turbidity suppression in biological samples,"<p>Elastic optical scattering, the dominant light-interaction process in biological tissues, prevents tissues from being transparent. Although scattering may appear stochastic, it is in fact deterministic in nature. We show that, despite experimental imperfections, optical phase conjugation (&#955; = 532 nm) can force a transmitted light field to retrace its trajectory through a biological target and recover the original light field. For a 0.69-mm-thick chicken breast tissue section, we can enhance point-source light return by a factor of &#8764;5&#215;10<sup>3</sup> and achieve a light transmission enhancement factor of 3.8 within a collection angle of 29&#176;. Additionally, we find that the reconstruction's quality, measured by the width of the reconstructed point source, is independent of tissue thickness (up to a thickness of 0.69&#160;mm). This phenomenon may be used to enhance light transmission through tissue, enable measurement of small tissue movements, and form the basis of new tissue imaging techniques.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, 1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, 91125, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Zahid Yaqoob"", "",\u00a0Demetri Psaltis"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Changhuei Yang""]}, {""address"": ""School of Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Demetri Psaltis""]}, {""address"": ""Massachusetts Institute of Technology, G.
