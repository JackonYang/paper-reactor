letter,Plasmonic photon sorters for spectral and polarimetric imaging,"<p>Colour cameras mimic the human eye and record only a small part of the information contained in the incoming light. Modern image sensing techniques, which subdivide the light spectrally or record information about the polarization of the incoming light, can extract much more information for applications ranging from biological studies to remote sensing. Spectral imaging techniques typically rely on filters or interferometers combined with scanning or subsampling to record a spectral image &#8216;cube&#8217; (which has wavelength as a third dimension). This leads to inefficient use of the incoming light and/or long recording times. Here, we show that surface plasmons enable direct recording of spectral image cubes in a single exposure. By texturing metal surfaces at the nanometre scale, incoming light is converted to surface plasmons and can then be separated according to wavelength and polarization, before being recoupled to light through subwavelength apertures that illuminate individual photodetector elements. This photon-sorting capability provides a new approach for spectral and polarimetric imaging with extremely compact device archictures.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ISIS, Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur and CNRS, Strasbourg, 67000, France"", ""authors"": [""Eric Laux"", "",\u00a0Cyriaque Genet"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Thomas W.

letter,A femtosecond X-ray/optical cross-correlator,"<p>For a fundamental understanding of ultrafast dynamics in chemistry, biology and materials science it has been a long-standing dream to record a molecular movie in which both the atomic trajectories and the chemical states of every atom in matter are followed in real time. Free-electron lasers provide this perspective as they deliver brilliant femtosecond X-ray pulses spanning a wide photon energy range, which is necessary to gather element-specific and chemical-state-selective information with femtosecond time resolution. The key challenge lies in synchronizing the free-electron lasers with separate optical lasers. We exploit the peak brilliance of the free-electron laser in Hamburg (FLASH) and establish X-ray- pulse-induced transient changes of the optical reflectivity in GaAs as a powerful tool for X-ray/optical cross-correlation.

letter,A cascaded silicon Raman laser,"<p>One of the major advantages of Raman lasers is their ability to generate coherent light in wavelength regions that are not easily accessible with other conventional types of lasers. Recently, efficient Raman lasing in silicon in the near-infrared region has been demonstrated, showing great potential for realizing low-cost, compact, room-temperature lasers in the mid-infrared region. Such lasers are highly desirable for many applications, ranging from trace-gas sensing, environmental monitoring and biomedical analysis, to industrial process control, and free-space communications. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of cascaded Raman lasing in silicon, opening the path to extending the lasing wavelength from the near- to mid-infrared region. Using a 1,550-nm pump source, we achieve stable, continuous-wave, second-order cascaded lasing at 1,848&#160;nm with an output power exceeding 5&#160;mW.

letter,Highly confined guiding of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons on structured metal surfaces,"<p>Metamaterials are artificial materials with subwavelength structure that enable the translation of magnetic and electric responses into spectral regions not accessible through naturally occurring materials. Here, we report direct measurements of the propagation and confinement of terahertz electromagnetic surface modes tightly bound to flat plasmonic metamaterials that consist of metal surfaces decorated with two-dimensional arrays of subwavelength-periodicity pits. These modes are surface plasmon polaritons with an effective plasma frequency controlled entirely by the surface geometry. The mode spectrum and penetration depth into air demonstrate strong wavelength-scale energy confinement to the surface below the electromagnetic band edge; this is in stark contrast to the very weak confinement found at flat metal surfaces in this spectral regime. The results are in good agreement with analytical and numerical models of surface plasmon polaritons propagating on structured perfect-conductor surfaces, and imply that plasmonic metamaterials could help miniaturize optical components or lead to improved chemical or biochemical sensors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Bath, Bath, BA2 7AY, UK"", ""authors"": [""C.

letter,A nanoelectromechanical tunable laser,"<p>The ability to tune the frequency of an oscillator is of critical importance and is a fundamental building block for many systems, be they mechanical or electronic. However, this very important function is still highly inadequate in optical oscillators, particularly in semiconductor laser diodes. The limitations in tuning a laser frequency (or wavelength) include the tuning range and the speed of tuning, which is typically milliseconds or slower. In addition, the tuning is often not continuous and may require complex synchronization of several electrical control signals. In this Letter, we present a new tunable laser structure with a lightweight nanoelectromechanical mirror based on a single-layer, high-contrast subwavelength grating. The high-contrast subwavelength grating reflector enables a drastic reduction of the mirror mass, which increases the mechanical resonant frequency and hence tuning speed. This allows for a wavelength-tunable light source with potential switching speeds of the order of tens of nanoseconds and suggests various new areas of practical application, such as bio- or chemical sensing, chip-scale atomic clocks and projection displays.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, California, 94720, USA"", ""authors"": [""Michael C.

letter,Picosecond and low-power all-optical switching based on an organic photonic-bandgap microcavity,"<p>Photonic crystals, materials with periodic dielectric structures, are able to control the propagation states of photons owing to the so-called photonic-bandgap effect. Nonlinear photonic crystals, whose refractive-index distribution can be tuned optically, have been used to demonstrate all-optical switching. However, a high pump intensity is usually required because the nonlinear optical coefficient of conventional materials is relatively small. Here we report ultrafast and low-power photonic-crystal all-optical switching based on strong optical nonlinearity enhancement due to excited-state interelectron transfer. Compared with the case without nonlinearity enhancement, the switching operation power is reduced by four orders of magnitude while the ultrafast response time, of the order of a picosecond, is maintained. This provides a strategy for constructing photonic materials with large nonlinearity and studying ultrafast low-power integrated photonic devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, State Key Laboratory for Mesoscopic Physics, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, P.

article,Non-scanning motionless fluorescence three-dimensional holographic microscopy,"<p>Holography is an attractive imaging technique as it offers the ability to view a complete three-dimensional volume from one image. However, holography is not widely applied to the field of three-dimensional fluorescence microscopic imaging, because fluorescence is incoherent and creating holograms requires a coherent interferometer system. Although scanning one beam of an interferometer pattern across the rear aperture of an objective to excite fluorescence in a specimen overcomes the coherence limitation, the mechanical scanning is complicated, which makes the image capturing slow, and the process is limited to low-numerical-aperture objectives. Here we present the first demonstration of a motionless microscopy system (FINCHSCOPE) based on Fresnel incoherent correlation holography, and its use in recording high-resolution three-dimensional fluorescent images of biological specimens. By using high-numerical-aperture objectives, a spatial light modulator, a CCD camera and some simple filters, FINCHSCOPE enables the acquisition of three-dimensional microscopic images without the need for scanning.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Johns Hopkins University Microscopy Center, Montgomery County Campus 9605 Medical Center Drive Suite 240, Rockville, 20850, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Joseph Rosen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gary Brooker""]}, {""address"": ""Johns Hopkins University Department of Chemistry, Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, and Advanced Technology Laboratory, Whiting School of Engineering, Baltimore, Maryland 21211, USA"", ""authors"": [""Joseph Rosen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gary Brooker""]}]",False,"[""Joseph Rosen"", ""Gary Brooker""]","Rosen, J., Brooker, G.
