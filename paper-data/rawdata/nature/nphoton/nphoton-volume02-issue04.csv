letter,Nanometre-scale germanium photodetector enhanced by a near-infrared dipole antenna,"<p>A critical challenge for the convergence of optics and electronics is that the micrometre scale of optics is significantly larger than the nanometre scale of modern electronic devices. In the conversion from photons to electrons by photodetectors, this size incompatibility often leads to substantial penalties in power dissipation, area, latency and noise. A photodetector can be made smaller by using a subwavelength active region; however, this can result in very low responsivity because of the diffraction limit of the light. Here we exploit the idea of a half-wave Hertz dipole antenna (length &#8764; 380 nm) from radio waves, but at near-infrared wavelengths (length &#8764; 1.3 &#181;m), to concentrate radiation into a nanometre-scale germanium photodetector. This gives a polarization contrast of a factor of 20 in the resulting photocurrent in the subwavelength germanium element, which has an active volume of 0.00072 &#181;m<sup>3</sup>, a size that is two orders of magnitude smaller than previously demonstrated detectors at such wavelengths.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ginzton Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Liang Tang"", "",\u00a0Sukru Ekin Kocabas"", "",\u00a0Salman Latif"", "",\u00a0Dany-Sebastien Ly-Gagnon"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0David A.

letter,Nanomechanical control of an optical antenna,"<p>Resonant optical nanoantennas hold great promise for applications in physics and chemistry. Their operation relies on their ability to concentrate light on spatial scales much smaller than the wavelength. In this work, we mechanically tune the length and gap between two triangles comprising a single gold bow-tie antenna by precise nanomanipulation with the tip of an atomic force microscope. At the same time, the optical response of the nanostructure is determined by means of dark-field scattering spectroscopy. We find no unique single &#8216;antenna resonance&#8217;. Instead, the plasmon mode splits into two dipole resonances for gap sizes on the order of a few tens of nanometres, governed by the full three-dimensional shape of the antenna arms. This result opens the door to new nano-optomechanical devices, where mechanical changes on the nanometre scale control the optical properties of artificial structures.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Center for Applied Photonics, University of Konstanz, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 10, Konstanz, D-78464, Germany"", ""authors"": [""J\u00f6rg Merlein"", "",\u00a0Matthias Kahl"", "",\u00a0Annika Zuschlag"", "",\u00a0Alexander Sell"", "",\u00a0Andreas Halm"", "",\u00a0Johannes Boneberg"", "",\u00a0Paul Leiderer"", "",\u00a0Alfred Leitenstorfer"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Rudolf Bratschitsch""]}]",False,"[""J\u00f6rg Merlein"", ""Matthias Kahl"", ""Annika Zuschlag"", ""Alexander Sell"", ""Andreas Halm"", ""Johannes Boneberg"", ""Paul Leiderer"", ""Alfred Leitenstorfer"", ""Rudolf Bratschitsch""]","Merlein, J., Kahl, M., Zuschlag, A. et al.

letter,Optical antennas direct single-molecule emission,"<p>Antennas have been used for more than a century to control the emission and collection of radio and microwave radiation. An optical analogue is of great interest as it will allow unique control of absorption and emission at the nanometre scale. Despite the intense recent research on optical antennas, one of the main functions of traditional antennas, the directing of radiation, remains a challenge at optical frequencies. Here we experimentally demonstrate control of the emission direction of individual molecules by reversible coupling to an optical monopole antenna. We show how the angular emission of the coupled system is determined by the dominant antenna mode&#8212;that is, the antenna design&#8212;regardless of molecular orientation. This result reveals the role of the plasmon mode in the emission process and provides a clear guideline how to exploit the large available library of radio antennas to direct emission in nano-optical microscopy, spectroscopy and light-emitting devices, including single-photon sources.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO \u2014 Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, Castelldefels, (Barcelona), 08860, Spain"", ""authors"": [""T.

letter,Observation of two-photon emission from semiconductors,"<p>Two-photon emission is a process in which electron transition between quantum levels occurs through the simultaneous emission of two photons. This phenomenon is important for astrophysics and atomic physics, and semiconductor two-photon emission was recently proposed as a compact source of entangled photons, essential for practical quantum information processing, and three orders of magnitude more efficient than the existing down-conversion schemes. Two-photon absorption in semiconductors has been extensively investigated; however, spontaneous semiconductor two-photon emission has not been observed, nor has it been fully analysed theoretically so far. We report the first experimental observations of two-photon emission from semiconductors and develop a corresponding theory. Spontaneous two-photon emission is demonstrated in optically pumped bulk GaAs and in electrically driven GaInP/AlGaInP quantum wells. Singly stimulated two-photon emission measurements demonstrate the theoretically predicted two-photon optical gain in semiconductors&#8212;a necessary ingredient for any realizations of future two-photon semiconductor lasers. A photon-coincidence experiment is presented to validate the simultaneity of the electrically driven GaInP/AlGaInP two-photon emission, limited only by the detector's temporal resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Haifa, 32000, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Alex Hayat"", "",\u00a0Pavel Ginzburg"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Meir Orenstein""]}]",False,"[""Alex Hayat"", ""Pavel Ginzburg"", ""Meir Orenstein""]","Hayat, A., Ginzburg, P. & Orenstein, M.

letter,High-throughput silicon nanophotonic wavelength-insensitive switch for on-chip optical networks,"<p>Recent advances in silicon nanophotonics, including demonstrations of ultracompact modulators, germanium waveguide photodetectors and wavelength-division multiplexers, indicate the feasibility of on-chip optical interconnects integrated with multicore microprocessors. Studies have suggested that direct replacement of part or all of the electrical interconnect wiring with point-to-point optical links may not provide sufficient power savings to make this approach attractive to chip designers. However, if high-bandwidth optical signals can be switched and routed using an on-chip silicon nanophotonic interconnection network, significant performance gains can be expected. Here we show an ultracompact (40&#160;&#215;&#160;12&#160;&#181;m<sup>2</sup>) wavelength-insensitive switch based on cascaded silicon microring resonators, which may bring this vision closer to reality by serving as a critical basic element for scalable on-chip optical networks.

letter,Colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting diodes with metal-oxide charge transport layers,"<p>Colloidal quantum dots, with their tunable luminescence properties, are uniquely suited for use as lumophores in light-emitting devices for display technologies and large-area planar lighting. In contrast to epitaxially grown quantum dots, colloidal quantum dots can be synthesized as highly monodisperse colloids and solution deposited over large areas into densely packed, solid-state multilayers, which have shown promise as efficient optical gain media. To be a viable platform for colour-tunable electrically pumped lasers, the present-generation quantum-dot LEDs must be modified to withstand the extended, high-current-density operation needed to achieve population inversion. This requirement necessitates a quantum-dot LED design that incorporates robust charge transport layers. Here we report the use of sputtered, amorphous inorganic semiconductors as robust charge transport layers and demonstrate devices capable of operating at current densities exceeding 3.5&#160;A&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> with peak brightness of 1,950&#160;Cd&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and maximum external electroluminescence efficiency of nearly 0.1%, which represents a 100-fold improvement over previously reported structures.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""J.
