letter,Experimental demonstration of frequency-agile terahertz metamaterials,"<p>Metamaterials exhibit numerous novel effects and operate over a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Metamaterial devices based on these effects include gradient-index lenses, modulators for terahertz radiation and compact waveguides. The resonant nature of metamaterials results in frequency dispersion and narrow bandwidth operation where the centre frequency is fixed by the geometry and dimensions of the elements comprising the metamaterial composite. The creation of frequency-agile metamaterials would extend the spectral range over which devices function and, further, enable the manufacture of new devices such as dynamically tunable notch filters. Here, we demonstrate such frequency-agile metamaterials operating in the far-infrared by incorporating semiconductors in critical regions of metallic split-ring resonators. For this first-generation device, external optical control results in tuning of the metamaterial resonance frequency by &#8764;20%. Our approach is integrable with current semiconductor technologies and can be implemented in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Materials Physics & Applications Division, Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, 87545, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hou-Tong Chen"", "",\u00a0John F.

letter,Omnidirectional absorption in nanostructured metal surfaces,"<p>Light absorbers available at present provide far from optimal black-body performance. The need for more efficient absorbers is particularly acute on the microscale, where they can play a significant role in preventing crosstalk between optical interconnects, and also as thermal light-emitting sources. Several efforts have been made in this context to achieve near-total but directionally dependent absorption using periodic grating structures. However, the ability to absorb light completely for any incident direction of light remains a challenge. Here we show that total omnidirectional absorption of light can be achieved in nanostructured metal surfaces that sustain localized optical excitations. The effect is realized over a full range of incident angles and can be tuned throughout the visible and near-infrared regimes by scaling the nanostructure dimensions. We suggest that surfaces displaying omnidirectional absorption will play a key role in devising efficient photovoltaic cells in which the absorbed light leads to electron&#8211;hole pair production.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Instituto de \u00d3ptica \u2013 CSIC, Serrano 121, Madrid, 28006, Spain"", ""authors"": [""T.

letter,Superconducting nanowire photon-number-resolving detector at telecommunication wavelengths,"<p>Optical-to-electrical conversion, which is the basis of the operation of optical detectors, can be linear or nonlinear. When high sensitivities are needed, single-photon detectors are used, which operate in a strongly nonlinear mode, their response being independent of the number of detected photons. However, photon-number-resolving detectors are needed, particularly in quantum optics, where n-photon states are routinely produced. In quantum communication and quantum information processing, the photon-number-resolving functionality is key to many protocols, such as the implementation of quantum repeaters and linear-optics quantum computing. A linear detector with single-photon sensitivity can also be used for measuring a temporal waveform at extremely low light levels, such as in long-distance optical communications, fluorescence spectroscopy and optical time-domain reflectometry. We demonstrate here a photon-number-resolving detector based on parallel superconducting nanowires and capable of counting up to four photons at telecommunication wavelengths, with an ultralow dark count rate and high counting frequency.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Moscow State Pedagogical University (MSPU), Moscow, 119992, Russian Federation"", ""authors"": [""Aleksander Divochiy"", "",\u00a0Alexander Korneev"", "",\u00a0Vitaliy Seleznev"", "",\u00a0Nataliya Kaurova"", "",\u00a0Olga Minaeva"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gregory Gol'tsman""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Photonics and Quantum Electronics (IPEQ), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Station 3, Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Francesco Marsili"", "",\u00a0David Bitauld"", "",\u00a0Konstantinos G.

letter,Tuning the scattering response of optical nanoantennas with nanocircuit loads,"<p>Optical nanodipoles made of plasmonic elongated nanoparticles have been theoretically and experimentally characterized by various groups in recent studies. However, compared with their radiofrequency counterparts, less attention has so far been paid to systematic design methodology for these nanoantennas, and in particular to the possibility of optimizing their radiation and scattering properties and tuning their frequency response by using proper &#8216;loading&#8217; techniques. By interpreting nanoparticles' interaction with light as lumped nanocircuit elements, we show how the concepts of antenna loading may be fully introduced in plasmonic nanoantenna design. In particular, we show how nanocircuit elements, and in general more complex nanofilters, designed within the framework of nanocircuit theory and used as nanoloads, may allow tuning of the frequency response of scattering from these nanoantennas at will. Series and parallel combinations of these nanoloads are also considered to add further degrees of freedom in the design.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, 200 South 33rd Street \u2013 ESE 203 Moore, Philadelphia, 19104, Pennsylvania, USA"", ""authors"": [""Andrea Al\u00f9"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Nader Engheta""]}]",False,"[""Andrea Al\u00f9"", ""Nader Engheta""]","Alù, A., Engheta, N.

letter,Nanoscale optical microscopy in the vectorial focusing regime,"<p>It has been known since 1959 that the focal-plane intensity distribution produced by focusing polarized light with a high-numerical-aperture lens should be highly asymmetric. Remarkably, the consequences of this fundamental effect in direct image acquisition have remained unexploited, although vectorial effects have been observed in the contexts of free-space focusing, molecular fluorescence and photolithography. By using extreme-numerical-aperture (values of 3.5), solid-immersion microscopy we have obtained images of a silicon integrated circuit showing, for the first time, the dramatic influence of polarization on their spatial resolution, with values from 100&#160;nm to 250&#160;nm. Our data show that polarization-sensitive imaging can substantially surpass the scalar diffraction limit embodied by classical formulae such as Sparrow's criterion. Such performance will have an impact on activities such as integrated-circuit failure analysis, where optical inspection faces serious challenges from the sub-100-nm feature sizes routinely used in production devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ultrafast Optics Group, School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Riccarton, Edinburgh, EH14 4AS, UK"", ""authors"": [""K.
