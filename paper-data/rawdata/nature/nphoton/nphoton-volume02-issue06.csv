letter,Lasing spaser,"<p>In 2003 Bergman and Stockman introduced the spaser, a quantum amplifier of surface plasmons by stimulated emission of radiation. They argued that by exploiting a metal/dielectric composite medium it should be possible to construct a nanodevice, where a strong coherent field is built up in a spatial region much smaller than the wavelength. V-shaped metallic structures, combined with semiconductor quantum dots, were discussed as a possible realization of the spaser. Here we introduce a further development of the spaser concept. We show that by combining the metamaterial and spaser ideas one can create a narrow-diversion coherent source of electromagnetic radiation that is fuelled by plasmonic oscillations. We argue that a two-dimensional array of a certain class of plasmonic resonators supporting coherent current excitations with high quality factor can act as a planar source of spatially and temporally coherent radiation, which we term a &#8216;lasing spaser.&#8217;</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK"", ""authors"": [""N.

letter,Optical frequency comb with submillihertz linewidth and more than 10 W average power,"<p>Growing demands for high average and peak powers in extreme nonlinear optics, attosecond-pulse and extreme ultraviolet comb generation experiments can find a powerful solution in fibre-based mode-locked lasers. Using passive enhancement cavities, fibre lasers have produced high-repetition-rate femtosecond pulse trains with multikilowatt average powers and peak powers reaching hundreds of megawatts. One major challenge for novel high-resolution spectroscopy and precision measurement in suboptical wavelength regions is to transfer the state-of-the-art optical phase coherence into the extreme ultraviolet domain through the extreme nonlinear optics enabled by these high-power systems. We demonstrate here that optical frequency combs produced by high-power fibre lasers reach unprecedented levels of performance in both precision and average power. We achieve a record low relative linewidth of &lt;1&#160;mHz between a traditional Ti:sapphire frequency comb and a novel 10&#160;W average power fibre comb, at the same time demonstrating all the necessary elements for power scaling precision comb technology to beyond 10&#160;kW.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, JILA, National Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Colorado, University of Colorado, Boulder, 80309-0440, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""T.

letter,Grating formation by metal-nanoparticle-mediated coupling of light into waveguided modes,"<p>The trapping, manipulation and conversion of light by nanostructures are of great interest at present, both scientifically and for applications. An important part of this is the interaction of light with optical waveguides, mediated by plasmon-active metal-nanoparticle arrangements. Strong coupling of incident light to waveguide-plasmon polaritons has been demonstrated by means of nanoparticle lattices, as well as by disordered metal-island film distributions, and it has further been used to enhance the efficiency of solar cells and LED (ref.&#160;). Here, we show that a disordered metal-nanoparticle layer, supported by a 40-nm-thick Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> membrane, enables coupling of a single laser pulse to the waveguided modes of the membrane, and that, under certain conditions, this leads to reorganization of the nanoparticle ensemble into ordered one- and two-dimensional grating patterns. Such self-patterning has not been observed before, and could lead to useful methods for the fabrication of complex nanostructures and advanced photonic devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, SE-412 96, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""L.

article,Nanometric optical tweezers based on nanostructured substrates,"<p>The ability to control the position of a mesoscopic object with nanometric precision is important for the rapid progress of nanoscience. One of the most promising tools to achieve such control is optical tweezers, which trap objects near the focus of a laser beam. However, the drawbacks of conventional tweezers include a trapping volume that is diffraction-limited and significant brownian motion of trapped nanoobjects. Here, we report the first experimental realization of three-dimensional nanometric optical tweezers that are based on nanostructured substrates. Using electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold nanodots in a standard optical tweezers set-up, we create an array of subwavelength plasmonic optical traps that offer a significant increase in trapping efficiency. The nanodot optical near-fields reduce the trapping volume beyond the diffraction limit and quench brownian motion of the trapped nanoparticles by almost an order of magnitude as compared to conventional tweezers operating under the same trapping conditions. Our tweezers achieve nanoscale control of entities at significantly smaller laser powers and open new avenues for nanomanipulation of fragile biological objects.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK"", ""authors"": [""A.

article,Incoherent spatial solitons in effectively instantaneous nonlinear media,"<p>Incoherent optical spatial solitons are self-trapped beams with a multimodal structure that varies randomly in time. They form when their diffraction-broadening, which is governed by their spatial correlations, is balanced by nonlinear interaction between the waves and the medium, resulting in the stationary propagation of the time-averaged intensity structure of the beam. The experimental observation of incoherent solitons has opened up exciting new avenues in soliton science. However, all incoherent spatial solitons observed to date have been supported by nonlinearities with a slow response time, &#964;, that is much longer than the characteristic fluctuation time of the beam, t<sub>c</sub> &#8810; &#964;. Here, we demonstrate incoherent solitons in effectively instantaneous nonlocal nonlinear media where &#964; &#8810; t<sub>c</sub>. These solitons exhibit fundamentally new features (for example, propagation at random trajectories), and can be created in various optically nonlinear media, as well as in other fields where the nonlinearity is nonlocal and very fast.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physics Department and Solid State Institute, Technion, 32000, Haifa, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Carmel Rotschild"", "",\u00a0Tal Schwartz"", "",\u00a0Oren Cohen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mordechai Segev""]}, {""address"": ""JILA and Department of Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder, Colorado, 80309-0440, USA"", ""authors"": [""Oren Cohen""]}]",False,"[""Carmel Rotschild"", ""Tal Schwartz"", ""Oren Cohen"", ""Mordechai Segev""]","Rotschild, C., Schwartz, T., Cohen, O. et al.
