letter,Ultrafast single-shot diffraction imaging of nanoscale dynamics,"<p>The transient nanoscale dynamics of materials on femtosecond to picosecond timescales is of great interest in the study of condensed phase dynamics such as crack formation, phase separation and nucleation, and rapid fluctuations in the liquid state or in biologically relevant environments. The ability to take images in a single shot is the key to studying non-repetitive behaviour mechanisms, a capability that is of great importance in many of these problems. Using coherent diffraction imaging with femtosecond X-ray free-electron-laser pulses we capture time-series snapshots of a solid as it evolves on the ultrafast timescale. Artificial structures imprinted on a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> window are excited with an optical laser and undergo laser ablation, which is imaged with a spatial resolution of 50&#160;nm and a temporal resolution of 10&#160;ps. By using the shortest available free-electron-laser wavelengths and proven synchronization methods this technique could be extended to spatial resolutions of a few nanometres and temporal resolutions of a few tens of femtoseconds. This experiment opens the door to a new regime of time-resolved experiments in mesoscopic dynamics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Avenue, Livermore, 94550, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Anton Barty"", "",\u00a0Michael J.

letter,Blood-vessel closure using photosensitizers engineered for two-photon excitation,"<p>The spatial control of optical absorption provided by two-photon excitation has led to tremendous advances in microscopy and microfabrication. Medical applications of two-photon excitation in photodynamic therapy have been widely suggested, but thus far have been rendered impractical by the low two-photon cross-sections of photosensitizer drugs (which are compounds taken up by living tissues that become toxic on absorption of light). The invention of efficient two-photon activated drugs will allow precise three-dimensional manipulation of treatment volumes, providing a level of targeting unattainable with current therapeutic techniques. Here we present a new family of photodynamic therapy drugs designed for efficient two-photon excitation and use one of them to demonstrate selective closure of blood vessels through two-photon excitation photodynamic therapy in vivo. These conjugated porphyrin dimers have two-photon cross-sections that are more than two orders of magnitude greater than those of standard clinical photosensitizers. This is the first demonstration of in vivo photodynamic therapy using a photosensitizer engineered for efficient two-photon excitation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, Oxford University, Chemistry Research Laboratory, 12 Mansfield Road, Oxford, OX1 3TA, UK"", ""authors"": [""Hazel A.

letter,An avalanche‐photodiode-based photon-number-resolving detector,"<p>Avalanche photodiodes are widely used as practical detectors of single photons. Although conventional devices respond to one or more photons, they cannot resolve the number of photons in the incident pulse or in a short time interval. However, photon-number-resolving detectors are urgently needed for applications in quantum computing, communications and interferometry, as well as for extending the applicability of quantum detection generally. Here we show that, contrary to current belief, avalanche photodiodes are capable of detecting photon number, using a technique to measure very weak avalanches at the early stage of their development. Under such conditions the output signal from the avalanche photodiode is proportional to the number of photons in the incident pulse. As a compact, mass-manufactured device, operating without cryogens and at telecom wavelengths, it offers a practical solution for photon number detection.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Toshiba Research Europe Ltd, 208 Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, CB4 0GZ, UK"", ""authors"": [""B.

letter,Resonance-driven random lasing,"<p>A random laser is a system formed by a random assembly of elastic scatterers dispersed into an optical gain medium. The multiple light scattering replaces the standard optical cavity of traditional lasers and the interplay between gain and scattering determines the lasing properties. All random lasers studied to date have consisted of irregularly shaped or polydisperse scatterers, with a certain average scattering strength that was constant over the frequency window of the laser. In this letter we consider the case where the scattering is resonant. We demonstrate that randomly assembled monodisperse spheres can sustain scattering resonances over the gain frequency window, and that the lasing wavelength can therefore be controlled by means of the diameter and refractive index of the spheres. The system is therefore a random laser with an a priori designed lasing peak within the gain curve.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""European Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy and INFM-BEC, via Nello Carrara 1, Sesto Fiorentino (Florence), I-50019, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Stefano Gottardo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Diederik S.

article,Subwavelength colour imaging with a metallic nanolens,"<p>Early research into metamaterials by other scientists has shown that nanostructured metamaterials can focus incident light and act as a lens. Although such structures are capable of subwavelength imaging, they have two major restrictions: they can only work at one particular wavelength, and the image can only be transferred for a short distance within the limits of the near field and is therefore undetectable in the far field. Here, we propose a lens made of stacked silver nanorods that is capable of colour imaging at subwavelength resolution in the visible range. The subwavelength image can be transferred over distances of at least micrometre scale and magnified before detection by conventional optics devices. Such a nanorod lens has the potential to be an indispensable imaging tool, with particular application to biomedical applications, where individual viruses and other nano-entities could be imaged in colour in the far field.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Satoshi Kawata"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Prabhat Verma""]}, {""address"": ""Nanophotonics Laboratory, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Satoshi Kawata"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Atsushi Ono""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Prabhat Verma""]}]",False,"[""Satoshi Kawata"", ""Atsushi Ono"", ""Prabhat Verma""]","Kawata, S., Ono, A. & Verma, P.
