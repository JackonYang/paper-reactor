review article,Slow light in photonic crystals,"<p>Slow light with a remarkably low group velocity is a promising solution for buffering and time-domain processing of optical signals. It also offers the possibility for spatial compression of optical energy and the enhancement of linear and nonlinear optical effects. Photonic-crystal devices are especially attractive for generating slow light, as they are compatible with on-chip integration and room-temperature operation, and can offer wide-bandwidth and dispersion-free propagation. Here the background theory, recent experimental demonstrations and progress towards tunable slow-light structures based on photonic-band engineering are reviewed. Practical issues related to real devices and their applications are also discussed.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, 79-5 Tokiwadai, Hodogaya-ku, 240-8501, Yokohama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Toshihiko Baba""]}, {""address"": ""CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 5 Sanban-cho, Chiyoda-ku, 102-0075, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Toshihiko Baba""]}]",False,"[""Toshihiko Baba""]","Baba, T.

letter,Enhanced light out-coupling of organic light-emitting devices using embedded low-index grids,"<p>The application of organic light-emitting devices to reduce the energy consumption of interior lighting, which now costs more than $230 billion annually, is attracting interest due to the high efficiency of these devices. Indeed, electrophosphorescent organic light-emitting devices with an internal quantum efficiency &#951;<sub>IQE</sub> of 100% (refs&#160;) already approach the efficiency of fluorescent lamps. However, because of the high refractive index of organic materials and the optical confinement and internal reflection that results, the light out-coupling efficiency &#951;<sub>out</sub> for conventional organic light-emitting devices is limited to &#8764;20% (refs). Here we demonstrate that embedding a low-index grid in the organic layers can enhance the out-coupling of the waveguided light without spectral distortion. When combined with microlenses that out-couple the glass modes, the external quantum efficiency &#951;<sub>EQE</sub> and power efficiency of a white organic light-emitting device are improved to 34&#160;&#177;&#160;2% and 68&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;lm&#160;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup>. The resulting &#951;<sub>out</sub> is 2.3&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2 times that of a conventional organic light-emitting device used as a comparison, and simulations indicate that the enhancement can be further increased to 3.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, New Jersey, Princeton, 08544, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yiru Sun""]}, {""address"": ""Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Physics, and Materials Science and Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, Michigan, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yiru Sun"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Stephen R.

letter,Robust photonic entanglement distribution by state-independent encoding onto decoherence-free subspace,"<p>Efficient and faithful implementation of quantum information tasks, such as quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum metrology, requires robust and state-independent decoherence-suppressing measures to protect the quantum information carriers. Here we present an experimental demonstration of a robust distribution scheme in which one photon of an entangled photon pair is successfully encoded into and decoded from a decoherence-free subspace by a state-independent scheme. We achieved a high-fidelity distribution of the entangled state over a fibre communication channel, and also demonstrated that the scheme is robust against fragility of the reference frame. The scheme, thanks to its state-independence, is also applicable to the multipartite case where the photon to be distributed is entangled with many other photons. Such a robust and universal scheme for distributing quantum information in an indeterministic but conclusive manner will constitute an important building block of quantum communication and computing networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Engineering Science, Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, 560-8531, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takashi Yamamoto"", "",\u00a0Kodai Hayashi"", "",\u00a0\u015eahin Kaya \u00d6zdemir"", "",\u00a0Masato Koashi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Nobuyuki Imoto""]}, {""address"": ""CREST Research Team for Photonic Quantum Information, 4-1-8 Honmachi, Kawaguchi, 331-0012, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takashi Yamamoto"", "",\u00a0Kodai Hayashi"", "",\u00a0\u015eahin Kaya \u00d6zdemir"", "",\u00a0Masato Koashi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Nobuyuki Imoto""]}, {""address"": ""ERATO Nuclear Spin Electronics Project, Aramaki Aza Aoba, Sendai, 980-0845, Miyagi, Japan"", ""authors"": [""\u015eahin Kaya \u00d6zdemir""]}]",False,"[""Takashi Yamamoto"", ""Kodai Hayashi"", ""\u015eahin Kaya \u00d6zdemir"", ""Masato Koashi"", ""Nobuyuki Imoto""]","Yamamoto, T., Hayashi, K., Özdemir, Ş. et al.

letter,A high-efficiency display based on a telescopic pixel design,"<p>Several transmissive display technologies have been invented as an alternative to the liquid crystal display, which typically transmits only 5&#8211;10% of the backlight. Most are based on microelectromechanical shutters that block light or let it pass through transparent windows in an opaque substrate; however, their overall backlight transmission efficiency is still less than 10%. Here, we propose a new pixel-based technology that involves a telescopic pixel design and can transmit 36% of the backlight. Each pixel consists of two micromirrors, one of which is stationary, whereas the other can be deformed by application of an electrostatic force. Depending on the applied voltage, the deformable mirror can either stop light or focus it on the stationary mirror and let it pass through the pixel. This display technology offers a fast response time (less than 1.5&#160;ms), high image resolution, can be made from relatively cheap materials, and is compatible with liquid crystal display production processes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, 98052, Washington, USA"", ""authors"": [""Anna L.

letter,A hybrid plasmonic waveguide for subwavelength confinement and long-range propagation,"<p>The emerging field of nanophotonics addresses the critical challenge of manipulating light on scales much smaller than the wavelength. However, very few feasible practical approaches exist at present. Surface plasmon polaritons are among the most promising candidates for subwavelength optical confinement. However, studies of long-range surface plasmon polaritons have only demonstrated optical confinement comparable to that of conventional dielectric waveguides, because of practical issues including optical losses and stringent fabrication demands. Here, we propose a new approach that integrates dielectric waveguiding with plasmonics. The hybrid optical waveguide consists of a dielectric nanowire separated from a metal surface by a nanoscale dielectric gap. The coupling between the plasmonic and waveguide modes across the gap enables &#8216;capacitor-like&#8217; energy storage that allows effective subwavelength transmission in non-metallic regions. In this way, surface plasmon polaritons can travel over large distances (40&#8211;150&#160;&#181;m) with strong mode confinement (ranging from &#955;<sup>2</sup>/400 to &#955;<sup>2</sup>/40). This approach is fully compatible with semiconductor fabrication techniques and could lead to truly nanoscale semiconductor-based plasmonics and photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, 3112 Etcheverry Hall, University of California, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""R.

article,Creation of a needle of longitudinally polarized light in vacuum using binary optics,"<p>Recently many ideas have been proposed for the use of a longitudinal field for particle acceleration, fluorescent imaging, second-harmonic generation and Raman spectroscopy. A few methods to enhance the longitudinal field component have been suggested, but all have insufficient optical efficiency and non-uniform axial field strength. Here we report a new method that permits the combination of very unusual properties of light in the focal region, permitting the creation of a &#8216;pure&#8217; longitudinal light beam with subdiffraction beam size (0.43&#955;). This beam is non-diffracting; that is, it propagates without divergence over a long distance (of about 4&#955;) in free space. This is achieved by focusing a radially polarized Bessel&#8211;Gaussian beam with a combination of a binary-phase optical element and a high-numerical-aperture lens. This binary optics works as a special polarization filter enhancing the longitudinal component.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Data Storage Institute (DSI), Agency for Science, Technology and Research, DSI Building, 5 Engineering Drive 1, 117608, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Haifeng Wang"", "",\u00a0Luping Shi"", "",\u00a0Boris Lukyanchuk"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Chong Tow Chong""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 4 Engineering Drive 3, 117576, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Chong Tow Chong""]}, {""address"": ""Division of Bioengineering, National University of Singapore, 7 Engineering Drive 1, 117574, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Colin Sheppard""]}]",False,"[""Haifeng Wang"", ""Luping Shi"", ""Boris Lukyanchuk"", ""Colin Sheppard"", ""Chong Tow Chong""]","Wang, H., Shi, L., Lukyanchuk, B. et al.
