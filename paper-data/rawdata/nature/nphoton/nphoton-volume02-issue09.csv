letter,A 342-nm ultraviolet AlGaN multiple-quantum-well laser diode,"<p>The realization of semiconductor laser diodes and light-emitting diodes that emit short-wavelength ultraviolet light is of considerable interest for a number of applications including chemical/biochemical analysis, high-density data storage and material processing. Group III nitride materials are one of the most promising candidates for fabricating such devices. Here we describe an AlGaN multiple-quantum-well laser diode that emits light at 342&#160;nm, the shortest wavelength ever reported for an electrically driven laser diode. To fabricate the laser, a low-dislocation-density AlGaN layer with an AlN mole fraction of 0.3 was grown on a sapphire substrate using a hetero facet-controlled epitaxial lateral overgrowth (hetero-FACELO) method. An AlGaN multiple-quantum-well structure was then grown on the high-quality AlGaN layer. Lasing at a wavelength of 342.3&#160;nm was observed under pulsed current mode at room temperature.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Central Research Laboratories, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., 5000 Hirakuchi, Hamakita-ku, 434-8601, Hamamatsu, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Harumasa Yoshida"", "",\u00a0Yoji Yamashita"", "",\u00a0Masakazu Kuwabara"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hirofumi Kan""]}]",False,"[""Harumasa Yoshida"", ""Yoji Yamashita"", ""Masakazu Kuwabara"", ""Hirofumi Kan""]","Yoshida, H., Yamashita, Y., Kuwabara, M. et al.A 342-nm ultraviolet AlGaN multiple-quantum-well laser diode.

letter,A compact free-electron laser for generating coherent radiation in the extreme ultraviolet region,"<p>Single-pass free-electron lasers based on self-amplified spontaneous emission are enabling the generation of laser light at ever shorter wavelengths, including extreme ultraviolet, soft X-rays and even hard X-rays. A typical X-ray free-electron laser is a few kilometres in length and requires an electron-beam energy higher than 10&#160;GeV (refs&#160;). If such light sources are to become accessible to more researchers, a significant reduction in scale is desirable Here, we report observations of brilliant extreme-ultraviolet radiation from a 55-m-long compact self-amplified spontaneous-emission source, which combines short-period undulators with a high-quality electron source operating at a low acceleration energy of 250&#160;MeV. The radiation power reaches saturation at wavelengths ranging from 51 to 61&#160;nm with a maximum pulse energy of 30&#160;&#181;J. The ultralow emittance (0.6&#960;&#160;mm&#160;mrad) of the electron beam from a CeB<sub>6</sub> thermionic cathode is barely degraded by a multiple-stage bunch compression system that dramatically enhances the beam current from 1 to 300&#160;A. This achievement expands the potential for generating X-ray free-electron laser radiation with a compact 2-GeV machine.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""RIKEN, XFEL Project Head Office, Kouto 1-1-1, Sayo, 679-5148, Hyogo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Tsumoru Shintake"", "",\u00a0Hitoshi Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Toru Hara"", "",\u00a0Takashi Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Kazuaki Togawa"", "",\u00a0Makina Yabashi"", "",\u00a0Yuji Otake"", "",\u00a0Yoshihiro Asano"", "",\u00a0Toru Fukui"", "",\u00a0Atsushi Higashiya"", "",\u00a0Naoyasu Hosoda"", "",\u00a0Takahiro Inagaki"", "",\u00a0Shinobu Inoue"", "",\u00a0Yujong Kim"", "",\u00a0Masanobu Kitamura"", "",\u00a0Hirokazu Maesaka"", "",\u00a0Sakuo Matsui"", "",\u00a0Mitsuru Nagasono"", "",\u00a0Takashi Ohshima"", "",\u00a0Kazuyuki Onoe"", "",\u00a0Katsutoshi Shirasawa"", "",\u00a0Kenji Tamasaku"", "",\u00a0Ryotaro Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Yoshihito Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Takanori Tanikawa"", "",\u00a0Tadashi Togashi"", "",\u00a0Shukui Wu"", "",\u00a0Hideo Kitamura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tetsuya Ishikawa""]}, {""address"": ""Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, Kouto 1-1-1, Sayo, 679-5198, Hyogo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Toru Hara"", "",\u00a0Takashi Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Yoshihiro Asano"", "",\u00a0Teruhiko Bizen"", "",\u00a0Shunji Goto"", "",\u00a0Toko Hirono"", "",\u00a0Miho Ishii"", "",\u00a0Hiroaki Kimura"", "",\u00a0Toshiaki Kobayashi"", "",\u00a0Takemasa Masuda"", "",\u00a0Tomohiro Matsushita"", "",\u00a0Xavier Mar\u00e9chal"", "",\u00a0Haruhiko Ohashi"", "",\u00a0Toru Ohata"", "",\u00a0Tetsuya Takagi"", "",\u00a0Sunao Takahashi"", "",\u00a0Masao Takeuchi"", "",\u00a0Ryotaro Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Akihiro Yamashita"", "",\u00a0Kenichi Yanagida"", "",\u00a0Chao Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hideo Kitamura""]}]",False,"[""Tsumoru Shintake"", ""Hitoshi Tanaka"", ""Toru Hara"", ""Takashi Tanaka"", ""Kazuaki Togawa"", ""Makina Yabashi"", ""Yuji Otake"", ""Yoshihiro Asano"", ""Teruhiko Bizen"", ""Toru Fukui"", ""Shunji Goto"", ""Atsushi Higashiya"", ""Toko Hirono"", ""Naoyasu Hosoda"", ""Takahiro Inagaki"", ""Shinobu Inoue"", ""Miho Ishii"", ""Yujong Kim"", ""Hiroaki Kimura"", ""Masanobu Kitamura"", ""Toshiaki Kobayashi"", ""Hirokazu Maesaka"", ""Takemasa Masuda"", ""Sakuo Matsui"", ""Tomohiro Matsushita"", ""Xavier Mar\u00e9chal"", ""Mitsuru Nagasono"", ""Haruhiko Ohashi"", ""Toru Ohata"", ""Takashi Ohshima"", ""Kazuyuki Onoe"", ""Katsutoshi Shirasawa"", ""Tetsuya Takagi"", ""Sunao Takahashi"", ""Masao Takeuchi"", ""Kenji Tamasaku"", ""Ryotaro Tanaka"", ""Yoshihito Tanaka"", ""Takanori Tanikawa"", ""Tadashi Togashi"", ""Shukui Wu"", ""Akihiro Yamashita"", ""Kenichi Yanagida"", ""Chao Zhang"", ""Hideo Kitamura"", ""Tetsuya Ishikawa""]","Shintake, T., Tanaka, H., Hara, T. et al.A compact free-electron laser for generating coherent radiation in the extreme ultraviolet region.

letter,Massively parallel X-ray holography,"<p>Advances in the development of free-electron lasers offer the realistic prospect of nanoscale imaging on the timescale of atomic motions. We identify X-ray Fourier-transform holography as a promising but, so far, inefficient scheme to do this. We show that a uniformly redundant array placed next to the sample, multiplies the efficiency of X-ray Fourier transform holography by more than three orders of magnitude, approaching that of a perfect lens, and provides holographic images with both amplitude- and phase-contrast information. The experiments reported here demonstrate this concept by imaging a nano-fabricated object at a synchrotron source, and a bacterial cell with a soft-X-ray free-electron laser, where illumination by a single 15-fs pulse was successfully used in producing the holographic image.

article,Small-divergence semiconductor lasers by plasmonic collimation,"<p>Surface plasmons offer the exciting possibility of improving the functionality of optical devices through the subwavelength manipulation of light. We show that surface plasmons can be used to shape the beams of edge-emitting semiconductor lasers and greatly reduce their large intrinsic beam divergence. Using quantum cascade lasers as a model system, we show that by defining a metallic subwavelength slit and a grating on their facet, a small beam divergence in the laser polarization direction can be achieved. Divergence angles as small as 2.4&#176; are obtained, representing a reduction in beam spread by a factor of 25 compared with the original 9.9-&#181;m-wavelength laser used. Despite having a patterned facet, our collimated lasers do not suffer significant reductions in output power (&#8764;100 mW at room temperature). Plasmonic collimation provides a means of efficiently coupling the output of a variety of lasers into optical fibres and waveguides, or to collimate them for applications such as free-space communications, ranging and metrology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nanfang Yu"", "",\u00a0Jonathan Fan"", "",\u00a0Qi Jie Wang"", "",\u00a0Christian Pfl\u00fcgl"", "",\u00a0Laurent Diehl"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Federico Capasso""]}, {""address"": ""Central Research Laboratory, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K, Hamamatsu, 434-8601, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Tadataka Edamura"", "",\u00a0Masamichi Yamanishi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hirofumi Kan""]}]",False,"[""Nanfang Yu"", ""Jonathan Fan"", ""Qi Jie Wang"", ""Christian Pfl\u00fcgl"", ""Laurent Diehl"", ""Tadataka Edamura"", ""Masamichi Yamanishi"", ""Hirofumi Kan"", ""Federico Capasso""]","Yu, N., Fan, J., Wang, Q. et al.

article,Stable generation of GeV-class electron beams from self-guided laser–plasma channels,"<p>Table-top laser-driven plasma accelerators are gaining attention for their potential use in miniaturizing future high-energy accelerators. By irradiating gas jet targets with ultrashort intense laser pulses, the generation of quasimonoenergetic electron beams was recently observed. Currently, the stability of beam generation and the ability to scale to higher electron beam energies are critical issues for practical laser acceleration. Here, we demonstrate the first generation of stable GeV-class electron beams from stable few-millimetre-long plasma channels in a self-guided wakefield acceleration process. As primary evidence of the laser wakefield acceleration in a bubble regime, we observed a boost of both the electron beam energy and quality by reducing the plasma density and increasing the plasma length in a 1-cm-long gas jet. Subsequent three-dimensional simulations show the possibility of achieving even higher electron beam energies by minimizing plasma bubble elongation, and we anticipate dramatic increases in beam energy and quality in the near future. This will pave the way towards ultracompact, all-optical electron beam accelerators and their applications in science, technology and medicine.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Advanced Photonics Research Institute, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, 500-712, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Nasr A.
