progress article,Femtosecond laser oscillators for high-field science,"<p>Ultrafast laser oscillators have become ubiquitous in science and technology. For many years, however, their pulse energy has been limited to the nanojoule regime. Applications requiring more intense pulses relied on complex amplifier systems, which typically operate at low pulse repetition rates of the order of kilohertz. Recently, the pulse energy of femtosecond laser oscillators has greatly increased, such that some of these experiments can now be driven at multimegahertz repetition rates, which opens promising new avenues for many applications. We review the current state of the art of high-energy femtosecond laser oscillators, in particular mode-locked thin-disk lasers, and discuss their potential to drive high-field science experiments at multimegahertz repetition rates.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, 8093, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""T.

letter,Coherent control of terahertz supercontinuum generation in ultrafast laser–gas interactions,"<p>Frequency mixing an ultrafast-pulse laser's fundamental and second-harmonic fields in semiconductors, atomic gases, and on metal surfaces generates a directional electrical current for which the magnitude and polarity depend upon the relative phase between these two fields. As this current occurs on the timescale of the duration of the laser pulse, in the case of ultrafast lasers (&lt;100&#160;fs), this process can generate electromagnetic radiation at terahertz frequencies. Although such terahertz generation has been observed in semiconductors and air, the terahertz generation mechanism is not well understood and the terahertz yield has not been optimized. Here, we demonstrate a coherent control scheme to optimize terahertz generation in gases, yielding a new source of high-energy (&gt;5 &#181;J), super-broadband terahertz radiation (&#8764;75 THz) as well as an enhanced accompanying third harmonic. We also present a unifying explanation for such extremely broad electromagnetic radiation generation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Material Physics and Applications Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, 87545, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""K.

letter,Fast focusing using a pinned-contact oscillating liquid lens,"<p>Liquid lenses are attractive for applications in adaptive optics requiring a fast response. In conventional designs focusing time is limited by liquid inertia and the time it takes for transients in lens shape to subside. As a result, operation is confined to after the oscillations have dampened. Here we demonstrate a harmonically driven liquid lens with an oscillating focal length, which can capture any image plane in a given range by grabbing the image &#8216;in sync&#8217; with the oscillations. By oscillating the lens, the task of changing the focal length is effectively transformed from a mechanical manipulation to the electronic timing of image capture, which can be achieved much more quickly. High-fidelity imaging is demonstrated at 100&#160;Hz for a millimetre-scale liquid lens, which is driven at resonance and features pinned contact lines. Theoretical predictions show that a significantly faster response is possible with scaled-down lenses.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, 12180, USA"", ""authors"": [""Carlos A.

letter,Absolute extinction cross-section of individual magnetic split-ring resonators,"<p>Complete control of an electromagnetic wave requires access to its electric and magnetic vector components. Realizing this level of control with metamaterials has recently opened new avenues regarding negative refractive indices and invisibility cloaking. The required microscopic building blocks are artificial electric and magnetic dipoles. Magnetic dipoles oscillating at optical frequencies have become available only recently in the form of man-made split-ring resonators, essentially subwavelength resonant electromagnets. Previous experimental work has focused on arrays of electric and/or magnetic dipoles. For further developments in this field, knowledge of the properties of the individual dipoles is highly desirable. In this paper, using a modulation technique, we measure the absolute extinction cross-section of a single split-ring resonator for the first time. At the fundamental magnetic resonance, it is found to be about one-seventh of &#955;<sup>2</sup> at a wavelength of &#955;&#160;=&#160;1.4&#160;&#181;m, which is in excellent agreement with microscopic calculations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Physik, Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe (TH), Wolfgang-Gaede-Stra\u00dfe 1, Karlsruhe, D-76131, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Martin Husnik"", "",\u00a0Matthias W.

letter,An on-chip near-field terahertz probe and detector,"<p>The advantageous properties of terahertz waves, such as their transmission through objects opaque to visible light, are attracting attention for imaging applications. A promising approach for achieving high spatial resolution is the use of near-field imaging. Although this method has been well established in the visible and microwave regions, it is challenging to perform in the terahertz region. In the terahertz techniques investigated to date, detectors have been located remotely from the probe, which degrades sensitivity, and the influence of far-field waves is unavoidable. Here we present a new integrated detection device for terahertz near-field imaging in which all the necessary detection components&#8212;an aperture, a probe and a terahertz detector&#8212;are integrated on one semiconductor chip, which is cryogenically cooled. This scheme allows highly sensitive, high-resolution detection of the evanescent field alone and promises new capabilities for high-resolution terahertz imaging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Advanced Device Laboratory, RIKEN, 2-1, Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yukio Kawano"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Koji Ishibashi""]}, {""address"": ""PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yukio Kawano""]}]",False,"[""Yukio Kawano"", ""Koji Ishibashi""]","Kawano, Y., Ishibashi, K.

article,A wavelength-selective photonic-crystal waveguide coupled to a nanowire light source,"<p>The efficient delivery of photons from light sources to photonic circuits is central to any fibre-optic or integrated optical system. Coupling light emitters to optical fibres or waveguides determines the photon flux available in, and therefore the performance of, photonic devices used in applications such as optical communication and information processing. Many solutions have been proposed to improve impedance matching in light-emitting diode-to-fibre or photonic-crystal cavity-to-waveguide systems; however, the efficient coupling of integrated light sources into nanophotonic circuits remains a challenge. Here, we propose an optically or electrically driven photonic structure that uses active semiconductor nanowires to light up photonic-crystal waveguides. The photonic crystal is used to either guide or filter out different colours of light as desired. In addition, we report an active nanowire-based optical structure that can generate two different colours of light and then send them in opposite directions. The hybrid nanowire/photonic-crystal waveguide represents a significant advance towards all-optical processing in nanoscale integrated photonic circuits and a new addition to the nanophotonic toolbox.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hong-Gyu Park"", "",\u00a0Carl J.

article,Ultralow-dissipation optomechanical resonators on a chip,"<p>Cavity-enhanced radiation-pressure coupling of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom gives rise to a range of optomechanical phenomena, in particular providing a route to the quantum regime of mesoscopic mechanical oscillators. A prime challenge in cavity optomechanics has been to realize systems that simultaneously maximize optical finesse and mechanical quality. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, independent control over both mechanical and optical degrees of freedom within the same on-chip resonator. The first direct observation of mechanical normal mode coupling in a micromechanical system allows for a quantitative understanding of mechanical dissipation. Subsequent optimization of the resonator geometry enables intrinsic material loss limited mechanical Q-factors, rivalling the best values reported in the high megahertz frequency range, while simultaneously preserving the resonators' ultrahigh optical finesse. As well as providing a complete understanding of mechanical dissipation in microresonator-based optomechanical systems, our results provide a promising setting for cavity optomechanics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Hans-Kopfermann-Str.1, Garching, 85748, Germany"", ""authors"": [""G.
