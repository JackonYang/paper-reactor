letter,Optically mediated particle clearing using Airy wavepackets,"<p>The Airy wavepacket solution for a free particle exhibits propagation invariance and, surprisingly, acceleration transverse to the propagation direction. Discovered as a solution of the free-particle Schr&#246;dinger equation, Airy wavepackets have been predicted, and in a recent major step forward, realized in the optical domain, but have never been used in any application. In this Letter we demonstrate the first use of the Airy light beam in optical micromanipulation. Based on the characteristic intensity pattern, the beam drags particles into the main intensity maximum, which guides particles vertically along a parabolic trajectory. This unusual property of Airy beams leads to a new feature in optical micromanipulation&#8212;the removal of particles and cells from a section of a sample chamber. We term this highly robust and efficient process &#8216;optically mediated particle clearing&#8217;, which enables novel microfluidic applications within the colloidal and biological sciences.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, KY16 9SS, UK"", ""authors"": [""J\u00f6rg Baumgartl"", "",\u00a0Michael Mazilu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kishan Dholakia""]}]",False,"[""J\u00f6rg Baumgartl"", ""Michael Mazilu"", ""Kishan Dholakia""]","Baumgartl, J., Mazilu, M. & Dholakia, K.

letter,A chirped photonic-crystal fibre,"<p>Photonic crystals have widely increased the facility to guide and confine light at wavelengths close to the optical wavelength. Because they can include extremely sharp bends, photonic-crystal waveguides are a key element in future integrated optical devices. Moreover, they enable the manipulation of the spontaneous emission properties of luminescent devices, the localization of light in microcavities, and they may serve to generate negative refraction. A special class of these devices are the hollow-core photonic-crystal fibres, which confine the light by means of a periodic cladding, consisting of several layers of identical cells. This design resonantly decreases the transmission losses of such fibres to values of a few dB&#160;km<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in a narrow wavelength range. However, the rather narrowband transmission bands and the detrimental third-order dispersion characteristics of this single-cell design generally render application of such hollow-core fibres difficult in the femtosecond range. Therefore, no fibre-based concept can currently provide guiding of sub-100&#160;fs pulses over extended distances. By introducing a radial chirp into the photonic crystal, we here demonstrate a novel concept for photonic-crystal fibres that breaks with the paradigm of lattice homogeneity and enables a new degree of freedom in photonic-crystal-fibre design, eliminating much of the pulse duration restriction of earlier approaches.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Saratov State University, Astrakhanskaya 83, Saratov, 410026, Russia"", ""authors"": [""Julia S.

letter,Organic plasmon-emitting diode,"<p>Surface plasmons are hybrid modes of longitudinal electron oscillations and light fields at the interface of a metal and a dielectric. Driven by advances in nanofabrication, imaging and numerical methods, a wide range of plasmonic elements such as waveguides, Bragg mirrors, beamsplitters, optical modulators and surface plasmon detectors have recently been reported. For introducing dynamic functionality to plasmonics, the rapidly growing field of organic optoelectronics holds strong promise due to its ease of fabrication and integration opportunities. Here, we introduce an electrically switchable surface plasmon source based on an organic light&#8208;emitting diode. The source provides a freely propagating surface plasmon beam and is potentially useful for organic integrated photonic circuits and sensing applications. Furthermore, the demonstration of controlled coupling of surface plasmons and excitons in organic materials could prove useful for the fabrication of improved organic light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Physics, Karl-Franzens-University, Graz, A-8010, Austria"", ""authors"": [""D.M.

article,Coupling of quantum-dot light emission with a three-dimensional photonic-crystal nanocavity,"<p>We report on the first demonstration of the coupling of fully confined electrons and photons using a combination of three-dimensional photonic crystal nanocavities and quantum dots. The three dimensional photonic crystals were assembled by stacking planar components using a sophisticated micromanipulation technique. Point defects, containing embedded quantum dots, were introduced into the photonic crystals as active sites. By measuring the photoluminescence spectra of the assembly, the process by which light emitted from the quantum dots is coupled to the defect modes of a three dimensional photonic crystal was demonstrated for the first time. The characteristics of the sharp emission peaks agreed well with numerical simulations, and these were confirmed to be resonant modes by polarization measurements. The highest quality factor (Q-factor) for three dimensional photonic crystals (2,300) was achieved.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro, 153-8505, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kanna Aoki"", "",\u00a0Denis Guimard"", "",\u00a0Masao Nishioka"", "",\u00a0Masahiro Nomura"", "",\u00a0Satoshi Iwamoto"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yasuhiko Arakawa""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Nano Quantum Information Electronics, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro, 153-8505, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kanna Aoki"", "",\u00a0Denis Guimard"", "",\u00a0Masahiro Nomura"", "",\u00a0Satoshi Iwamoto"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yasuhiko Arakawa""]}, {""address"": ""Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro, 153-8904, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Satoshi Iwamoto"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yasuhiko Arakawa""]}]",False,"[""Kanna Aoki"", ""Denis Guimard"", ""Masao Nishioka"", ""Masahiro Nomura"", ""Satoshi Iwamoto"", ""Yasuhiko Arakawa""]","Aoki, K., Guimard, D., Nishioka, M. et al.
