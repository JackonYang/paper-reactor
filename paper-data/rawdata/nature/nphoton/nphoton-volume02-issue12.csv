letter,Fast physical random bit generation with chaotic semiconductor lasers,"<p>Random number generators in digital information systems make use of physical entropy sources such as electronic and photonic noise to add unpredictability to deterministically generated pseudo-random sequences. However, there is a large gap between the generation rates achieved with existing physical sources and the high data rates of many computation and communication systems; this is a fundamental weakness of these systems. Here we show that good quality random bit sequences can be generated at very fast bit rates using physical chaos in semiconductor lasers. Streams of bits that pass standard statistical tests for randomness have been generated at rates of up to 1.7&#160;Gbps by sampling the fluctuating optical output of two chaotic lasers. This rate is an order of magnitude faster than that of previously reported devices for physical random bit generators with verified randomness. This means that the performance of random number generators can be greatly improved by using chaotic laser devices as physical entropy sources.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electronics and Computer Systems, Takushoku University, 815-1 Tatemachi, Hachioji, 193-0985, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Atsushi Uchida"", "",\u00a0Kazuya Amano"", "",\u00a0Masaki Inoue"", "",\u00a0Kunihito Hirano"", "",\u00a0Sunao Naito"", "",\u00a0Hiroyuki Someya"", "",\u00a0Isao Oowada"", "",\u00a0Takayuki Kurashige"", "",\u00a0Masaru Shiki"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shigeru Yoshimori""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Information and Computer Sciences, Saitama University, 255 Shimo-Okubo, Sakura-ku, Saitama city, 338-8570, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Atsushi Uchida""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 2-4 Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, 619-0237, Kyoto, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuyuki Yoshimura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Peter Davis""]}]",False,"[""Atsushi Uchida"", ""Kazuya Amano"", ""Masaki Inoue"", ""Kunihito Hirano"", ""Sunao Naito"", ""Hiroyuki Someya"", ""Isao Oowada"", ""Takayuki Kurashige"", ""Masaru Shiki"", ""Shigeru Yoshimori"", ""Kazuyuki Yoshimura"", ""Peter Davis""]","Uchida, A., Amano, K., Inoue, M. et al.

letter,Drift-free femtosecond timing synchronization of remote optical and microwave sources,"<p>Femtosecond mode-locked lasers have revolutionized many fields of science and engineering. Because of their ultralow noise, it has been anticipated that mode-locked lasers would synchronize large-scale scientific facilities requiring extremely high timing accuracy. However, the lack of long-term stable synchronization techniques has hindered the realization of pervasive synchronization with such lasers. Here we present a comprehensive set of new techniques for long-term stable synchronization of optical and microwave sources over long distances. We use ultralow-noise optical pulse trains generated from mode-locked lasers as the timing signals, then distribute them by means of timing-stabilized fibre links and, finally, synchronize the delivered timing signals with the optical and microwave sources being targeted. Using these techniques, we demonstrate, for the first time, that remotely located lasers and microwave sources can be synchronized with less than 10-fs precision over more than 10&#160;h. This drift-free operation is an important milestone in transitioning mode-locked laser-based synchronization from the laboratory into real-world facilities.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jungwon Kim"", "",\u00a0Jonathan A.

letter,Low-power continuous-wave nonlinear optics in doped silica glass integrated waveguide structures,"<p>Photonic integrated circuits are a key component of future telecommunication networks, where demands for greater bandwidth, network flexibility, and low energy consumption and cost must all be met. The quest for all-optical components has naturally targeted materials with extremely large nonlinearity, including chalcogenide glasses and semiconductors, such as silicon and AlGaAs (ref.&#160;). However, issues such as immature fabrication technology for chalcogenide glass and high linear and nonlinear losses for semiconductors motivate the search for other materials. Here we present the first demonstration of nonlinear optics in integrated silica-based glass waveguides using continuous-wave light. We demonstrate four-wave mixing, with low (5&#160;mW) continuous-wave pump power at &#955;&#160;=&#160;1,550&#160;nm, in high-index, doped silica glass ring resonators. The low loss, design flexibility and manufacturability of our device are important attributes for low-cost, high-performance, nonlinear all-optical photonic integrated circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""INRS-EMT, Varennes, J3X 1S2, 1650 Boulevard Lionel Boulet, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Large-scale arrays of ultrahigh-Q coupled nanocavities,"<p>Coupled microresonators are expected to play a key role in slow-light engineering and various types of light-matter interaction enhancement, especially if they are based on small and high-Q cavities. Although rapid progress has been made on microresonator performance, large-scale arrays of coupled resonators based on high-Q wavelength-sized cavities have not yet been realized. Here, we show large-scale (N&#160;&gt;&#160;100) ultrahigh-Q coupled nanocavity arrays based on photonic crystals. This is the first demonstration of large-scale coupled resonator arrays based on wavelength-sized cavities, in which tight-binding sinusoidal dispersion is seen. We confirm that an ultrahigh value of Q (&#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>) is maintained, even when N is large, and the resonators exhibit very low loss characteristics with regard to light propagation. The ultrahigh value of Q and small size has enabled us to achieve ultraslow light pulse propagation with a group velocity well below 0.01c and a long group delay.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1, Morinosato-Wakamiya Atsugi, Kanagawa, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Masaya Notomi"", "",\u00a0Eiichi Kuramochi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Takasumi Tanabe""]}, {""address"": ""CREST-JST, 4-1-8, Honmachi, Kawaguchi, 332-0012, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Masaya Notomi"", "",\u00a0Eiichi Kuramochi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Takasumi Tanabe""]}]",False,"[""Masaya Notomi"", ""Eiichi Kuramochi"", ""Takasumi Tanabe""]","Notomi, M., Kuramochi, E. & Tanabe, T.

article,Geometrodynamics of spinning light,"<p>The semiclassical evolution of spinning particles has recently been re-examined in condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and optics, resulting in the prediction of the intrinsic spin Hall effect associated with the Berry phase. A fundamental origin of this effect is related to the spin&#8211;orbit interaction and topological monopoles. Here, we report a unified theory and a direct observation of two mutual phenomena: a spin-dependent deflection (the spin Hall effect) of photons and the precession of the Stokes vector along the coiled ray trajectory of classical geometrical optics. Our measurements are in perfect agreement with theoretical predictions, thereby verifying the dynamical action of the topological Berry-phase monopole in the evolution of light. These results may have promising applications in nano-optics and can be immediately extrapolated to the evolution of massless particles in a variety of physical systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Micro and Nanooptics Laboratory, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, 32000, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Konstantin Y.
