letter,Magnetic-field-assisted terahertz quantum cascade laser operating up to 225 K,"<p>Advances in semiconductor bandgap engineering have resulted in the recent development of the terahertz&#160;quantum cascade laser. These compact optoelectronic devices now operate in the frequency range 1.2&#8211;5&#160;THz, although cryogenic cooling is still required. Further progress towards the realization of devices operating at higher temperatures and emitting at longer wavelengths (sub-terahertz quantum cascade lasers) is difficult because it requires maintaining a population inversion between closely spaced electronic sub-bands (1&#160;THz&#160;&#8776;&#160;4&#160;meV). Here, we demonstrate a magnetic-field-assisted quantum cascade laser based on the resonant-phonon design. By applying appropriate electrical bias and strong magnetic fields above 16&#160;T, it is possible to achieve laser emission from a single device over a wide range of frequencies (0.68&#8211;3.33&#160;THz). Owing to the suppression of inter-Landau-level non-radiative scattering, the device shows magnetic field assisted laser action at 1&#160;THz at temperatures up to 215&#160;K, and 3&#160;THz lasing up to 225&#160;K.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, 32310, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""A.

letter,Vertically emitting microdisk lasers,"<p>In microdisk lasers a ring resonator is formed by successive total internal reflections inside a circularly shaped waveguide. The photon lifetime of the resulting whispering gallery optical modes is limited mainly by the waveguide absorption. Light is usually coupled out by tunnelling owing to the disk curvature or through imperfections at the border, but the output power is hard to exploit in a potential application because the emission is mainly in the disk plane and isotropic. Here we realize vertically emitting whispering gallery lasers by implementing appropriate diffraction gratings along the disk circumference. We use terahertz quantum cascade structures and demonstrate a 50&#8211;fold increase in the optical power compared to devices without gratings, while at the same time engineering the lasing spectrum according to the grating rotational symmetry. This concept will allow the fabrication of compact arrays of single-mode terahertz sources with regular beam profiles and high output power.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NEST CNR-INFM, Scuola Normale Superiore, Piazza dei Cavalieri 7, Pisa, I-56126, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Lukas Mahler"", "",\u00a0Alessandro Tredicucci"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Fabio Beltram""]}, {""address"": ""Scuola Normale Superiore, Italian Institute of Technology UdR, Piazza dei Cavalieri 7, Pisa, I-56126, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Alessandro Tredicucci"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Fabio Beltram""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Electronics, ETH Z\u00fcrich, HPT H 7, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 16, CH-8093, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Christoph Walther"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0J\u00e9r\u00f4me Faist""]}, {""address"": ""Integrated Systems Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, ETZ J83, Gloriastrasse 35, CH-8092, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Bernd Witzigmann""]}, {""address"": ""Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, J J Thomson Avenue, Cambridge CB3 0HE, UK"", ""authors"": [""Harvey E.

letter,High k-space lasing in a dual-wavelength quantum cascade laser,"<p>The understanding of charge carrier distributions is fundamental to our knowledge of laser systems. In semiconductor lasers, because of the propensity of charge carriers to undergo extremely fast momentum relaxation, they accumulate at band extrema&#8212;that is, they have a small wavevector close to k&#160;&#8776;&#160;0 in direct-gap semiconductors. Conventional understanding suggests that the device-level physics occurs at these band extrema, including population inversion for lasing. This behaviour is universal in diode lasers, interband cascade lasers and quantum cascade lasers. Here, we report on a quantum cascade laser with an energy configuration able to establish local population inversion high in k-space. We observe dual-wavelength emission from two discrete optical transitions. Temperature-dependent performance attributes show that the two transitions are highly coupled; competition for charge carriers is apparent from the anti correlated behaviour. The two optical transitions represent a conventional quantum cascade laser transition at k&#160;&#8776;&#160;0 and another laser transition from non-thermal electrons near k&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>8</sup>&#160;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kale J.

letter,Ultrafast active plasmonics,"<p>Surface plasmon polaritons, propagating bound oscillations of electrons and light at a metal surface, have great potential as information carriers for next-generation, highly integrated nanophotonic devices. Since the term &#8216;active plasmonics&#8217; was coined in 2004, a number of techniques for controlling the propagation of guided surface plasmon polariton signals have been demonstrated. However, with sub-microsecond or nanosecond response times at best, these techniques are likely to be too slow for future applications in such fields as data transport and processing. Here we report that femtosecond optical frequency plasmon pulses can propagate along a metal&#8211;dielectric waveguide and that they can be modulated on the femtosecond timescale by direct ultrafast optical excitation of the metal, thereby offering unprecedented terahertz modulation bandwidth&#8212;a speed at least five orders of magnitude faster than existing technologies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Hampshire, UK"", ""authors"": [""Kevin F.

letter,Monolithic germanium/silicon avalanche photodiodes with 340 GHz gain–bandwidth product,"<p>Significant progress has been made recently in demonstrating that silicon photonics is a promising technology for low-cost optical detectors, modulators and light sources. It has often been assumed, however, that their performance is inferior to InP-based devices. Although this is true in most cases, one of the exceptions is the area of avalanche photodetectors, where silicon's material properties allow for high gain with less excess noise than InP-based avalanche photodetectors and a theoretical sensitivity improvement of 3&#160;dB or more. Here, we report a monolithically grown germanium/silicon avalanche photodetector with a gain&#8211;bandwidth product of 340&#160;GHz, a k<sub>eff</sub> of 0.09 and a sensitivity of &#8722;28&#160;dB&#160;m at 10&#160;Gb&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. This is the highest reported gain&#8211;bandwidth product for any avalanche photodetector operating at 1,300&#160;nm and a sensitivity that is equivalent to mature, commercially available III&#8211;V compound avalanche photodetectors.
