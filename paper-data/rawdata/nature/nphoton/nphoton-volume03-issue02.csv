letter,Complete optical isolation created by indirect interband photonic transitions,"<p>Achieving on-chip optical signal isolation is a fundamental difficulty in integrated photonics. The need to overcome this difficulty is becoming increasingly urgent, especially with the emergence of silicon nano-photonics, which promises to create on-chip optical systems at an unprecedented scale of integration. Until now, there have been no techniques that provide complete on-chip signal isolation using materials or processes that are fundamentally compatible with silicon CMOS processes. Based on the effects of photonic transitions, we show here that a linear, broadband and non-reciprocal isolation can be accomplished by spatial&#8211;temporal refractive index modulations that simultaneously impart frequency and wavevector shifts during the photonic transition process. We further show that a non-reciprocal effect can be accomplished in dynamically modulated micrometre-scale ring-resonator structures. This work demonstrates that on-chip isolation can be accomplished with dynamic photonic structures in standard material systems that are widely used for integrated optoelectronic applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Zongfu Yu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Shanhui Fan""]}]",False,"[""Zongfu Yu"", ""Shanhui Fan""]","Yu, Z., Fan, S.

letter,Observation of optical-fibre Kerr nonlinearity at the single-photon level,"<p>Optical fibres have proved to be an important medium for manipulating and generating light in applications including soliton transmission, light amplification, all-optical switching and supercontinuum generation. In the quantum regime, fibres may prove useful for ultralow-power all-optical signal processing and quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate the first experimental observation of optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level in an optical fibre. Taking advantage of the large nonlinearity and managed dispersion of photonic crystal fibres, we report very small (1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;7</sup> to &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>&#160;rad) conditional phase shifts induced by weak coherent pulses that contain one or less than one photon per pulse on average.

letter,Fourier transform spectroscopy with a laser frequency comb,"<p>Molecular fingerprinting using absorption spectroscopy is a powerful analytical method, particularly in the infrared, the region of intense spectral signatures. Fourier transform spectroscopy&#8212;the widely used and essential tool for broadband spectroscopy&#8212;enables the recording of multi-octave-spanning spectra, exhibiting 100&#160;MHz resolution with an accuracy of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> and 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;2</sup> in wavenumber and intensity determination, respectively. Typically, 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup> independent spectral elements may be measured simultaneously within a few hours, with only average sensitivity. Here, we show that by using laser frequency combs as the light source of Fourier transform spectroscopy it is possible to record well-resolved broadband absorption and dispersion spectra in a single experiment, from the beating signatures of neighbouring comb lines in the interferogram. The sensitivity is thus expected to increase by several orders of magnitude. Experimental proof of principle is here carried out on the 1.5-&#181;m overtone bands of acetylene, spanning 80&#160;nm with a resolution of 1.5&#160;GHz. Consequently, without any optical modification, the performance of Fourier spectrometers may be drastically boosted.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire de Photophysique Mol\u00e9culaire, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, B\u00e2timent 350, Cedex, 91405 Orsay, France"", ""authors"": [""Julien Mandon"", "",\u00a0Guy Guelachvili"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Nathalie Picqu\u00e9""]}]",False,"[""Julien Mandon"", ""Guy Guelachvili"", ""Nathalie Picqu\u00e9""]","Mandon, J., Guelachvili, G. & Picqué, N.

article,Four-wave-mixing stopped light in hot atomic rubidium vapour,"<p>Digital signal processing, holography, and quantum and classical information processing rely heavily upon recording the amplitude and phase of coherent optical signals. One method for achieving coherent information storage makes use of electromagnetically induced transparency. Storage is achieved by compressing the optical pulse using the steep dispersion of the electromagnetically induced transparency medium and then mapping the electric field to local atomic quantum-state superpositions. Here we show that nonlinear optical processes may enhance pulse compression and storage, and that information about the nonlinear process itself may be stored coherently. We report on a pulse storage scheme in hot atomic rubidium vapour, in which a four-wave-mixing normal mode is stored using a double-&#923; configuration. The entire (broadened) waveform of the input signal is recovered after several hundred microseconds (1/e time of about 120&#160;&#181;s), as well as a new optical mode (idler) generated from the four-wave-mixing process.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester, Rochester, 14627, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ryan M.

article,Determination of supramolecular structure and spatial distribution of protein complexes in living cells,"<p>Resonant energy transfer from an optically excited donor molecule to a non-excited acceptor molecule residing nearby is widely used to detect molecular interactions in living cells. To date, resonant energy transfer has been used to obtain stoichiometric information, such as the number of proteins forming a complex, for a handful of proteins, but only after performing sequential scans of the emission wavelengths, excitation wavelengths, or sometimes both. During this lengthy process of measurement, the molecular makeup of a cellular region may change, limiting the applicability of resonant energy transfer to the determination of cellular averages. Here, we demonstrate a method for the determination of protein complex size, configuration, and spatial distribution in single living cells. It relies on a spectrally resolved two-photon microscope, a simple but competent theory, and a judicious selection of fluorescent tags. This approach eventually may lead to tracking the dynamics of individual molecular complexes inside living cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 1900 E Kenwood Boulevard, Milwaukee, 53211, Wisconsin, USA"", ""authors"": [""Valerica Raicu"", "",\u00a0Michael R.
