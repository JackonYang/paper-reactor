letter,Photonic-chip-based radio-frequency spectrum analyser with terahertz bandwidth,"<p>Signal processing at terahertz speeds calls for an enormous leap in bandwidth beyond the current capabilities of electronics, for which practical operation is currently limited to tens of gigahertz. This can be achieved through all-optical schemes making use of the ultrafast response of &#967;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinear waveguides. Towards this objective, we have developed compact planar rib waveguides based on As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> glass, providing a virtual &#8216;lumped&#8217; high nonlinearity in a monolithic platform capable of integrating multiple functions. Here, we apply it to demonstrate, for the first time, a photonic-chip-based, all-optical, radio-frequency spectrum analyser with the performance advantages of distortion-free, broad measurement bandwidth (&gt;2.5&#160;THz) and flexible wavelength operation (that is, colourless). The key to this is the waveguide's high optical nonlinearity and dispersion-shifted design. Using the device, we characterize high-bit-rate (320&#160;Gb&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) optical signals impaired by various distortions. The demonstrated ultrafast, broadband capability highlights the potential for integrated chip-based signal processing at bit rates approaching and beyond Tb s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CUDOS, Institute for Photonic Optical Sciences (IPOS), School of Physics, University of Sydney, New South Wales, 2006, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Mark Pelusi"", "",\u00a0Feng Luan"", "",\u00a0Trung D.

letter,STED microscopy reveals crystal colour centres with nanometric resolution,"<p>Because they have spin states that can be optically polarized and detected, fluorescent nitrogen vacancies in diamond have considerable potential for applications in quantum cryptography and computation, as well as for nanoscale magnetic imaging and biolabelling. However, their optical detection and control are hampered by the diffraction resolution barrier of far-field optics. Here, we show that stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy is capable of imaging nitrogen-vacancy centres with nanoscale resolution and &#197;ngstr&#246;m precision using focused light. The far-field optical control of the population of their excited state at the nanoscale expands the versatility of these centres and demonstrates the suitability of STED microscopy to image dense colour centres in crystals. Nitrogen-vacancy defects show great potential as tags for far-field optical nanoscopy because they exhibit nearly ideal STED without bleaching. Measured point-spread functions of 5.8&#160;nm in width demonstrate an all-physics-based far-field optical resolving power exceeding the wavelength of light by two orders of magnitude.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of NanoBiophotonics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Am Fassberg 11, G\u00f6ttingen, 37077, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Eva Rittweger"", "",\u00a0Kyu Young Han"", "",\u00a0Scott E.

letter,A metamaterial solid-state terahertz phase modulator,"<p>Over the past two decades, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and quantum-cascade lasers have been two of the most important developments in terahertz science and technology. These technologies may contribute to a multitude of terahertz applications that are currently under investigation globally. However, the devices and components necessary to effectively manipulate terahertz radiation require substantial development beyond what has been accomplished to date. Here we demonstrate an electrically controlled planar hybrid metamaterial device that linearly controls the phase of terahertz radiation with constant insertion loss over a narrow frequency band. Alternatively, our device may operate as a broadband terahertz modulator because of the causal relation between the amplitude modulation and phase shifting. We perform terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, in which our hybrid metamaterial modulator replaces a commercial mechanical optical chopper, demonstrating comparable broadband performance and superior high-speed operation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Materials Physics & Applications Division, Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, 87545, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hou-Tong Chen"", "",\u00a0Abul K.

letter,Terahertz field enhancement by a metallic nano slit operating beyond the skin-depth limit,"<p>The unique optical properties of metals are at the core of many areas of research and applications, including plasmonics, metamaterials, superlensing and subdiffraction focusing, optical antennas and surface enhanced Raman scattering. One important length scale inherent in metamaterials and plasmonics research activities in the microwave, terahertz, infrared, visible and ultraviolet ranges is the skin depth of metal, which remains at the submicrometre level throughout the broad spectral range. One prominent question is whether terahertz electromagnetic waves can be controlled on the nanoscale to achieve new functionalities in the sub-skin-depth regime.

article,Stereometamaterials,"<p>The subdiscipline of chemistry that studies molecular structures in three dimensions is called stereochemistry. One important aspect of stereochemistry is stereoisomers: materials with the same chemical formula but different spatial arrangements of atoms within molecules. The relative positions of atoms have great influence on the properties of chemical substances. Here, in analogy to stereoisomers in chemistry, we propose a new concept in nanophotonics, namely stereometamaterials, which refer to metamaterials with the same constituents but different spatial arrangements. As a model system of stereometamaterials, we theoretically and experimentally study meta-dimers, which consist of a stack of two identical split-ring resonators in each unit cell with various twist angles. The interplay of electric and magnetic interactions plays a crucial role for the optical properties. Specifically, the influence of higher-order electric multipoles becomes clearly evident. The twisting of stereometamaterials offers a way to engineer complex plasmonic nanostructures with a tailored electromagnetic response.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""4.

article,III-nitride photonic-crystal light-emitting diodes with high extraction efficiency,"<p>Light-emitting diodes are becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to conventional light sources due to their small size, high efficiency and long lifetime. Ongoing research is dedicated to improving their performance through the use of more efficient light-generating and light-extracting structures. Here, we demonstrate light-emitting diodes achieving high extraction efficiency by using photonic crystals. The structures are iii-nitride thin-film light-emitting diodes emitting at &#955;&#160;=&#160;450&#160;nm. The photonic-crystal layer provides superior optical mode control compared to conventional iii-nitride light-emitting diodes, efficiently coupling guided modes out of the light-emitting diode. Fabry&#8211;Perot and photonic-crystal induced modes are observed in the far-field radiation patterns and are matched to theoretical electromagnetic calculations. The optical mode control results in a high-performance light-emitting diode with an estimated unencapsulated light extraction of &#8764;73%, higher than any unencapsulated iii-nitride light-emitting diode measured to date.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Advanced Laboratories, Philips Lumileds Lighting Co., 370 W.
