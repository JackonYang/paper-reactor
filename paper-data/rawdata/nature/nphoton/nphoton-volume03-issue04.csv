letter,Green light emission in silicon through slow-light enhanced third-harmonic generation in photonic-crystal waveguides,"<p>Slow light has attracted significant interest recently as a potential solution for optical delay lines and time-domain optical signal processing. Perhaps even more significant is the possibility of dramatically enhancing nonlinear optical effects due to the spatial compression of optical energy. Two-dimensional silicon photonic-crystal waveguides have proven to be a powerful platform for realizing slow light, being compatible with on-chip integration and offering wide-bandwidth and dispersion-free propagation. Here, we report the slow-light enhancement of a nonlinear optical process in a two-dimensional silicon photonic-crystal waveguide. We observe visible third-harmonic-generation at a wavelength of 520&#160;nm with only a few watts of peak power, and demonstrate strong third-harmonic-generation enhancement due to the reduced group velocity of the near-infrared pump signal. This demonstrates yet another unexpected nonlinear function realized in a CMOS-compatible silicon waveguide.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CUDOS, Institute for Photonic Optical Sciences (IPOS), School of Physics, University of Sydney, 2006, New South Wales, Australia"", ""authors"": [""B.

letter,Imaging through nonlinear media using digital holography,"<p>It is well known that one cannot image directly through a nonlinear medium, as intensity-dependent phase changes distort signals as they propagate. Indirect methods can be used, but none has allowed for the measurement of internal wave mixing and dynamics. Recently, the reconstruction of nonlinear pulse propagation in fibres was demonstrated by generalizing the techniques of digital holography to the nonlinear domain. The method involves two steps: (1) recording the total field (both amplitude and phase) exiting a nonlinear medium and (2) numerically back-propagating the wavefunction. Here, we extend this process to two-dimensional spatial beams and experimentally demonstrate it in a self-defocusing photorefractive crystal, giving examples in soliton formation, dispersive radiation and imaging. For known nonlinearity, the technique enables reconstruction of wave dynamics within the medium and suggests new methods of super-resolved imaging, including subwavelength microscopy and lithography. For unknown nonlinearity, the method facilitates modelling and characterization of the optical response.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Christopher Barsi"", "",\u00a0Wenjie Wan"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jason W.

letter,All-optical high-speed signal processing with silicon–organic hybrid slot waveguides,"<p>Integrated optical circuits based on silicon-on-insulator technology are likely to become the mainstay of the photonics industry. Over recent years an impressive range of silicon-on-insulator devices has been realized, including waveguides, filters and photonic-crystal devices. However, silicon-based all-optical switching is still challenging owing to the slow dynamics of two-photon generated free carriers. Here we show that silicon&#8211;organic hybrid integration overcomes such intrinsic limitations by combining the best of two worlds, using mature CMOS processing to fabricate the waveguide, and molecular beam deposition to cover it with organic molecules that efficiently mediate all-optical interaction without introducing significant absorption. We fabricate a 4-mm-long silicon&#8211;organic hybrid waveguide with a record nonlinearity coefficient of &#947;&#160;&#8776;&#160;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup>&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;km<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and perform all-optical demultiplexing of 170.8&#160;Gb&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to 42.7&#160;Gb&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

article,Heat-assisted magnetic recording by a near-field transducer with efficient optical energy transfer,"<p>Although near-field microscopy has allowed optical imaging with sub-20 nm resolution, the optical throughput of this technique is notoriously small. As a result, applications such as optical data storage have been impractical. However, with an optimized near-field transducer design, we show that optical energy can be transferred efficiently to a lossy metallic medium and yet remain confined in a spot that is much smaller than the diffraction limit. Such a transducer was integrated into a recording head and flown over a magnetic recording medium on a rotating disk. Optical power from a semiconductor laser at a wavelength of 830 nm was efficiently coupled by the transducer into the medium to heat a 70-nm track above the Curie point in nanoseconds and record data at an areal density of &#8764;375 Tb m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>.

article,A gigahertz-bandwidth atomic probe based on the slow-light Faraday effect,"<p>The ability to probe quantum systems on short timescales is central to the advancement of quantum technology. Here we show that this is possible using an off-resonant dispersive probe. By applying a magnetic field to an atomic vapour the spectra of the group index for left and right circularly polarized light become displaced, leading to a slow-light Faraday effect that results in large dispersion and high transmission over tens of gigahertz. This large frequency range opens up the possibility of probing dynamics on a nanosecond timescale. In addition, we show that the group index enhances the spectral sensitivity of the polarization rotation, giving large rotations of up to 15&#960;&#160;rad for continuous-wave light. Finally, we demonstrate dynamic broadband pulse switching by rotating a linearly polarized nanosecond pulse by &#960;/2&#160;rad with negligible distortion and transmission close to unity.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Durham University, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK"", ""authors"": [""Paul Siddons"", "",\u00a0Nia C.
