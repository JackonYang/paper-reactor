letter,Co-existence of strongly and weakly localized random laser modes,"<p>Recent theoretical work on random lasing predicts that the occurrence of narrow lasing spikes can be caused by both localized and extended modes of light. Typical random lasing spikes have been observed in powders of zinc oxide nanoparticles, but identifying the possible degrees of localization of such modes has until now been an open issue. In this Letter we present an experimental procedure that directly extracts the area of localization of the modes. This method relies on the investigation of micro-structured fields of zinc oxide powder, which also allows direct correlation to the local structural properties of the ensemble of subwavelength particles by scanning electron microscopy. We find that lasing from both localized and extended modes can be observed simultaneously. Our observation also corroborates the prediction that localized modes have a lower loss rate than that of extended modes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Physik, Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe (TH), Wolfgang-Gaede-Strasse 1, Karlsruhe, 76131, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Johannes Fallert"", "",\u00a0Roman J.

letter,Electrical detection of confined gap plasmons in metal–insulator–metal waveguides,"<p>Plasmonic waveguides offer promise in providing a solution to the bandwidth limitations of classical electrical interconnections. Fast, low-loss and error-free signal transmission has been achieved in long-range surface plasmon polariton waveguides. Deep subwavelength plasmonic waveguides with short propagation lengths have also been demonstrated, showing the possibility of matching the sizes of optics and today's electronic components. However, in order to combine surface plasmon waveguides with electronic circuits, new high-bandwidth electro-optical transducers need to be developed. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the electrical detection of surface plasmon polaritons in metallic slot waveguides. By means of an integrated metal&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;metal photodetector, highly confined surface plasmon polaritons in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal waveguide are detected and characterized. This approach of integrating electro-optical components in metallic waveguides could lead to the development of advanced active plasmonic devices and high-bandwidth on-chip plasmonic circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IMEC, NextNS group, Kapeldreef 75, Leuven, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Pieter Neutens"", "",\u00a0Pol Van Dorpe"", "",\u00a0Iwijn De Vlaminck"", "",\u00a0Liesbet Lagae"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gustaaf Borghs""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200 D, Leuven, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Pieter Neutens""]}]",False,"[""Pieter Neutens"", ""Pol Van Dorpe"", ""Iwijn De Vlaminck"", ""Liesbet Lagae"", ""Gustaaf Borghs""]","Neutens, P., Van Dorpe, P., De Vlaminck, I. et al.

letter,Controlling the near-field oscillations of loaded plasmonic nanoantennas,"<p>Optical and infrared antennas enable a variety of cutting-edge applications ranging from nanoscale photodetectors to highly sensitive biosensors. All these applications critically rely on the optical near-field interaction between the antenna and its &#8216;load&#8217; (biomolecules or semiconductors). However, it is largely unexplored how antenna loading affects the near-field response. Here, we use scattering-type near-field microscopy to monitor the evolution of the near-field oscillations of infrared gap antennas progressively loaded with metallic bridges of varying size. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that the local near-field amplitude and phase can be controlled by antenna loading, in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. By modelling the antenna loads as nanocapacitors and nanoinductors, we show that the change of near-field patterns induced by the load can be understood within the framework of circuit theory. Targeted antenna loading provides an excellent means of engineering complex antenna configurations in coherent control applications, adaptive nano-optics and metamaterials.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nanooptics Laboratory, CIC nanoGUNE, 20018 Donostia \u2013 San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Electrofluidic displays using Young–Laplace transposition of brilliant pigment dispersions,"<p>Conventional electrowetting displays reconfigure the contact angle of a coloured oil film on a planar hydrophobic surface. We report on electrofluidic displays, in particular a three-dimensional microfluidic display device that provides a direct view of brilliantly coloured pigment dispersions. Electromechanical pressure is used to pull the aqueous dispersion from a reservoir of small viewable area (&lt;10%) into a surface channel of large viewable area (&gt;90%). The hydrophobic channel and reservoir respectively impart a small or large radius of curvature on the dispersion. Therefore, with no voltage, Young&#8211;Laplace pressure forces the dispersion to retract into the reservoir. Preliminary prototypes exhibit &#8764;55% white reflectance, and future development points towards a reflectance of &#8764;85%. Uniquely, compared to electrowetting pixels, the electrofluidic pixels reduce the visible area of the coloured fluid by an additional two to three times (improving contrast), are potentially bistable, are as thin as &#8764;15 &#181;m (giving potential for rollable displays), and can be miniaturized without increased operating voltage.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Novel Devices Laboratory, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, 45221, Ohio, USA"", ""authors"": [""J.
