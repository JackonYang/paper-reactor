progress article,Infrared photovoltaics made by solution processing,"<p>Solution-processed photovoltaics offer a cost-effective path to harvesting the abundant resource that is solar energy. The organic and polymer semiconductors at the heart of these devices generally absorb only visible light; however, half of the Sun's power reaching the Earth's surface lies in the infrared. Flexible solar cells that harvest wavelengths beyond 1 &#956;m were first reported in 2005. In three years they have increased over 10,000-fold in power conversion efficiency. The latest devices achieve power conversion efficiencies in the infrared of more than 4%, values comparable to those of their organic and polymer counterparts in the visible. Here we review the progress and prospects for the field, focusing on new insights into how quantum-dot solar cells operate and how these findings give guidance on optimizing these devices to their full performance potential.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 10 King's College Road, Toronto, M5S 3G4, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Edward H.

letter,Near-infrared imaging with quantum-dot-sensitized organic photodiodes,"<p>Solution-processed photodiodes with infrared sensitivities at wavelengths beyond the bandgap of silicon (corresponding to a wavelength of &#8764;1,100 nm) would be a significant advance towards cost-effective imaging. Colloidal quantum dots are highly suitable as infrared absorbers for photodetection, but high quantum yields have only been reported with photoconductors. For imaging, photodiodes are required to ensure low-power operation and compatibility to active matrix backplanes. Organic bulk heterojunctions are attractive as solution-processable diodes, but are limited to use in the visible spectrum. Here, we report the fabrication and application of hybrid bulk heterojunction photodiodes containing PbS nanocrystalline quantum dots as sensitizers for near-infrared detection up to 1.8 &#181;m, with rectification ratios of &#8764;6,000, minimum lifetimes of one year and external quantum efficiencies of up to 51%. By integration of the solution-processed devices on amorphous silicon active matrix backplanes, we demonstrate for the first time near-infrared imaging with organic/inorganic hybrid photodiodes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Siemens AG, Corporate Technology, CT MM1, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Tobias Rauch"", "",\u00a0Sandro F.

letter,Observing angular deviations in the specular reflection of a light beam,"<p>The Law of Reflection of a light ray incident upon a mirror (&#952;<sub>in</sub>&#160;=&#160;&#952;<sub>out</sub>) was first formulated by Euclid around 300 bc in his book Catoptrics; it has been a tenet of geometrical optics ever since. However, more recently, a small angular deviation of the Law of Reflection has been predicted for a physical light beam when this is regarded as the implementation of a ray. The deviation is a diffractive consequence of the angular dependence of the reflectivity and should occur for any mirror with less than 100% reflectivity. We report here experimental proof of this angular deviation by determining the direction of an optical beam after reflection from an air&#8211;glass interface, using a position detector with nanometre resolution. Our results are relevant for angular metrology in general and cantilever-based surface microscopies in particular. Analogous angular deviations are expected for reflection of acoustic waves and quantum matter waves.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Huygens Laboratory, Leiden University, PO Box 9504, Leiden, 2300RA, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,High-performance crosslinked colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting diodes,"<p>Colloidal quantum-dot light-emitting diodes have recently received considerable attention due to their ease of colour tunability, high brightness and narrow emission bandwidth. Although there have been rapid advances in luminance, efficiency and lifetime, device performance is still limited by the large energy barriers for hole and electron injection into the quantum-dot layer. Here, we show that by crosslinking the colloidal quantum-dot layer, the charge injection barrier in a red-light-emitting quantum-dot light-emitting diode may be considerably reduced by using a sol&#8211;gel TiO<sub>2</sub> layer for electron transport. The device architecture is compatible with all-solution device fabrication and the resulting device shows a high luminance (12,380&#160;cd&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>), low turn-on voltage (1.9&#160;V) and high power efficiency (2.41&#160;lm&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Incorporation of the technology into a display device with an active matrix drive backplane suggests that the approach has promise for use in high-performance, easy-to-fabricate, large-area displays and illumination sources.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Frontier Research Lab, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Gyeonggi-Do, 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Kyung-Sang Cho"", "",\u00a0Eun Kyung Lee"", "",\u00a0Tae-Ho Kim"", "",\u00a0Sang Jin Lee"", "",\u00a0Byoung Lyong Choi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jong Min Kim""]}, {""address"": ""Materials Research Lab, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Gyeonggi-Do, 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Won-Jae Joo"", "",\u00a0Eunjoo Jang"", "",\u00a0Soon-Jae Kwon"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Byung-Ki Kim""]}, {""address"": ""Display Lab, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Gyeonggi-Do, 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jai Yong Han""]}]",False,"[""Kyung-Sang Cho"", ""Eun Kyung Lee"", ""Won-Jae Joo"", ""Eunjoo Jang"", ""Tae-Ho Kim"", ""Sang Jin Lee"", ""Soon-Jae Kwon"", ""Jai Yong Han"", ""Byung-Ki Kim"", ""Byoung Lyong Choi"", ""Jong Min Kim""]","Cho, K., Lee, E., Joo, W. et al.

article,Manipulation of multiphoton entanglement in waveguide quantum circuits,"<p>On-chip integrated photonic circuits are crucial to further progress towards quantum technologies and in the science of quantum optics. Here we report precise control of single photon states and multiphoton entanglement directly on-chip. We manipulate the state of path-encoded qubits using integrated optical phase control based on resistive elements, observing an interference contrast of 98.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3%. We demonstrate integrated quantum metrology by observing interference fringes with two- and four-photon entangled states generated in a waveguide circuit, with respective interference contrasts of 97.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4% and 92&#160;&#177;&#160;4%, sufficient to beat the standard quantum limit. Finally, we demonstrate a reconfigurable circuit that continuously and accurately tunes the degree of quantum interference, yielding a maximum visibility of 98.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9%.

article,Rapid and precise absolute distance measurements at long range,"<p>The ability to determine absolute distance to an object is one of the most basic measurements of remote sensing. High-precision ranging has important applications in both large-scale manufacturing and in future tight formation-flying satellite missions, where rapid and precise measurements of absolute distance are critical for maintaining the relative pointing and position of the individual satellites. Using two coherent broadband fibre-laser frequency comb sources, we demonstrate a coherent laser ranging system that combines the advantages of time-of-flight and interferometric approaches to provide absolute distance measurements, simultaneously from multiple reflectors, and at low power. The pulse time-of-flight yields a precision of 3&#160;&#181;m with an ambiguity range of 1.5&#160;m in 200&#160;&#181;s. Through the optical carrier phase, the precision is improved to better than 5&#160;nm at 60&#160;ms, and through the radio-frequency phase the ambiguity range is extended to 30&#160;km, potentially providing 2 parts in 10<sup>13</sup> ranging at long distances.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Standards and Technology, 325 Broadway M.S. 815 Boulder, Colorado, 80305, USA"", ""authors"": [""I.
