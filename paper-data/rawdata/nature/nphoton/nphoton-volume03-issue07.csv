progress article,Diffraction-unlimited three-dimensional optical nanoscopy with opposing lenses,"<p>The resolution of far-field optical microscopy stagnated for a century, but a quest began in the 1990s leading to nanoscale imaging of transparent fluorescent objects in three dimensions. Important elements in this pursuit were the synthesis of the aperture of two opposing lenses and the modulation or switching of the fluorescence of adjacent markers. The first element provided nearly isotropic three-dimensional resolution by improving the axial resolution by three- to sevenfold, and the second enabled the diffraction barrier to be overcome. Here, we review recent progress in the synergistic combination of these two elements which non-invasively provide an isotropic diffraction-unlimited three-dimensional resolution in transparent objects.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of NanoBiophotonics, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, G\u00f6ttingen, 37070, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Stefan W.

letter,Nonlinear generation and manipulation of Airy beams,"<p>Recently, the first experimental observation of a new class of non-diffracting optical beams that freely accelerate in space was reported. These so-called Airy beams were shown to be useful for optical micro-manipulation of small particles and for the generation of curved plasma channels in air. To date, these beams have been generated only by using linear diffractive elements. Here, we show a new way of generating Airy beams by using three-wave mixing processes, which occur in asymmetric nonlinear photonic crystals. We experimentally generated a second-harmonic Airy beam and examined the tuning properties of the nonlinear interaction and propagation dynamics of the pump and second-harmonic output beams. This nonlinear generation process enables Airy beams to be obtained at new wavelengths, and opens up new possibilities for all-optical switching and manipulation of Airy beams.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physical Electronics, Fleischman Faculty of Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, 69978, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Tal Ellenbogen"", "",\u00a0Noa Voloch-Bloch"", "",\u00a0Ayelet Ganany-Padowicz"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ady Arie""]}]",False,"[""Tal Ellenbogen"", ""Noa Voloch-Bloch"", ""Ayelet Ganany-Padowicz"", ""Ady Arie""]","Ellenbogen, T., Voloch-Bloch, N., Ganany-Padowicz, A. et al.

letter,Optical entanglement of co-propagating modes,"<p>Optical entanglement is a key requirement for many quantum communication protocols. Conventionally, entanglement is formed between two distinct beams, with the quantum correlation measurements being performed at separate locations. Such setups can be complicated, requiring the repeated combination of complex resources, a task that becomes increasingly difficult as the number of entangled information channels, or modes, increases. We pave the way towards the realization of optical multimode quantum information systems by showing continuous variable entanglement between two spatial modes within one beam. Our technique is a major advance towards practical systems with minimum complexity. We demonstrate three major experimental achievements. First, only one source is required to produce squeezed light in two orthogonal spatial modes. Second, entanglement is formed through lenses and beam rotation, without the need for a beamsplitter. Finally, quantum correlations are measured directly and simultaneously using a multipixel quadrant detector.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum-Atom Optics, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"", ""authors"": [""J.

article,Increased light harvesting in dye-sensitized solar cells with energy relay dyes,"<p>Conventional dye-sensitized solar cells have excellent charge collection efficiencies, high open-circuit voltages and good fill factors. However, dye-sensitized solar cells do not completely absorb all of the photons from the visible and near-infrared domain and consequently have lower short-circuit photocurrent densities than inorganic photovoltaic devices. Here, we present a new design where high-energy photons are absorbed by highly photoluminescent chromophores unattached to the titania and undergo F&#246;rster resonant energy transfer to the sensitizing dye. This novel architecture allows for broader spectral absorption, an increase in dye loading, and relaxes the design requirements for the sensitizing dye. We demonstrate a 26% increase in power conversion efficiency when using an energy relay dye (PTCDI) with an organic sensitizing dye (TT1). We estimate the average excitation transfer efficiency in this system to be at least 47%. This system offers a viable pathway to develop more efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Material Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305-4045, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Brian E.

article,Multispectral opto-acoustic tomography of deep-seated fluorescent proteins in vivo,"<p>Fluorescent proteins have become essential reporter molecules for studying life at the cellular and sub-cellular level, re-defining the ways in which we investigate biology. However, because of intense light scattering, most organisms and tissues remain inaccessible to current fluorescence microscopy techniques at depths beyond several hundred micrometres. We describe a multispectral opto-acoustic tomography technique capable of high-resolution visualization of fluorescent proteins deep within highly light-scattering living organisms. The method uses multiwavelength illumination over multiple projections combined with selective-plane opto-acoustic detection for artifact-free data collection. Accurate image reconstruction is enabled by making use of wavelength-dependent light propagation models in tissue. By performing whole-body imaging of two biologically important and optically diffuse model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster pupae and adult zebrafish, we demonstrate the facility to resolve tissue-specific expression of eGFP and mCherrry fluorescent proteins for precise morphological and functional observations in vivo.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Biological and Medical Imaging, Technical University of Munich and Helmholtz Center Munich, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstra\u00dfe 1, Neuherberg, D-85764, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Daniel Razansky"", "",\u00a0Rui Ma"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Vasilis Ntziachristos""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Developmental Genetics, Helmholtz Center Munich, Ingolst\u00e4dter Landstra\u00dfe 1, Neuherberg, D-85764, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Martin Distel"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Reinhard W.
