letter,Silicon nanostructure cloak operating at optical frequencies,"<p>The ability to render objects invisible using a cloak (such that they are not detectable by an external observer) has long been a tantalizing goal. Here, we demonstrate a cloak operating in the near infrared at a wavelength of 1,550&#160;nm. The cloak conceals a deformation on a flat reflecting surface, under which an object can be hidden. The device has an area of 225&#160;&#181;m<sup>2</sup> and hides a region of 1.6&#160;&#181;m<sup>2</sup>. It is composed of nanometre-size silicon structures with spatially varying densities across the cloak. The density variation is defined using transformation optics to define the effective index distribution of the cloak.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nanophotonics Group, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 209 Phillips Hall"", ""authors"": [""Lucas H.

letter,Tunable bipolar optical interactions between guided lightwaves,"<p>State-of-the-art advances in nanoscale optomechanics allow light to be guided in free-standing waveguides or resonators. In closely spaced devices, the coupling between the guided lightwaves gives rise to an optical force known as the &#8216;optical bonding force&#8217;. Indeed, attractive optical force has been observed in substrate coupled devices. According to recent theoretical predictions, the optical force should show bipolar behaviour depending on the relative phase between in-plane coupled lightwaves. So far, such an in-plane optical force has not been measured. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a bipolar optical force between planarly coupled nanophotonic waveguides. Both attractive and repulsive optical forces are obtained. The sign of the force can be switched reversibly by tuning the relative phase of the interacting lightwaves. This highly engineerable force of bipolar nature could be used as the operation principle for a new class of planar light force devices and circuits on a CMOS-compatible platform.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, 06511, Connecticut, USA"", ""authors"": [""Mo Li"", "",\u00a0W.

letter,Phase shaping of single-photon wave packets,"<p>Although the phase of a coherent light field can be precisely known, this is not true for the phase of the individual photons that create the field, considered individually. Phase changes within single-photon wave packets, however, have observable effects. In fact, actively controlling the phase of individual photons has been identified as a powerful resource for quantum communication protocols. Here we demonstrate arbitrary phase control of a single photon. The phase modulation is applied without affecting the photon's amplitude profile and is verified by means of a two-photon quantum interference measurement, demonstrating fermionic spatial behaviour of photon pairs. Combined with previously demonstrated control of a single photon's amplitude, frequency, and polarization, the fully deterministic phase shaping presented here allows for the complete control of single-photon wave packets.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Hans-Kopfermann-Strasse 1, Garching, 85748, Germany"", ""authors"": [""H.

letter,Pressure-assisted tip-enhanced Raman imaging at a resolution of a few nanometres,"<p>Scanning probe microscopy methods can image samples with extremely high resolutions, opening up a wide range of applications in physics, chemistry and biology. However, these passive techniques, which trace the sample surface softly, give indirect topographic information. Here, we show an active imaging technique that has the potential to achieve optically a molecular resolution by directly interacting and perturbing the sample molecules. This technique makes use of an external pressure, applied selectively on a nanometric volume of the sample through the apex of a sharp nanotip, to obtain a local distortion of only those molecules that are pressurized. The vibrational frequencies of these molecules are distinctly different from those of unpressurized molecules. By sensing this difference, our active microscopic technique can achieve extremely high resolution. Using an isolated single-walled carbon nanotube and a two-dimensional adenine nanocrystal, we demonstrate a spatial resolution of 4&#160;nm.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Osaka University, Suita, 565-0871, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Taka-aki Yano"", "",\u00a0Prabhat Verma"", "",\u00a0Taro Ichimura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Satoshi Kawata""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Suita, 565-0871, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Prabhat Verma""]}, {""address"": ""Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Suita, 565-0871, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yuika Saito""]}, {""address"": ""Nanophotonics Laboratory, RIKEN, Wako, 351-0198, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Satoshi Kawata""]}]",False,"[""Taka-aki Yano"", ""Prabhat Verma"", ""Yuika Saito"", ""Taro Ichimura"", ""Satoshi Kawata""]","Yano, T., Verma, P., Saito, Y. et al.
