letter,Optical cleaning of congruent lithium niobate crystals,"<p>Lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>), also called the &#8216;silicon of photonics&#8217;, is indispensable in advanced photonics and nonlinear optics. For many applications, however, the material is too polluted by transition metals, which are unavoidable at the parts per million level. These impurities serve as sources and traps for photoelectrons, causing optical damage and hampering the usability of LiNbO<sub>3</sub>. Efforts have therefore been made to get rid of the photoexcitable electrons. Here we introduce a method termed &#8216;optical cleaning&#8217;. We show theoretically and experimentally that, if the material is heated to moderate temperatures, allowing ions to migrate and to maintain charge neutrality, an appropriately moving light beam pushes photoexcitable electrons out of the illuminated region like a brush, and provides exponential cleaning. This promises purification levels that are beyond the reach of current technologies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Physics, University of Bonn, Wegelerstr. 8, Bonn, D-53115, Germany"", ""authors"": [""M.

letter,Radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale,"<p>Heat can be exchanged between two surfaces through emission and absorption of thermal radiation. It has been predicted theoretically that for distances smaller than the peak wavelength of the blackbody spectrum, radiative heat transfer can be increased by the contribution of evanescent waves. This contribution can be viewed as energy tunnelling through the gap between the surfaces. Although these effects have already been observed, a detailed quantitative comparison between theory and experiments in the nanometre regime is still lacking. Here, we report an experimental setup that allows measurement of conductance for gaps varying between 30&#160;nm and 2.5&#160;&#181;m. Our measurements pave the way for the design of submicrometre nanoscale heaters that could be used for heat-assisted magnetic recording or heat-assisted lithography.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Charles Fabry, Institut d Optique, CNRS, Univ Paris-sud, Campus Polytechnique, RD 128, Palaiseau, 91127, France"", ""authors"": [""Emmanuel Rousseau"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jean-Jacques Greffet""]}, {""address"": ""Institut N\u00e9el \u2013 CNRS and Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, 38042, France"", ""authors"": [""Alessandro Siria"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jo\u00ebl Chevrier""]}, {""address"": ""CEA/LETI MINATEC/DIHS/LCMS, 17 rue des Martyrs, Grenoble cedex 9, 38054, France"", ""authors"": [""Alessandro Siria"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Guillaume Jourdan""]}, {""address"": ""ESRF, 6 rue Horowitz, Grenoble Cedex, 38042, France"", ""authors"": [""Fabio Comin""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratoire EM2C-CNRS UPR 288, \u00c9cole Centrale Paris, Grande voie des vignes, Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, 92295, France"", ""authors"": [""Sebastian Volz""]}]",False,"[""Emmanuel Rousseau"", ""Alessandro Siria"", ""Guillaume Jourdan"", ""Sebastian Volz"", ""Fabio Comin"", ""Jo\u00ebl Chevrier"", ""Jean-Jacques Greffet""]","Rousseau, E., Siria, A., Jourdan, G. et al.

letter,Ultralong quantum optical data storage using an optical locking technique,"<p>Several types of quantum memory protocols have been presented over the last ten years, including photon echoes, off-resonant Raman scattering, ultraslow light-based quantum mapping processes and resonant Raman optical echoes. These quantum optical memory protocols are limited by a storage time on a scale as short as milliseconds, determined by the spin phase decay time of the storage medium. For applications of long-distance quantum communications, a quantum repeater composed of quantum entanglement swapping and quantum memory must be used. Achieving longer storage times in quantum memory therefore brings a definite advantage to applications of quantum repeaters for long-distance quantum communications. Here, we propose a quantum optical data storage protocol to extend the storage time by several orders of magnitude beyond the conventional limitation of the order of milliseconds. The present ultralong quantum optical storage technique is achieved by introducing an optical locking method to the resonant Raman optical echo protocol.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Photon Information Processing and the Graduate School of Information and Communications, Inha University, 253 Younghyun-dong, Nam-gu, Incheon, 402-751, S.

article,Single-shot terahertz-field-driven X-ray streak camera,"<p>A few-femtosecond X-ray streak camera has been realized using a pump&#8211;probe scheme that samples the transient response of matter to ionizing soft X-ray radiation in the presence of an intense synchronized terahertz field. Borrowing its concept from attosecond metrology, the femtosecond X-ray streak camera fills the gap between conventional streak cameras with typical resolutions of hundreds of femtoseconds and streaking techniques operating in the sub-femtosecond regime. Its single-shot capability permits the duration and time structure of individual X-ray pulses to be determined. For several classes of experiments in time-resolved spectroscopy, diffraction or imaging envisaged with novel accelerator- and laser-based short-pulse X-ray sources this knowledge is essential, but represents a major challenge to X-ray metrology.

article,Frequency comb assisted diode laser spectroscopy for measurement of microcavity dispersion,"<p>Although invented for precision measurements of single atomic transitions, frequency combs have also become a versatile tool for broadband spectroscopy in recent years. Here, we present a novel and simple approach for broadband spectroscopy, combining the accuracy of an optical fibre-laser-based frequency comb with the ease of use of a tunable external cavity diode laser. The scheme enables broadband and fast spectroscopy of more than 4&#160;THz bandwidth at scanning speeds up to 1&#160;THz&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at sub-MHz resolution. We use this method for spectroscopy of microresonator modes and precise measurements of their dispersion, which is relevant in the context of broadband optical frequency comb generation, having recently been demonstrated in these devices. Moreover, we find excellent agreement between measured microresonator dispersion with predicted values from finite element simulations, and we show that microresonator dispersion can be tailored by adjusting their geometrical properties.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Garching, 85748, Germany"", ""authors"": [""P.

article,Structural colour printing using a magnetically tunable and lithographically fixable photonic crystal,"<p>Many creatures in nature, such as butterflies and peacocks, display unique brilliant colours, known as &#8216;structural colours&#8217;, which result from the interaction of light with periodic nanostructures on their surfaces. Mimicking such nanostructures found in nature, however, requires state-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques that are slow, expensive and not scalable. Herein, we demonstrate high-resolution patterning of multiple structural colours within seconds, based on successive tuning and fixing of colour using a single material along with a maskless lithography system. We have invented a material called &#8216;M-Ink&#8217;, the colour of which is tunable by magnetically changing the periodicity of the nanostructure and fixable by photochemically immobilizing those structures in a polymer network. We also demonstrate a flexible photonic crystal for the realization of structural colour printing. The simple, controllable and scalable structural colour printing scheme presented may have a significant impact on colour production for general consumer goods.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University San 56-1, Shillim 9-dong, Gwanak-ku, Seoul, 151-744, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Hyoki Kim"", "",\u00a0Junhoi Kim"", "",\u00a0Sung-eun Choi"", "",\u00a0Hosuk Lee"", "",\u00a0Howon Lee"", "",\u00a0Wook Park"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sunghoon Kwon""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, University of California Riverside, California, 92521, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jianping Ge"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yadong Yin""]}]",False,"[""Hyoki Kim"", ""Jianping Ge"", ""Junhoi Kim"", ""Sung-eun Choi"", ""Hosuk Lee"", ""Howon Lee"", ""Wook Park"", ""Yadong Yin"", ""Sunghoon Kwon""]","Kim, H., Ge, J., Kim, J. et al.
