letter,Excitonic switches operating at around 100 K,"<p>Photonic and optoelectronic devices may offer the opportunity to realize efficient signal processing at speeds higher than in conventional electronic devices. Switches form the building blocks for circuits, and fast photonic switches have been realized. Recently, a proof of principle demonstration of exciton optoelectronic devices was reported. The potential advantages of excitonic devices include high operation and interconnection speed, small dimensions and the opportunity to combine many elements into integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate experimental proof of principle for the operation of excitonic switching devices at temperatures around 100&#160;K. The devices are based on an AlAs/GaAs coupled quantum well structure and include the exciton optoelectronic transistor (EXOT), the excitonic bridge modulator (EXBM), and the excitonic pinch-off modulator (EXPOM). A two orders of magnitude increase in the operation temperature compared to earlier devices (1.5&#160;K; refs&#160;) is achieved.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, 92093-0319, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""G.

letter,Ultrafast waveform compression using a time-domain telescope,"<p>Photonic systems provide access to extremely large bandwidths, which can approach a petahertz. Unfortunately, full utilization of this bandwidth is not achievable using standard electro-optical technologies, and higher (&gt;100&#160;GHz) performance requires all-optical processing with nonlinear-optical elements. A solution to the implementation of these elements in robust, compact and efficient systems is emerging in photonic integrated circuits, as evidenced by their recent application in various ultrahigh-bandwidth instruments. These devices enable the characterization of extremely complex signals by linking the high-speed optical domain with slower speed electronics. Here, we extend the application of these devices beyond characterization and demonstrate an instrument that generates complex and rapidly updateable ultrafast optical waveforms. We generate waveforms with 1.5-ps minimum features by compressing lower-bandwidth replicas created with a 10&#160;GHz electro-optic modulator. In effect, our device allows for ultrahigh-speed direct 270&#160;GHz modulation using relatively low speed devices and represents a new class of ultrafast waveform generators.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Mark A.

letter,Low-divergence single-mode terahertz quantum cascade laser,"<p>The operation of quantum cascade lasers has to date been demonstrated over a broad frequency range in the terahertz spectrum (from 4.4&#160;THz to 1.2&#160;THz). Most potential applications of terahertz quantum cascade lasers require a source that has an excellent spatial and spectral control of the radiated emission. Here, we present a distributed feedback design of a double-metal waveguide quantum cascade laser that features a grating resonant with the third-order Bragg condition. We show that an improvement of the extraction efficiency results in control of the laser emission wavelength and enhanced output power. Moreover, the grating can act as an array of phased linear sources, reshaping the typical wide and patterned far-field of double-metal waveguides into a narrow beam of &#8764;10&#176; divergence.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ETH Z\u00fcrich, Institute for Quantum Electronics, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 16, Z\u00fcrich, 8093, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""M.

letter,Far-ultraviolet plane-emission handheld device based on hexagonal boron nitride,"<p>Many researchers have been trying to produce highly efficient solid-state devices with longer operating lives for the far-ultraviolet wavelength region as an alternative to conventional far-ultraviolet lamps. However, owing to the low efficiency of far-ultraviolet operation, research continues into the development of far-ultraviolet devices with sufficiently high performance. Here, the potential of hexagonal boron nitride as a far-ultraviolet fluorescent material is studied. Specifically, taking advantage of the highly luminous properties of hexagonal boron nitride, a far-ultraviolet plane-emission compact device equipped with a field-emission array as an excitation source is fabricated, and its stable operation with an output power of 0.2&#160;mW at 225&#160;nm demonstrated. Because of its low current consumption in operation, the device can be driven by dry batteries. This convenient far-ultraviolet device is likely to prove extremely useful in photochemical and biotechnological applications such as photocatalysis, sterilization and modification of chemical substances.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute for Materials Science, Namiki 1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0044, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kenji Watanabe"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Takashi Taniguchi""]}, {""address"": ""Futaba Corporation, Yabutsuka 1080, Chosei-mura, Chosei-gun, Chiba, 299-4395, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takahiro Niiyama"", "",\u00a0Kenta Miya"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masateru Taniguchi""]}]",False,"[""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Takahiro Niiyama"", ""Kenta Miya"", ""Masateru Taniguchi""]","Watanabe, K., Taniguchi, T., Niiyama, T. et al.

article,Electrically tunable liquid crystal optical microresonators,"<p>Because of their small mode volume and high Q-factors, optical microresonators are interesting for applications such as laser sources, active filters and all-optical switches. Especially interesting are tunable resonators, in which the resonance frequency tuning by size, shape, temperature or electric field can be achieved. Here we demonstrate electrically tunable, low-loss whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonators made of nematic liquid crystal droplets, embedded in a polymer matrix. The shift in resonant frequencies is achieved via electric field-induced structural distortion of the birefringent liquid crystal resonator medium. Nematic liquid crystal microresonators have a large tuning range of the order of 20&#160;nm at 2.6&#160;V&#160;&#181;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for a &#8764;600 nm WGM in 17-&#181;m-diameter droplets and high Q-factors up to &#8764;12,000 in 33-&#181;m-diameter droplets.
