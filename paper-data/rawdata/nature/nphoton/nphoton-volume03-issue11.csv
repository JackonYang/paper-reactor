letter,A biological quarter-wave retarder with excellent achromaticity in the visible wavelength region,"<p>Animals make use of a wealth of optical physics to control and manipulate light, for example, in creating reflective animal colouration and polarized light signals. Their precise optics often surpass equivalent man-made optical devices in both sophistication and efficiency. Here, we report a biophysical mechanism that creates a natural full-visible-range achromatic quarter-wave retarder in the eye of a stomatopod crustacean. Analogous, man-made retardation devices are important optical components, used in both scientific research and commercial applications for controlling polarized light. Typical synthetic retarders are not achromatic, and more elaborate designs, such as, multilayer subwavelength gratings or bicrystalline constructions, only achieve partial wavelength independence. In this work, we use both experimental measurements and theoretical modelling of the photoreceptor structure to illustrate how a novel interplay of intrinsic and form birefringence results in a natural achromatic optic that significantly outperforms current man-made optical devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Photon Science Institute, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK"", ""authors"": [""N.

letter,Photon anti-bunching in acoustically pumped quantum dots,"<p>Although extensive research on nanostructures has led to the discovery of a number of efficient ways to confine carriers in reduced dimensions, little has been done to make use of the unique properties of various nanostructured systems through coupling by means of the controllable transfer of carriers between them. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach for the controllable transfer of electrons and holes between a semiconductor quantum well and an embedded quantum dot using the moving piezoelectric potential modulation induced by an acoustic phonon. We show that this moving potential not only transfers carriers between the quantum well and an array of quantum dots, but can also control their capture and recombination in discrete quantum dot states within the array. This feature is used to demonstrate a high-frequency, single-photon source with tunable emission energy by acoustically transferring carriers to a selected quantum dot.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Paul-Drude-Institut f\u00fcr Festk\u00f6rperelektronik, Hausvogteiplatz 5\u20137, Berlin, 10117, Germany"", ""authors"": [""O.

letter,Polymer solar cells with enhanced open-circuit voltage and efficiency,"<p>Following the development of the bulk heterojunction structure, recent years have seen a dramatic improvement in the efficiency of polymer solar cells. Maximizing the open-circuit voltage in a low-bandgap polymer is one of the critical factors towards enabling high-efficiency solar cells. Study of the relation between open-circuit voltage and the energy levels of the donor/acceptor in bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells has stimulated interest in modifying the open-circuit voltage by tuning the energy levels of polymers. Here, we show that the open-circuit voltage of polymer solar cells constructed based on the structure of a low-bandgap polymer, PBDTTT, can be tuned, step by step, using different functional groups, to achieve values as high as 0.76&#160;V. This increased open-circuit voltage combined with a high short-circuit current density results in a polymer solar cell with a power conversion efficiency as high as 6.77%, as certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Solarmer Energy Inc., El Monte, 91731, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hsiang-Yu Chen"", "",\u00a0Jianhui Hou"", "",\u00a0Shaoqing Zhang"", "",\u00a0Yue Wu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gang Li""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hsiang-Yu Chen"", "",\u00a0Guanwen Yang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yang Yang""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Chemistry and the James Franck Institute, The University of Chicago, 929 East 57th Street, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yongye Liang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Luping Yu""]}]",False,"[""Hsiang-Yu Chen"", ""Jianhui Hou"", ""Shaoqing Zhang"", ""Yongye Liang"", ""Guanwen Yang"", ""Yang Yang"", ""Luping Yu"", ""Yue Wu"", ""Gang Li""]","Chen, H., Hou, J., Zhang, S. et al.

letter,Large single-molecule fluorescence enhancements produced by a bowtie nanoantenna,"<p>Owing to the size mismatch between light and nanoscale objects such as single molecules, it is important to be able to control light&#8211;molecule interactions. Plasmonic nanoantennas create highly enhanced local fields when pumped resonantly, leading to increased Raman scattering, but whether fluorescence enhancement occurs depends upon a variety of factors. Although sharp metal tips and colloids can enhance fluorescence, the highly enhanced optical fields of lithographically fabricated bowtie nanoantennas provide a structure that is more controllable and amenable to integration. Using gold bowties, we observe enhancements of a single molecule's fluorescence up to a factor of 1,340, ten times higher than reported previously. Electromagnetic simulations reveal that this is a result of greatly enhanced absorption and an increased radiative emission rate, leading to enhancement of the intrinsic quantum efficiency by an estimated factor of nine, despite additional non-radiative ohmic effects. Bowtie nanoantennas thus show great potential for high-contrast selection of single nanoemitters.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Anika Kinkhabwala"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0W.

letter,Optical antenna thermal emitters,"<p>Optical antennas are a critical component in nanophotonics research and have been used to enhance nonlinear and Raman cross-sections and to make nanoscale optical probes. In addition to their &#8216;receiving&#8217; properties, optical antennas can operate in &#8216;broadcasting&#8217; mode, and have been used to modify the emission rate and direction of individual molecules. In these applications the antenna must operate at frequencies given by existing light emitters. Using thermal excitation of optical antennas, we bypass this limitation and realize emitters at infrared frequencies where sources are less readily available. Specifically, we show that the thermal emission from a single SiC whisker antenna is attributable to well-defined, size-tunable Mie resonances. Furthermore, we derive a fundamental limit on the antenna emittance and argue theoretically that these structures are nearly ideal black-body antennas. Combined with advancing progress in antenna design, these results could lead to optical antenna emitters operating throughout the infrared frequency range.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Geballe Lab for Advanced Materials, Stanford University, Stanford, 94306, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jon A.

letter,Exciton-lattice polaritons in multiple-quantum-well-based photonic crystals,"<p>Coherent interaction of an ensemble of dipole active atoms or excitons with a vacuum electromagnetic field has been studied extensively since its initial conception by Dicke in 1954. However, when the emitters are not only periodically arranged as in refs 2 to 4, but are also placed in a periodically modulated dielectric environment, the interaction between them is carried by the electromagnetic Bloch waves of the photonic crystal. Here we report the first observation of this effect using a periodic arrangement of GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells. The formation of coherently coupled photonic-crystal excitonic-lattice polaritons manifests in our experiments through enhanced reflectivity and reconstruction of the photonic bandgap in the vicinity of the excitons. Experimental evidence of hybrid light hole&#8211;heavy hole excitonic-lattice polaritons is also presented. Coherent coupling between excitons and Bloch waves is established through comparisons of the experimental results with theory. Finally, we demonstrate the tuning of these polariton states by an electric field.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Queens College of the City University of New York (CUNY) Flushing, 11367, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""David Goldberg"", "",\u00a0Lev I.
