letter,Terahertz amplifier based on gain switching in a quantum cascade laser,"<p>Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy is widely used in a broad range of applications where knowledge of both the amplitude and phase of a terahertz wave can reveal useful information about a sample. However, a means of amplifying terahertz pulses, which would be of great benefit in improving the applicability of time-domain spectroscopy, is lacking. Although terahertz quantum cascade lasers are promising devices for terahertz amplification, gain clamping limits the attainable amplification. Here, we circumvent gain clamping and demonstrate amplification of terahertz pulses by ultrafast gain switching of a quantum cascade laser through the use of an integrated Auston switch. This unclamps the gain by placing the laser in a non-equilibrium state that allows large amplification of the electromagnetic field within the cavity. This technique offers the potential to produce high field terahertz pulses that approach the quantum cascade laser saturation field.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Pierre Aigrain, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, UMR 8551 CNRS, UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 6, Paris, 75005, France"", ""authors"": [""Nathan Jukam"", "",\u00a0Sukhdeep S.

letter,Optimal quantum cloning of orbital angular momentum photon qubits through Hong–Ou–Mandel coalescence,"<p>The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, associated with a helical structure of the wavefunction, has great potential in quantum photonics, as it allows a higher dimensional quantum space to be attached to each photon. Hitherto, however, the use of OAM has been hindered by difficulties in its manipulation. Here, by making use of the recently demonstrated spin-OAM information transfer tools, we report the first observation of the Hong&#8211;Ou&#8211;Mandel coalescence of two incoming photons having non-zero OAM into the same outgoing mode of a beamsplitter. The coalescence can be switched on and off by varying the input OAM state of the photons. Such an effect has then been used to carry out the 1&#160;&#8594;&#160;2 universal optimal quantum cloning of OAM-encoded qubits, using the symmetrization technique already developed for polarization. These results are shown to be scalable to quantum spaces of arbitrary dimensions, even combining different degrees of freedom of the photons.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Roma, 00185, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Eleonora Nagali"", "",\u00a0Linda Sansoni"", "",\u00a0Fabio Sciarrino"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Francesco De Martini""]}, {""address"": ""Istituto Nazionale di Ottica Applicata, Firenze, 50125, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Fabio Sciarrino""]}, {""address"": ""Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, via della Lungara 10, Roma, 00165, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Francesco De Martini""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche, Universit\u00e1 di Napoli \u2018Federico II\u2019, Compl.

letter,Non-resonant dot–cavity coupling and its potential for resonant single-quantum-dot spectroscopy,"<p>Non-resonant emitter&#8211;cavity coupling is a fascinating effect recently observed as unexpected pronounced cavity resonance emission even in strongly detuned single quantum dot&#8211;microcavity systems. This phenomenon indicates strong, complex light&#8211;matter interactions in these solid-state systems, and has major implications for single-photon sources and quantum information applications. We study non-resonant dot&#8211;cavity coupling of individual quantum dots in micropillars under resonant excitation, revealing a pronounced effect over positive and negative quantum dot mode detunings. Our results suggest a dominant role of phonon-mediated dephasing in dot&#8211;cavity coupling, giving a new perspective to the controversial discussions ongoing in the literature. Such enhanced insight is essential for various cavity-based quantum electrodynamic systems using emitters that experience phonon coupling, such as colour centres in diamond and colloidal nanocrystals. Non-resonant coupling is demonstrated to be a versatile &#8216;monitoring&#8217; tool for observing relevant quantum dot s-shell emission properties and background-free photon statistics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Halbleiteroptik und Funktionelle Grenzfl\u00e4chen, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Allmandring 3, Stuttgart, 70569, Germany"", ""authors"": [""S.

letter,A passively mode-locked external-cavity semiconductor laser emitting 60-fs pulses,"<p>Optical pulses with durations of a few tens of femtoseconds are used to drive applications ranging from attoscience to metrology, but femtosecond lasers remain bulky and expensive items based on vibronic crystal or ytterbium-doped silica fibre gain media. Although, in principle, bandgap-engineered quantum-confined semiconductor materials have significant advantages in terms of their gain bandwidth and spectral versatility, semiconductor lasers have not, to date, been capable of generating comparably short pulses. Here, we describe an optically pumped InGaAs/GaAs quantum-well laser that is passively mode-locked using an intracavity semiconductor saturable absorber mirror that emits 60-fs pulses at 1,037&#160;nm with an optical spectrum bandwidth of 20&#160;nm (full-width at half-maximum). In this laser, fast optical Stark self-absorption modulation and strong gain saturation combine to shape pulses on the timescale of carrier&#8211;carrier scattering. The cavity contains a stable group of circulating pulses, regularly spaced at an interval fixed by the time over which the saturated gain recovers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK"", ""authors"": [""Adrian H.

article,Tuning a terahertz wire laser,"<p>Tunable terahertz lasers are desirable in applications in sensing and spectroscopy because many biochemical species have strong spectral fingerprints at terahertz frequencies. Conventionally, the frequency of a laser is tuned in a similar manner to a stringed musical instrument, in which pitch is varied by changing the length of the string (the longitudinal component of the wave vector) and/or its tension (the refractive index). However, such methods are difficult to implement in terahertz semiconductor lasers because of their poor outcoupling efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate a novel tuning mechanism based on a unique &#8216;wire laser&#8217; device for which the transverse dimension w is &#8810;&#955;. Placing a movable object close to the wire laser manipulates a large fraction of the waveguided mode propagating outside the cavity, thereby tuning its resonant frequency. Continuous single-mode redshift and blueshift tuning is demonstrated for the same device by using either a dielectric or metallic movable object. In combination, this enables a frequency tuning of &#8764;137 GHz (3.6%) from a single laser device at &#8764;3.8 THz.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Qi Qin"", "",\u00a0Benjamin S.
