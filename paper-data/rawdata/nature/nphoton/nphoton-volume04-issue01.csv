letter,Synthesis of a single cycle of light with compact erbium-doped fibre technology,"<p>The advent of self-referenced optical frequency combs has sparked the development of novel areas in ultrafast sciences such as attosecond technology and the synthesis of arbitrary optical waveforms. Few-cycle light pulses are key to these time-domain applications, driving a quest for reliable, stable and cost-efficient mode-locked laser sources with ultrahigh spectral bandwidth. Here, we present a set-up based entirely on compact erbium-doped fibre technology, which produces single cycles of light. The pulse duration of 4.3&#160;fs is close to the shortest possible value for a data bit of information transmitted in the near-infrared regime. These results demonstrate that fundamental limits for optical telecommunications are accessible with existing fibre technology and standard free-space components.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Center for Applied Photonics, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, D-78464, Germany"", ""authors"": [""G\u00fcnther Krauss"", "",\u00a0Sebastian Lohss"", "",\u00a0Tobias Hanke"", "",\u00a0Alexander Sell"", "",\u00a0Stefan Eggert"", "",\u00a0Rupert Huber"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Alfred Leitenstorfer""]}]",False,"[""G\u00fcnther Krauss"", ""Sebastian Lohss"", ""Tobias Hanke"", ""Alexander Sell"", ""Stefan Eggert"", ""Rupert Huber"", ""Alfred Leitenstorfer""]","Krauss, G., Lohss, S., Hanke, T. et al.

letter,CMOS-compatible multiple-wavelength oscillator for on-chip optical interconnects,"<p>Silicon photonics enables the fabrication of on-chip, ultrahigh-bandwidth optical networks that are critical for the future of microelectronics. Several optical components necessary for implementing a wavelength division multiplexing network have been demonstrated in silicon. However, a fully integrated multiple-wavelength source capable of driving such a network has not yet been realized. Optical amplification, a necessary component for lasing, has been achieved on-chip through stimulated Raman scattering, parametric mixing and by silicon nanocrystals or nanopatterned silicon. Losses in most of these structures have prevented oscillation. Raman oscillators have been demonstrated, but with a narrow gain bandwidth that is insufficient for wavelength division multiplexing. Here, we demonstrate the first monolithically integrated CMOS-compatible source by creating an optical parametric oscillator formed by a silicon nitride ring resonator on silicon. The device can generate more than 100 new wavelengths with operating powers below 50&#160;mW. This source can form the backbone of a high-bandwidth optical network on a microelectronic chip.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jacob S.

However, for applications in telecommunications and optical interconnects, analogous devices compatible with a fully integrated platform do not yet exist. Here, we report a fully integrated, CMOS-compatible, multiple-wavelength source. We achieve optical &#8216;hyper-parametric&#8217; oscillation in a high-index silica-glass microring resonator with a differential slope efficiency above threshold of 7.4% for a single oscillating mode, a continuous-wave threshold power as low as 54&#160;mW, and a controllable range of frequency spacing from 200&#160;GHz to more than 6&#160;THz.

letter,On-chip single nanoparticle detection and sizing by mode splitting in an ultrahigh-Q microresonator,"<p>The ability to detect and size individual nanoparticles with high resolution is crucial to understanding the behaviour of single particles and effectively using their strong size-dependent properties to develop innovative products. We report real-time, in situ detection and sizing of single nanoparticles, down to 30&#160;nm in radius, using mode splitting in a monolithic ultrahigh-quality-factor (Q) whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. Particle binding splits a whispering-gallery mode into two spectrally shifted resonance modes, forming a self-referenced detection scheme. This technique provides superior noise suppression and enables the extraction of accurate particle size information with a single-shot measurement in a microscale device.

letter,Generation of molecular hot electroluminescence by resonant nanocavity plasmons,"<p>Control of the radiative properties of functional molecules near metals is a key issue in nano-optics, and is particularly important in the fields of energy transfer and light manipulation at the nanoscale and the development of plasmonic devices. Despite the various vibronic transitions (S<sub>1</sub>(v&#8242;)&#160;&#8594;&#160;S<sub>0</sub>(v)) available for frequency tuning of fluorescence, the molecular emissions near metals reported to date have been subject to Kasha's rule, with radiative decay from the lowest excited state (S<sub>1</sub>(0)) (refs&#160;&#8211;). Here, we show resonant hot electroluminescence arising directly from higher vibronic levels of the singlet excited state (S<sub>1</sub>(v&#8242;&#160;&gt;&#160;0)) for porphyrin molecules confined inside a nanocavity in a scanning tunnelling microscope, by spectrally tuning the frequency of plasmons. We also demonstrate the generation of unexpected upconversion electroluminescence. These observations suggest that the local nanocavity plasmons behave like a strong coherent optical source with tunable energy, and can be used to actively control the radiative channels of molecular emitters by means of intense resonance enhancement of both excitation and emission.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Z.

letter,Cavity-enhanced dual-comb spectroscopy,"<p>The sensitivity of molecular fingerprinting is dramatically improved when the absorbing sample is placed in a high-finesse optical cavity, because the effective path length is increased. When the equidistant lines from a laser frequency comb are simultaneously injected into the cavity over a large spectral range, multiple trace gases may be identified within a few milliseconds. However, efficient analysis of the light transmitted through the cavity remains challenging. Here, a novel approach&#8212;cavity-enhanced, frequency-comb, Fourier-transform spectroscopy&#8212;fully overcomes this difficulty and enables measurement of ultrasensitive, broad-bandwidth, high-resolution spectra within a few tens of microseconds without any need for detector arrays, potentially from the terahertz to ultraviolet regions.

article,An optical ultrafast random bit generator,"<p>The generation of random bit sequences based on non-deterministic physical mechanisms is of paramount importance for cryptography and secure communications. High data rates also require extremely fast generation rates and robustness to external perturbations. Physical generators based on stochastic noise sources have been limited in bandwidth to &#8764;100 Mbit s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> generation rates. We present a physical random bit generator, based on a chaotic semiconductor laser, having time-delayed self-feedback, which operates reliably at rates up to 300&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The method uses a high derivative of the digitized chaotic laser intensity and generates the random sequence by retaining a number of the least significant bits of the high derivative value. The method is insensitive to laser operational parameters and eliminates the necessity for all external constraints such as incommensurate sampling rates and laser external cavity round trip time. The randomness of long bit strings is verified by standard statistical tests.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Minerva Center and Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 52900, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Ido Kanter""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, The Jack and Pearl Resnick Institute for Advanced Technology, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 52900, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Yaara Aviad"", "",\u00a0Igor Reidler"", "",\u00a0Elad Cohen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Michael Rosenbluh""]}]",False,"[""Ido Kanter"", ""Yaara Aviad"", ""Igor Reidler"", ""Elad Cohen"", ""Michael Rosenbluh""]","Kanter, I., Aviad, Y., Reidler, I. et al.
