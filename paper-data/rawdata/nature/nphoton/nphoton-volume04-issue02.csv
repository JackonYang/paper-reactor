review article,Plasmonics beyond the diffraction limit,"<p>Recent years have seen a rapid expansion of research into nanophotonics based on surface plasmon&#8211;polaritons. These electromagnetic waves propagate along metal&#8211;dielectric interfaces and can be guided by metallic nanostructures beyond the diffraction limit. This remarkable capability has unique prospects for the design of highly integrated photonic signal-processing systems, nanoresolution optical imaging techniques and sensors. This Review summarizes the basic principles and major achievements of plasmon guiding, and details the current state-of-the-art in subwavelength plasmonic waveguides, passive and active nanoplasmonic components for the generation, manipulation and detection of radiation, and configurations for the nanofocusing of light. Potential future developments and applications of nanophotonic devices and circuits are also discussed, such as in optical signals processing, nanoscale optical devices and near-field microscopy with nanoscale resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nanophotonics, GPO Box 786, Brisbane, 4035, Queensland, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Dmitri K.

letter,A matterless double slit,"<p>Double slits provide incoming particles with a choice. Those that survive passage through the slits have chosen from two possible paths, which interfere to distribute them in a wave-like manner. Such wave&#8211;particle duality continues to be challenged and investigated in a broad range of disciplines with electrons, neutrons, helium atoms, C<sub>60</sub> fullerenes, Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates and biological molecules. All variants have hitherto involved material constituents. We present a matterless double-slit scenario in which photons generated from virtual electron&#8211;positron pair annihilation in head-on collisions of a probe laser field with two ultra-intense laser beams form a double-slit interference pattern. Such electromagnetic fields are predicted to induce material-like behaviour in vacuum, supporting elastic scattering between photons.

letter,Highly power-efficient quantum cascade lasers,"<p>Quantum cascade lasers are promising mid-infrared semiconductor light sources for molecular detection in applications such as environmental sensing or medical diagnostics. For such applications, researchers have been striving to improve device performance. Recently, improvements in wall plug efficiency have been pursued with a view to realizing compact, portable, power-efficient and high-power quantum cascade laser systems. However, advances have largely been incremental, and the basic quantum design has remained unchanged for many years, with the wall plug efficiency yet to reach above 35%. A crucial factor in quantum cascade laser performance is the efficient transport of electrons into the laser active regions. We recently theoretically described this transport process as limited by the interface-roughness-induced detuning of resonant tunnelling. Here, we report that an &#8216;ultrastrong coupling&#8217; design strategy overcomes this limiting factor and leads to the experimental realization of quantum cascade lasers with 40&#8211;50% wall plug efficiency when operated in pulsed mode at temperatures of 160&#160;K or lower.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Peter Q.

letter,Quantum cascade lasers that emit more light than heat,"<p>For any semiconductor lasers, the wall plug efficiency, that is, the portion of the injected electrical energy that can be converted into output optical energy, is one of the most important figures of merit. A device with a higher wall plug efficiency has a lower power demand and prolonged device lifetime due to its reduced self-heating. Since its invention, the power performance of the quantum cascade laser has improved tremendously. However, although the internal quantum efficiency can be engineered to be greater than 80% at low temperatures, the wall plug efficiency of a quantum cascade laser has never been demonstrated above 50% at any temperature. The best wall plug efficiency reported to date is 36% at 120&#160;K (ref.&#160;). Here, we overcome the limiting factors using a single-well injector design and demonstrate 53% wall plug efficiency at 40&#160;K with an emitting wavelength of 5&#160;&#181;m. In other words, we demonstrate a quantum cascade laser that produces more light than heat.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Center for Quantum Devices, Northwestern University, Evanston, 60208, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yanbo Bai"", "",\u00a0Steven Slivken"", "",\u00a0Shigeyuki Kuboya"", "",\u00a0Shaban R.

letter,Airy–Bessel wave packets as versatile linear light bullets,"<p>The generation of spatiotemporal optical wave packets that are impervious to both dispersion and diffraction has been a fascinating challenge. Despite intense research activity, such localized waves, referred to as light bullets, have remained elusive. In nonlinear propagation, three-dimensional light bullets tend to disintegrate as a result of inherent instabilities. Three-dimensional wave packets that propagate linearly have been reported, but their utility is severely limited by the need to tailor the wave packet precisely to material properties. To overcome these limitations, we explore a new approach based on the one-dimensional Airy wave packet. Here, we report the first observation of a class of versatile three-dimensional linear light bullets, which combine Bessel beams in the transverse plane with temporal Airy pulses. Their evolution does not depend critically on the material in which they propagate, and the consequent versatility will facilitate their study and applications ranging from bioimaging to plasma physics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Andy Chong"", "",\u00a0William H.

letter,Active magneto-plasmonics in hybrid metal–ferromagnet structures,"<p>Surface-plasmon-mediated confinement of optical fields holds great promise for on-chip miniaturization of all-optical circuits. Following successful demonstrations of passive nanoplasmonic devices, active plasmonic systems have been designed to control plasmon propagation. This goal has been achieved either by coupling plasmons to optically active materials or by making use of transient optical nonlinearities in metals via strong excitation with ultrashort laser pulses. Here, we present a new concept in which the active optical component is a metal&#8211;ferromagnet&#8211;metal structure. It is based on active magneto-plasmonic microinterferometry, where the surface plasmon wave vector in a gold&#8211;ferromagnet&#8211;gold trilayer system is controlled using a weak external magnetic field. Application of this new technique allows measurement of the electromagnetic field distribution inside a metal at optical frequencies and with nanometre depth resolution. Significant modulation depth combined with possible all-optical magnetization reversal induced by femtosecond light pulses opens a route to ultrafast magneto-plasmonic switching.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Vasily V.

article,Ultrabroad-bandwidth arbitrary radiofrequency waveform generation with a silicon photonic chip-based spectral shaper,"<p>Ultrabroad-bandwidth radiofrequency pulses offer significant applications potential, such as increased data transmission rate and multipath tolerance in wireless communications. Such ultrabroad-bandwidth pulses are inherently difficult to generate with chip-based electronics due to limits in digital-to-analog converter technology and high timing jitter. Photonic means of radiofrequency waveform generation, for example, by spectral shaping and frequency&#8211;time mapping, can overcome the bandwidth limit in electronic generation. However, previous bulk optic systems for radiofrequency arbitrary waveform generation do not offer the integration advantage of electronics. Here, we report a chip-scale, fully programmable spectral shaper consisting of cascaded multiple-channel microring resonators, on a silicon photonics platform that is compatible with electronic integrated circuit technology. Using such a spectral shaper, we demonstrate the generation of burst radiofrequency waveforms with programmable time-dependent amplitude, frequency and phase profiles, for frequencies up to 60&#160;GHz.
