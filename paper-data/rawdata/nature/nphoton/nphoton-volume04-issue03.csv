letter,Laser cooling of solids to cryogenic temperatures,"<p>Laser radiation has been used to cool matter ranging from dilute gases to micromechanical oscillators. In Doppler cooling of gases, the translational energy of atoms is lowered through interaction with a laser field. Recently, cooling of a high-density gas through collisional redistribution of radiation has been demonstrated. In laser cooling of solids, heat is removed through the annihilation of lattice vibrations in the process of anti-Stokes fluorescence. Since its initial observation in 1995, research has led to achieving a temperature of 208&#160;K in ytterbium-doped glass. In this Letter, we report laser cooling of ytterbium-doped LiYF<sub>4</sub> crystal to a temperature of &#8764;155 K starting from ambient, with a cooling power of 90 mW. This is achieved by making use of the Stark manifold resonance in a crystalline host, and demonstrates the lowest temperature achieved to date without the use of cryogens or mechanical refrigeration. Optical refrigeration has entered the cryogenic regime, surpassing the performance of multi-stage Peltier coolers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physics and Astronomy Department, University of New Mexico, 800 Yale Boulevard NE, Albuquerque, 87131, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""Denis V.

letter,Quasi-periodic distributed feedback laser,"<p>Although lasers have found numerous applications, their design is often still based on the concept of a gain medium within a mirror cavity. Exceptions to this are distributed feedback lasers, in which feedback develops along a periodic structure, or random lasers, which do not require any form of cavity. Random lasers have very rich emission spectra, but are difficult to control. Distributed feedback devices, conversely, have the same limited design possibilities of regular lasers. We show, by making use of a quasi-crystalline structure in an electrically pumped device, that several advantages of a random laser can be combined with the predictability of a distributed feedback resonator. We have constructed a terahertz quantum cascade laser based on a Fibonacci distributed feedback sequence, and show that engineering of the self-similar spectrum of the grating allows features beyond those possible with traditional periodic resonators, such as directional output independent of the emission frequency and multicolour operation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NEST, CNR-INFM and Scuola Normale Superiore, Piazza dei Cavalieri 7, Pisa, I-56126, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Lukas Mahler"", "",\u00a0Alessandro Tredicucci"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Fabio Beltram""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Electronics, ETH Zurich, HPT H 7, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 16, Zurich, CH-8093, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Christoph Walther"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0J\u00e9r\u00f4me Faist""]}, {""address"": ""Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, J J Thomson Avenue, Cambridge, CB3 0HE, United Kingdom"", ""authors"": [""Harvey E.

letter,Ultraviolet enhancement cavity for ultrafast nonlinear optics and high-rate multiphoton entanglement experiments,"<p>Ultrafast, ultraviolet light pulses are a key tool for spectroscopic studies (for example, molecular formation and carrier dynamics in semiconductors) as well as a source for non-classical states of light. The power required for many nonlinear processes makes amplifier systems mandatory, which significantly reduces the available repetition rate and thus often lengthens the experimental acquisition time. Here we adopt techniques recently developed for the infrared regime to design the first enhancement cavity for femtosecond ultraviolet pulses. An average ultraviolet power of more than 7&#160;W at a repetition rate of 81&#160;MHz is now available to pump a nonlinear crystal inside the cavity, applied here to implement a powerful source for high-rate experiments with entangled multiphoton states. The field enhancement enables a new scale of experiments in photonic quantum logic and in nonlinear optics research, for example, to operate optical parametric amplifiers at high repetition rates or to create high-harmonic-frequency combs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Garching, D-85748, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Roland Krischek"", "",\u00a0Witlef Wieczorek"", "",\u00a0Akira Ozawa"", "",\u00a0Nikolai Kiesel"", "",\u00a0Patrick Michelberger"", "",\u00a0Thomas Udem"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Harald Weinfurter""]}, {""address"": ""Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Physik, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, M\u00fcnchen, D-80799, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Roland Krischek"", "",\u00a0Witlef Wieczorek"", "",\u00a0Nikolai Kiesel"", "",\u00a0Patrick Michelberger"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Harald Weinfurter""]}]",False,"[""Roland Krischek"", ""Witlef Wieczorek"", ""Akira Ozawa"", ""Nikolai Kiesel"", ""Patrick Michelberger"", ""Thomas Udem"", ""Harald Weinfurter""]","Krischek, R., Wieczorek, W., Ozawa, A. et al.

letter,A highly efficient single-photon source based on a quantum dot in a photonic nanowire,"<p>The development of efficient solid-state sources of single photons is a major challenge in the context of quantum communication, optical quantum information processing and metrology. Such a source must enable the implementation of a stable, single-photon emitter, like a colour centre in diamond or a semiconductor quantum dot. Achieving a high extraction efficiency has long been recognized as a major issue, and both classical solutions and cavity quantum electrodynamics effects have been applied. We adopt a different approach, based on an InAs quantum dot embedded in a GaAs photonic nanowire with carefully tailored ends. Under optical pumping, we demonstrate a record source efficiency of 0.72, combined with pure single-photon emission. This non-resonant approach also provides broadband spontaneous emission control, thus offering appealing novel opportunities for the development of single-photon sources based on spectrally broad emitters, wavelength-tunable sources or efficient sources of entangled photon pairs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CEA-CNRS-UJF group \u2018Nanophysique et Semiconducteurs\u2019, CEA, INAC, SP2M, Grenoble, F-38054, France"", ""authors"": [""Julien Claudon"", "",\u00a0Jo\u00ebl Bleuse"", "",\u00a0Nitin Singh Malik"", "",\u00a0Maela Bazin"", "",\u00a0P\u00e9rine Jaffrennou"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jean-Michel G\u00e9rard""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Photonics Engineering, DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Building 343, DK-2800 Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"", ""authors"": [""Niels Gregersen""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratoire Charles Fabry de l'Institut d'Optique, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Campus Polytechnique, RD 128, Palaiseau, 91127, France"", ""authors"": [""Christophe Sauvan"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Philippe Lalanne""]}]",False,"[""Julien Claudon"", ""Jo\u00ebl Bleuse"", ""Nitin Singh Malik"", ""Maela Bazin"", ""P\u00e9rine Jaffrennou"", ""Niels Gregersen"", ""Christophe Sauvan"", ""Philippe Lalanne"", ""Jean-Michel G\u00e9rard""]","Claudon, J., Bleuse, J., Malik, N. et al.A highly efficient single-photon source based on a quantum dot in a photonic nanowire.

letter,Entanglement distillation from Gaussian input states,"<p>Entanglement distillation is an essential protocol for long-distance quantum communications, typically for extending the range of quantum key distribution. In the field of continuous variable quantum information processing, quantum as well as classical information is encoded in the light field quadratures, often in the form of Gaussian states. However, distillation from Gaussian input states has not yet been accomplished. It is made difficult by a prominent no-go theorem stating that no Gaussian operation can distill Gaussian states. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, such distillation from Gaussian input states, realized by the implementation of non-Gaussian operations. By subtracting one or two photons, a large gain of entanglement was observed. For two photons, Gaussian-like entanglement was also improved. Other than quantum key distribution, this distilled entanglement can also be used for downstream applications such as high-fidelity quantum teleportation and a loophole-free Bell test.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), 4-2-1 Nukui-kitamachi, Koganei, Tokyo, 184-8795, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Hiroki Takahashi"", "",\u00a0Jonas S.

article,"An ultra-small, low-power, all-optical flip-flop memory on a silicon chip","<p>Ultra-small, low-power, all-optical switching and memory elements, such as all-optical flip-flops, as well as photonic integrated circuits of many such elements, are in great demand for all-optical signal buffering, switching and processing. Silicon-on-insulator is considered to be a promising platform to accommodate such photonic circuits in large-scale configurations. Through heterogeneous integration of InP membranes onto silicon-on-insulator, a single microdisk laser with a diameter of 7.5&#160;&#181;m, coupled to a silicon-on-insulator wire waveguide, is demonstrated here as an all-optical flip-flop working in a continuous-wave regime with an electrical power consumption of a few milliwatts, allowing switching in 60&#160;ps with 1.8&#160;fJ optical energy. The total power consumption and the device size are, to the best of our knowledge, the smallest reported to date at telecom wavelengths. This is also the only electrically pumped, all-optical flip-flop on silicon built upon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""INTEC Department, Photonics Research Group, Ghent University\u2013IMEC, Gent, B-9000, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Liu Liu"", "",\u00a0Rajesh Kumar"", "",\u00a0Koen Huybrechts"", "",\u00a0Thijs Spuesens"", "",\u00a0G\u00fcnther Roelkens"", "",\u00a0Dries Van Thourhout"", "",\u00a0Roel Baets"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Geert Morthier""]}, {""address"": ""COBRA Research Institute, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Postbus 513, Eindhoven, 5600, MB, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Erik-Jan Geluk"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tjibbe de Vries""]}, {""address"": ""Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon INL-UMR5270, CNRS, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Ecully, F-69134, France"", ""authors"": [""Philippe Regreny""]}]",False,"[""Liu Liu"", ""Rajesh Kumar"", ""Koen Huybrechts"", ""Thijs Spuesens"", ""G\u00fcnther Roelkens"", ""Erik-Jan Geluk"", ""Tjibbe de Vries"", ""Philippe Regreny"", ""Dries Van Thourhout"", ""Roel Baets"", ""Geert Morthier""]","Liu, L., Kumar, R., Huybrechts, K. et al.

article,Aperiodic volume optics,"<p>Volumetric integrated optical micro- and nanosystems are becoming the new frontier in photonics. Fine control over the material structure within a volume enables novel physical phenomena and previously unthinkable design freedom for spatial, spectral and temporal functions. For instance, materials have been tailored to control light through the use of metamaterials, disordered media and photonic crystals. Although periodic structures have been thoroughly investigated, volumetric aperiodic structures remain largely unexplored. The design of higher dimensional structures is of interest for controlling the multidimensional coherence function (which describes light fields) through diffraction, refraction, radiation and scattering. This report presents a three-dimensional scattering approach to the design of aperiodic volume optical elements and explores new functionalities making use of the now available three-dimensional degrees of freedom. Aperiodic volume elements that multiplex spatial and spectral information are numerically designed and experimentally demonstrated for the first time, hence expanding the traditional capabilities of volume holography, photonic crystals and diffractive optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, 80309-0425, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tim D.
