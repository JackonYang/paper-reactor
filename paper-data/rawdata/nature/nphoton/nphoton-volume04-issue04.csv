review article,Optomechanical device actuation through the optical gradient force,"<p>Optical forces are widely used to manipulate microparticles such as living cells, DNA and bacteria. The forces used in these 'optical tweezers' originate from the strongly varying electromagnetic field in the focus of a high-power laser beam. This field gradient polarizes the particle, causing the positively and negatively charged sides of the dipole to experience slightly different forces. It was recently realized that the strong field gradient in the near-field of guided wave structures can also be exploited for actuating optomechanical devices, and initial theoretical work in this area was followed rapidly by several experimental demonstrations. This Review summarizes the rapid development in this field. First, the origin of the optical gradient force is discussed in detail. Several experimental demonstrations and approaches for enhancing the strength of the effect are then discussed. Finally, some of the possible applications of the effect are reviewed.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Information Technology, Ghent University-IMEC, St. Pietersnieuwstraat 41, 9000, Gent, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Dries Van Thourhout"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Joris Roels""]}]",False,"[""Dries Van Thourhout"", ""Joris Roels""]","Van Thourhout, D., Roels, J.

letter,Towards high-speed optical quantum memories,"<p>Quantum memories, capable of controllably storing and releasing a photon, are a crucial component for quantum computers and quantum communications. To date, quantum memories have operated with bandwidths that limit data rates to megahertz. Here we report the coherent storage and retrieval of sub-nanosecond low-intensity light pulses with spectral bandwidths exceeding 1&#160;GHz in caesium vapour. The novel memory interaction takes place through a far off-resonant two-photon transition in which the memory bandwidth is dynamically generated by a strong control field. This should allow data rates more than 100 times greater than those of existing quantum memories. The memory works with a total efficiency of 15%, and its coherence is demonstrated through direct interference of the stored and retrieved pulses. Coherence times in hot atomic vapours are on the order of microseconds, the expected storage time limit for this memory.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK"", ""authors"": [""K.

letter,Light extraction from organic light-emitting diodes enhanced by spontaneously formed buckles,"<p>Most of the light in conventional organic light-emitting diodes is confined to high-refractive-index layers (such as an organic medium, indium tin oxide and glass substrate) resulting in a low light extraction efficiency of &#8764;20% (refs 1,2). Many studies have used wavelength-scale periodic gratings to increase the external efficiency of organic light-emitting diodes. However, the efficiency is only enhanced at particular wavelengths satisfying the Bragg condition. Here, we demonstrate that a quasi-periodic buckling structure with broad distribution and directional randomness can enhance the light extraction efficiency without introducing spectral changes and directionality. Organic light-emitting diodes corrugated by buckles showed improved current and power efficiencies and an electroluminescence spectrum enhanced by at least a factor of two across the entire visible wavelength regime. These buckling patterns are formed spontaneously on elastic materials with a thin metallic film. The buckled organic light-emitting diode devices are practical and attractive for use in fabricating full colour and white organic light-emitting diodes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Organic and Polymeric Materials, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 O-okayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 152-8552, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Won Hoe Koo"", "",\u00a0Fumito Araoka"", "",\u00a0Ken Ishikawa"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hideo Takezoe""]}, {""address"": ""Nippon Oil Corporation, Central Technical Research Laboratory, 8 Chidori-cho, Naka-ku, Yokohama, 231-0815, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Soon Moon Jeong"", "",\u00a0Suzushi Nishimura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Takehiro Toyooka""]}]",False,"[""Won Hoe Koo"", ""Soon Moon Jeong"", ""Fumito Araoka"", ""Ken Ishikawa"", ""Suzushi Nishimura"", ""Takehiro Toyooka"", ""Hideo Takezoe""]","Koo, W., Jeong, S., Araoka, F. et al.

letter,Experimental realization of sub-shot-noise quantum imaging,"<p>The properties of quantum states have led to the development of new technologies, ranging from quantum information to quantum metrology. A recent field of research to emerge is quantum imaging, which aims to overcome the limits of classical imaging by making use of the spatial properties of quantum states of light . In particular, quantum correlations between twin beams represent a fundamental resource for these studies. One of the most interesting proposed schemes takes advantage of the spatial quantum correlations between parametric down-conversion light beams to realize sub-shot-noise imaging of weak absorbing objects, leading ideally to noise-free imaging. Here, we present the first experimental realization of this scheme, showing its potential to achieve a larger signal-to-noise ratio than classical imaging methods. This work represents the starting point for this quantum technology, which we anticipate will have applications when there is a requirement for low-photon-flux illumination (for example for use with biological samples).</p>",,"[{""address"": ""INRIM, strada delle Cacce 91, Torino, 10135, Italy"", ""authors"": [""G.

article,Random distributed feedback fibre laser,"<p>The concept of random lasers making use of multiple scattering in amplifying disordered media to generate coherent light has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. Here, we demonstrate a fibre laser with a mirrorless open cavity that operates via Rayleigh scattering, amplified through the Raman effect. The fibre waveguide geometry provides transverse confinement and effectively one-dimensional random distributed feedback, leading to the generation of a stationary near-Gaussian beam with a narrow spectrum, and with efficiency and performance comparable to regular lasers. Rayleigh scattering due to inhomogeneities within the glass structure of the fibre is extremely weak, making the operation and properties of the proposed random distributed feedback lasers profoundly different from those of both traditional random lasers and conventional fibre lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Photonics Research Group, Aston University, Birmingham, B4 7ET, UK"", ""authors"": [""Sergei K.

article,Coherent mixing of mechanical excitations in nano-optomechanical structures,"<p>The combination of the large per-photon optical force and small motional mass achievable in nanocavity optomechanical systems results in strong dynamical back-action between mechanical motion and the cavity light field. In this Article, we study the optical control of mechanical motion within two different nanocavity structures, a zipper nanobeam photonic crystal cavity and a double-microdisk whispering-gallery resonator. The strong optical gradient force within these cavities is shown to introduce significant optical rigidity into the structure, with the dressed mechanical states renormalized into optically bright and optically dark modes of motion. With the addition of internal mechanical coupling between mechanical modes, a form of optically controlled mechanical transparency is demonstrated in analogy to electromagnetically induced transparency of three-level atomic media. Based upon these measurements, a proposal for coherently transferring radio-frequency/microwave signals between the optical field and a long-lived dark mechanical state is described.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Thomas J.

article,Quantum-optical state engineering up to the two-photon level,"<p>The ability to prepare arbitrary quantum states within a certain Hilbert space is the holy grail of quantum information technology. It is particularly important for light, as this is the only physical system that can communicate quantum information over long distances. We propose and experimentally verify a scheme to produce arbitrary single-mode states of a travelling light field up to the two-photon level. The desired state is remotely prepared in the signal channel of spontaneous parametric down-conversion by means of conditional measurements on the idler channel. The measurement consists of bringing the idler field into interference with two ancilla coherent states, followed by two single-photon detectors, which, in coincidence, herald the preparation event. By varying the amplitudes and phases of the ancillae, we can prepare any arbitrary superposition of zero-, one- and two-photon states.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Information Science, University of Calgary, Calgary, T2N 1N4, Alberta, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Erwan Bimbard"", "",\u00a0Nitin Jain"", "",\u00a0Andrew MacRae"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0A.

article,Real-time full-field arbitrary optical waveform measurement,"<p>The development of a real-time optical waveform measurement technique with quantum-limited sensitivity, unlimited record lengths and an instantaneous bandwidth scalable to terahertz frequencies would be beneficial in the investigation of many ultrafast optical phenomena. Currently, full-field (amplitude and phase) optical measurements with a bandwidth greater than 100&#160;GHz require repetitive signals to facilitate equivalent-time sampling methods or are single-shot in nature with limited time records. Here, we demonstrate a bandwidth- and time-record scalable measurement that performs parallel coherent detection on spectral slices of arbitrary optical waveforms in the 1.55&#160;&#181;m telecommunications band. External balanced photodetection and high-speed digitizers record the in-phase and quadrature-phase components of each demodulated spectral slice, and digital signal processing reconstructs the signal waveform. The approach is passive, extendable to other regions of the optical spectrum, and can be implemented as a single silicon photonic integrated circuit.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, One Shields Ave., Davis, 95616, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nicolas K.
