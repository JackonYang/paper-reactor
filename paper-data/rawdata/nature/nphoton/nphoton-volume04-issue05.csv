letter,Graphene photodetectors for high-speed optical communications,"<p>Although silicon has dominated solid-state electronics for more than four decades, a variety of other materials are used in photonic devices to expand the wavelength range of operation and improve performance. For example, gallium-nitride based materials enable light emission at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths, and high index contrast silicon-on-insulator facilitates ultradense photonic devices. Here, we report the first use of a photodetector based on graphene, a two-dimensional carbon material, in a 10&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> optical data link. In this interdigitated metal&#8211;graphene&#8211;metal photodetector, an asymmetric metallization scheme is adopted to break the mirror symmetry of the internal electric-field profile in conventional graphene field-effect transistor channels, allowing for efficient photodetection. A maximum external photoresponsivity of 6.1&#160;mA&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is achieved at a wavelength of 1.55&#160;&#181;m. Owing to the unique band structure of graphene and extensive developments in graphene electronics and wafer-scale synthesis, graphene-based integrated electronic&#8211;photonic circuits with an operational wavelength range spanning 300&#160;nm to 6&#160;&#181;m (and possibly beyond) can be expected in the future.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IBM Thomas J.

letter,Polarization-entangled photons produced with high-symmetry site-controlled quantum dots,"<p>Efficient sources of entangled photons &#8216;on demand&#8217; are crucial for the development of quantum information technology. Such sources cannot rely on parametric down-conversion techniques because they generate entangled pairs with Poissonian statistics. Biexciton&#8211;exciton decays in semiconductor quantum dots have been proposed and demonstrated as a source of triggered polarization-entangled photons, but their efficiency is limited by the fine-structure splitting of exciton transitions due to low quantum dot symmetry. Here, we report on the generation of entangled photons from highly symmetric, site-controlled quantum dots grown in inverted pyramids. Polarization entanglement is demonstrated by measurements of the two-photon density matrix and the confirmation of several entanglement criteria. The unique symmetry and exceptional uniformity of the pyramidal quantum dots provide significant potential for producing sources of triggered entangled photons from as-grown quantum dots without resorting to any of the post-processing steps customarily used in previous studies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Laboratory of Physics of Nanostructures, Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""A.

letter,Soliton–similariton fibre laser,"<p>Rapid progress in passively mode-locked fibre lasers is currently driven by the recent discovery of new mode-locking mechanisms, namely, the self-similarly evolving pulse (similariton) and the all-normal-dispersion (dissipative soliton) regimes. These are fundamentally different from the previously known soliton and dispersion-managed soliton (stretched-pulse) regimes. Here, we report a fibre laser in which the mode-locked pulse evolves as a similariton in the gain segment and transforms into a regular soliton in the rest of the cavity. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of similaritons in the presence of gain, that is, amplifier similaritons, within a laser cavity. The existence of solutions in a dissipative nonlinear cavity comprising a periodic combination of two distinct nonlinear waves is novel and likely to be applicable to various other nonlinear systems. For very large filter bandwidths, our laser approaches the working regime of dispersion-managed soliton lasers; for very small anomalous-dispersion segment lengths it approaches dissipative soliton lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Graduate Program of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, Bilkent University, Ankara, 06800, Turkey"", ""authors"": [""Bulent Oktem""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Bilkent University, Ankara, 06800, Turkey"", ""authors"": [""Co\u015fkun \u00dclg\u00fcd\u00fcr"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0F. \u00d6mer Ilday""]}]",False,"[""Bulent Oktem"", ""Co\u015fkun \u00dclg\u00fcd\u00fcr"", ""F. \u00d6mer Ilday""]","Oktem, B., Ülgüdür, C. & Ilday, F.

letter,Directional control of light by a nano-optical Yagi–Uda antenna,"<p>The plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles can direct light from optical emitters in much the same way that radiofrequency antennas direct the emission from electrical circuits. Recently, rapid progress has been made in the realization of single-element antennas for optical waves. Because most of these devices are designed to optimize the local near-field coupling between the antenna and an emitter, the possibility of modifying the spatial radiation pattern has not yet received as much attention. In the radiofrequency regime, a typical antenna design for high directivity is the Yagi&#8211;Uda antenna, which essentially consists of a one-dimensional array of antenna elements driven by a single feed element. By fabricating a corresponding array of nanoparticles, similar radiation patterns can be obtained in the optical regime. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of directional control of radiation from a nano-optical Yagi&#8211;Uda antenna composed of appropriately tuned gold nanorods.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Graduate School of Advanced Sciences of Matter, Hiroshima University, Kagamiyama 1-3-1, Higashihiroshima, 739-8530, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Terukazu Kosako"", "",\u00a0Yutaka Kadoya"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Holger F.

letter,Heralded noiseless linear amplification and distillation of entanglement,"<p>Signal amplification is ubiquitous in the control of physical systems, and the ultimate performance limit of amplifiers is set by quantum physics. Increasing the amplitude of an unknown quantum optical field, or any harmonic oscillator state, must introduce noise. This linear amplification noise prevents perfect copying of the quantum state, enforces quantum limits on communications and metrology, and is the mechanism preventing the increase of entanglement via local operations. Non-deterministic versions of ideal cloning and local entanglement increase (distillation) are allowed, suggesting the possibility of non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification. Here we introduce, and experimentally demonstrate, such a noiseless linear amplifier for quantum states of the optical field, and use it for distillation of field-mode entanglement. This simple but powerful circuit enables practical devices for enhancing quantum technologies. The idea of noiseless amplification unifies approaches to cloning and distillation, and will find applications in quantum metrology and communications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre for Quantum Computer Technology, Centre for Quantum Dynamics, Griffith University, Brisbane, 4111, Queensland, Australia"", ""authors"": [""G.

letter,Exploiting disorder for perfect focusing,"<p>Optical microscopy and manipulation methods rely on the ability to focus light to a small volume. However, in inhomogeneous media such as biological tissue, light is scattered out of the focusing beam. Disordered scattering is thought to fundamentally limit the resolution and penetration depth of optical methods. Here we demonstrate, in an optical experiment, that scattering can be used to improve, rather than deteriorate, the sharpness of the focus. The resulting focus is even sharper than that in a transparent medium. By using scattering in the medium behind a lens, light was focused to a spot ten times smaller than the diffraction limit of that lens. Our method is the optical equivalent of highly successful methods for improving the resolution and communication bandwidth of ultrasound, radio waves and microwaves. Our results, obtained using spatial wavefront shaping, apply to all coherent methods for focusing through scattering matter, including phase conjugation and time-reversal.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Complex Photonic Systems, Faculty of Science and Technology, and MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Twente, PO Box 217, Enschede, 7500, AE, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""I.

article,Nonlinear self-filtering of noisy images via dynamical stochastic resonance,"<p>From night vision and objects overwhelmed by sunlight to jammed signals and those that are purposely encrypted, detecting low-level or hidden signals is a fundamental problem in imaging. Here, we develop and exploit a new type of stochastic resonance, in which nonlinear coupling allows signals to grow at the expense of noise, to recover noise-hidden images propagating in a self-focusing medium. The growth rate is derived analytically by treating the signal&#8211;noise interaction as a photonic beam&#8211;plasma instability and matches experimentally measured resonances in coupling strength, noise statistics and modal content of the signal. This is the first observation of nonlinear intensity exchange between coherent and spatially incoherent light and the first demonstration of spatial coherence resonance for a dynamically evolving signal. The results suggest a general method of reconstructing images through seeded instability and confirm information limits predicted, but not yet observed, in nonlinear communications systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Dmitry V.

article,Measuring the light emission profile in organic light-emitting diodes with nanometre spatial resolution,"<p>Determining the precise shape of the emission profile across the thickness of the active layer in organic light-emitting diodes is of importance for device optimization and assessing the validity of advanced device models. We present a comprehensive method for accurately measuring the shape of the emission profile, the intrinsic spectrum of emitting dipoles and the emitting dipole orientation. The method uses a microcavity light outcoupling model, which includes self-absorption and optical anisotropy, and is based on the full wavelength, angle and polarization resolved emission intensity. Application to blue (polyfluorene-based) and orange-red (NRS-PPV) polymer organic light-emitting diodes reveals a peaked shape of the emission profile. A significant voltage and layer thickness dependence of the peak positions is observed, with a demonstrated resolution better than 5&#160;nm.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Molecular Materials and Nanosystems, Eindhoven University of Technology, PO Box 513, MB Eindhoven, 5600, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""S.
