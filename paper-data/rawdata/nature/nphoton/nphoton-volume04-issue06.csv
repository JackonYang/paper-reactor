letter,XFROG phase measurement of threshold harmonics in a Keldysh-scaled system,"<p>Attosecond pulses are created (by Fourier synthesis) from a comb of odd-order high harmonics resulting from the non-perturbative interaction of intense near-visible laser light with an atomic gas. When produced by a mid-infrared laser, harmonics can have simultaneously high order, visible wavelength, and photon energy below the ionization threshold, I<sub>p</sub>, of the generating atom. Methods requiring photon energies greater than I<sub>p</sub> have been developed that measure the spectral amplitude and phase necessary for temporal reconstruction of the harmonic radiation. Here we report the temporal characterization of below-threshold harmonics using sum frequency generation cross-correlation frequency resolved optical gating (SFG XFROG), a technique sensitive to the relative delay between orders, coupled with a novel approach that makes use of the Keldysh scaling in strong-field physics. The results surprisingly suggest non-perturbative generation of below threshold harmonics, providing a potential alternative to existing vacuum&#8211;ultraviolet frequency comb generation methods.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, Michigan, USA"", ""authors"": [""Erik P.

letter,Experimental quantum-enhanced estimation of a lossy phase shift,"<p>A paradigm for quantum-enhanced precision metrology is found in optical interferometry, which is capable of sensing diverse physical quantities through measurement of a phase shift. When standard light sources are used, the precision of the phase determination is limited by shot noise, the origin of which can be traced to the random manner in which individual photons emerge from the interferometer. Quantum entanglement provides a means to exceed this limit with the celebrated example of N00N states, which saturate the ultimate Heisenberg limit on precision, but are extremely fragile to losses. In contrast, we present experimental evidence that appropriately engineered quantum states outperform both standard and N00N states in the precision of phase estimation when losses are present. This shows that the quantum enhancement of metrology is possible even when decoherence is present, and that the strategy for realizing the enhancement is quite distinct from protecting quantum information encoded in light.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Physics, Nicolaus Copernicus University, ul.

letter,Exciton–polariton spin switches,"<p>Integrated switching devices comprise the building blocks of ultrafast optical signal processing. As the next stage following intensity switching, circular polarization switches are attracting considerable interest because of their applications in spin-based architectures. They usually take advantage of nonlinear optical effects, and require high powers and external optical elements. Semiconductor microcavities provide a significant step forward due to their low-threshold, polarization-dependent, nonlinear emission, fast operation and integrability. Here, we demonstrate a non-local, all-optical spin switch based on exciton&#8211;polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity. In the presence of a sub-threshold pump laser (dark regime), a tightly localized probe induces the switch-on of the entire pumped area. If the pump is circularly polarized, the switch is conditional on the polarization of the probe, but if it is linearly polarized, a circularly polarized probe fully determines the final polarization of the pumped area. These results set the basis for the development of spin-based logic devices, integrated in a chip.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and CNRS, UPMC Case 74, 4 place Jussieu, Paris Cedex 05, 75252, France"", ""authors"": [""A.

letter,Ultrafast optical spin echo in a single quantum dot,"<p>Many proposed photonic quantum networks rely on matter qubits to serve as memory elements. The spin of a single electron confined in a semiconductor quantum dot forms a promising matter qubit that may be interfaced with a photonic network. Ultrafast optical spin control allows gate operations to be performed on the spin within a picosecond timescale, orders of magnitude faster than microwave or electrical control. One obstacle to storing quantum information in a single quantum dot spin is the apparent nanosecond-timescale dephasing due to slow variations in the background nuclear magnetic field. Here we use an ultrafast, all-optical spin echo technique to increase the decoherence time of a single quantum dot electron spin from nanoseconds to several microseconds. The ratio of decoherence time to gate time exceeds 10<sup>5</sup>, suggesting strong promise for future photonic quantum information processors and repeater networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""E. L.

letter,Room-temperature polariton lasing in an organic single-crystal microcavity,"<p>The optical properties of organic semiconductors are almost exclusively described using the Frenkel exciton picture. In this description, the strong Coulombic interaction between an excited electron and the charged vacancy it leaves behind (a hole) is automatically taken into account. If, in an optical microcavity, the exciton&#8211;photon interaction is strong compared to the excitonic and photonic decay rates, a second quasiparticle, the microcavity polariton, must be introduced to properly account for this coupling. Coherent, laser-like emission from polaritons has been predicted to occur when the ground-state occupancy of polaritons &#12296;n<sub>gs</sub>&#12297;, reaches 1 (ref.&#160;). This process, known as polariton lasing, can occur at thresholds much lower than required for conventional lasing. Polaritons in organic semiconductors are highly stable at room temperature, but to our knowledge, there has as yet been no report of nonlinear emission from these structures. Here, we demonstrate polariton lasing at room temperature in an organic microcavity composed of a melt-grown anthracene single crystal sandwiched between two dielectric mirrors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""S.

letter,Experimental free-space quantum teleportation,"<p>Quantum teleportation is central to the practical realization of quantum communication. Although the first proof-of-principle demonstration was reported in 1997 by the Innsbruck and Rome groups, long-distance teleportation has so far only been realized in fibre with lengths of hundreds of metres. An optical free-space link is highly desirable for extending the transfer distance, because of its low atmospheric absorption for certain ranges of wavelength. By following the Rome scheme, which allows a full Bell-state measurement, we report free-space implementation of quantum teleportation over 16&#160;km. An active feed-forward technique has been developed to enable real-time information transfer. An average fidelity of 89%, well beyond the classical limit of 2/3, is achieved. Our experiment has realized all of the non-local aspects of the original teleportation scheme and is equivalent to it up to a local unitary operation. Our result confirms the feasibility of space-based experiments, and is an important step towards quantum-communication applications on a global scale.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, PR China"", ""authors"": [""Xian-Min Jin"", "",\u00a0Ji-Gang Ren"", "",\u00a0Bin Yang"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Fan Xu"", "",\u00a0Yuan-Feng Hu"", "",\u00a0Tao Yang"", "",\u00a0Hao Yin"", "",\u00a0Kai Chen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""Physics Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, PR China"", ""authors"": [""Ji-Gang Ren"", "",\u00a0Zhen-Huan Yi"", "",\u00a0Fei Zhou"", "",\u00a0Shao-Kai Wang"", "",\u00a0Dong Yang"", "",\u00a0Shuo Jiang"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}]",False,"[""Xian-Min Jin"", ""Ji-Gang Ren"", ""Bin Yang"", ""Zhen-Huan Yi"", ""Fei Zhou"", ""Xiao-Fan Xu"", ""Shao-Kai Wang"", ""Dong Yang"", ""Yuan-Feng Hu"", ""Shuo Jiang"", ""Tao Yang"", ""Hao Yin"", ""Kai Chen"", ""Cheng-Zhi Peng"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Jin, X., Ren, J., Yang, B. et al.

article,Amplification of long-range surface plasmons by a dipolar gain medium,"<p>Surface plasmon&#8211;polaritions, collective electron oscillations coupled to light waves at the surface of a metal, show unique properties that are valuable in a broad range of scientific fields. However, the intrinsic propagation loss of these waves poses a fundamental problem to many potential applications. To overcome this drawback, researchers have explored the possibility of loss compensation by means of surface plasmon&#8211;polarition amplification. Here we provide the first direct measurement of gain in propagating plasmons using the long-range surface plasmon&#8211;polariton supported by a symmetric metal stripe waveguide that incorporates optically pumped dye molecules in solution as the gain medium. The measured mode power gain is 8.55&#160;dB&#160;mm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

article,In situ wavefront correction and its application to micromanipulation,"<p>In any optical system, distortions to a propagating wavefront reduce the spatial coherence of a light field, making it increasingly difficult to obtain the theoretical diffraction-limited spot size. Such aberrations are severely detrimental to optimal performance in imaging, nanosurgery, nanofabrication and micromanipulation, as well as other techniques within modern microscopy. We present a generic method based on complex modulation for true in situ wavefront correction that allows compensation of all aberrations along the entire optical train. The power of the method is demonstrated for the field of micromanipulation, which is very sensitive to wavefront distortions. We present direct trapping with optimally focused laser light carrying power of a fraction of a milliwatt as well as the first trapping through highly turbid and diffusive media.
