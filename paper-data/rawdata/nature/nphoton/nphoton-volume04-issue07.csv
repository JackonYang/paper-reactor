letter,On-chip beam-steering photonic-crystal lasers,"<p>The development of semiconductor lasers with on-chip controllability of the beam direction is important for a wide range of applications, including mobile laser projection displays, advanced laser printers and chip-to-chip optical communication. Here, we report a novel concept to realize such beam-steering lasers using photonic crystals. Our idea is based on the generation of artificial lasing band edges in the photonic band structure, which determine the resonant condition and output beam direction. We show that the lasing band edge can be tuned by using a composite photonic-crystal structure composed of both square and rectangular lattices, and by varying their relative lattice constants. We demonstrate that lasers based on such composite photonic-crystal structures are able to emit beams in a range of directions that can be dynamically controlled by on-chip integration.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yoshitaka Kurosaka"", "",\u00a0Seita Iwahashi"", "",\u00a0Yong Liang"", "",\u00a0Kyosuke Sakai"", "",\u00a0Eiji Miyai"", "",\u00a0Wataru Kunishi"", "",\u00a0Dai Ohnishi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Susumu Noda""]}, {""address"": ""Japan Science and Technology Agency, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yoshitaka Kurosaka"", "",\u00a0Seita Iwahashi"", "",\u00a0Yong Liang"", "",\u00a0Kyosuke Sakai"", "",\u00a0Eiji Miyai"", "",\u00a0Wataru Kunishi"", "",\u00a0Dai Ohnishi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Susumu Noda""]}, {""address"": ""Pioneering Research Unit for Next Generation, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8245, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kyosuke Sakai""]}, {""address"": ""Photonics Research and Development Center, ROHM, Kyoto, 615-8585, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Eiji Miyai"", "",\u00a0Wataru Kunishi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dai Ohnishi""]}, {""address"": ""Photonics and Electronics Science and Engineering Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Susumu Noda""]}]",False,"[""Yoshitaka Kurosaka"", ""Seita Iwahashi"", ""Yong Liang"", ""Kyosuke Sakai"", ""Eiji Miyai"", ""Wataru Kunishi"", ""Dai Ohnishi"", ""Susumu Noda""]","Kurosaka, Y., Iwahashi, S., Liang, Y. et al.

letter,Net optical gain in a plasmonic waveguide embedded in a fluorescent polymer,"<p>Plasmonics&#8212;the study of the interaction between electromagnetic waves and electron plasmas on metal surfaces and in metallic nanostructures&#8212;has received much attention in recent years, with potential new applications ranging from subwavelength photonic circuits to photothermal cancer therapy. In many cases, however, the substantial attenuation of the electromagnetic wave due to absorption (ohmic loss) in the metal is of serious concern. Introduction of optical gain into the dielectric material adjacent to the metal surface has been identified as a means of compensating for the absorption loss, but the experimental realization of lossless propagation or optical gain in plasmonic waveguides has proven elusive. Here, we demonstrate direct proof of plasmonic propagation with net positive gain over macroscopic distances. The gain is provided by an optically pumped layer of fluorescent conjugated polymer adjacent to the metal surface in a dielectric&#8211;metal&#8211;dielectric plasmonic waveguide.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Science Institute, University of Iceland, Dunhagi 3, Reykjavik, IS-107, Iceland"", ""authors"": [""Malte C.

letter,Direct frequency comb synthesis with arbitrary offset and shot-noise-limited phase noise,"<p>Carrier-envelope phase stabilization has opened an avenue towards achieving frequency metrology with unprecedented precision and optical pulse generation on the previously inaccessible attosecond timescale. Recently, sub-100-as pulse generation has been demonstrated, approaching the timescale of the fastest transients in atomic physics. However, further progress in attophysics appears to be limited by the performance of the traditional feedback approach used for carrier-envelope phase stabilization. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually different self-referenced feed-forward approach to phase stabilization. This approach requires no complicated locking electronics, does not compromise laser performance, and is demonstrated with 12-as residual timing jitter, which is below the atomic unit of time. This surpasses the precision of previous methods by more than a factor of five and has potential for resolving even the fastest transients in atomic or molecular physics.

letter,Flat dielectric grating reflectors with focusing abilities,"<p>Sub-wavelength dielectric gratings have emerged recently as a promising alternative to distributed Bragg reflection dielectric stacks for broadband, high-reflectivity filtering applications. Such a grating structure composed of a single dielectric layer with the appropriate patterning can sometimes perform as well as 30 or 40 dielectric distributed Bragg reflection layers, while providing new functionalities such as polarization control and near-field amplification. In this Letter, we introduce an interesting property of grating mirrors that cannot be realized by their distributed Bragg reflection counterpart: we show that a non-periodic patterning of the grating surface can give full control over the phase front of reflected light while maintaining a high reflectivity. This new feature of dielectric gratings allows the creation of miniature planar focusing elements that could have a substantial impact on a number of applications that depend on low-cost, compact optical components, from laser cavities to CD/DVD read/write heads.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, 94304\u20131123, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""David Fattal"", "",\u00a0Jingjing Li"", "",\u00a0Zhen Peng"", "",\u00a0Marco Fiorentino"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Raymond G.

article,Temporal cavity solitons in one-dimensional Kerr media as bits in an all-optical buffer,"<p>Temporal cavity solitons are packets of light persisting in a continuously driven nonlinear resonator. They are robust attracting states, readily excited through a phase-insensitive and wavelength-insensitive process. As such, they constitute an ideal support for bits in an optical buffer that would seamlessly combine three critical telecommunication functions, namely all-optical storage, all-optical reshaping and wavelength conversion. Here, with standard silica optical fibres, we report the first experimental observation of temporal cavity solitons. The cavity solitons are 4 ps long and are used to demonstrate storage of a data stream for more than a second. We also observe interactions of close cavity solitons, revealing for our set-up a potential capacity of up to 45,000 bits at 25&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. More fundamentally, cavity solitons are localized dissipative structures. Therefore, given that silica exhibits a pure instantaneous Kerr nonlinearity, our experiment constitutes one of the simplest examples of self-organization phenomena in nonlinear optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Service OPERA-photonique, Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles (U.L.B.), 50 Avenue F.

article,Sub-femtojoule all-optical switching using a photonic-crystal nanocavity,"<p>Although high-speed all-optical switches are expected to replace their electrical counterparts in information processing, their relatively large size and power consumption have remained obstacles. We use a combination of an ultrasmall photonic-crystal nanocavity and strong carrier-induced nonlinearity in InGaAsP to successfully demonstrate low-energy switching within a few tens of picoseconds. Switching energies with a contrast of 3 and 10&#160;dB of 0.42 and 0.66&#160;fJ, respectively, have been obtained, which are over two orders of magnitude lower than those of previously reported all-optical switches. The ultrasmall cavity substantially enhances the nonlinearity as well as the recovery speed, and the switching efficiency is maximized by a combination of two-photon absorption and linear absorption in the InGaAsP nanocavities. These switches, with their chip-scale integratability, may lead to the possibility of low-power, high-density, all-optical processing in a chip.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1, Morinosato Wakamiya Atsugi, Kanagawa, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kengo Nozaki"", "",\u00a0Takasumi Tanabe"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Hideaki Taniyama"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}, {""address"": ""CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Honmachi, Kawaguchi, 332-0012, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takasumi Tanabe"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Hideaki Taniyama"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1, Morinosato Wakamiya Atsugi, Kanagawa, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Shinji Matsuo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tomonari Sato""]}]",False,"[""Kengo Nozaki"", ""Takasumi Tanabe"", ""Akihiko Shinya"", ""Shinji Matsuo"", ""Tomonari Sato"", ""Hideaki Taniyama"", ""Masaya Notomi""]","Nozaki, K., Tanabe, T., Shinya, A. et al.

article,Magnetic recording at 1.5 Pb m−2 using an integrated plasmonic antenna,"<p>Plasmonic devices are capable of efficiently confining and enhancing optical fields, serving as a bridge between the realm of diffraction-limited optics and the nanoscale. Specifically, a plasmonic device can be used to locally heat a recording medium for data storage. Ideally, the recording medium would consist of individually addressable and non-interacting entities, a configuration that has been regarded as the ultimate future hard-drive technology. Here, we describe a plasmonic nano-antenna that is fully integrated into a magnetic recording head and its use for thermally assisted magnetic recording on both continuous and fully-ordered patterned media using nanosecond pulses in a static tester configuration. In the case of patterned media at 1.5&#160;Pb&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> (&#8764;1 Tb inch<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) with 24-nm track pitch, we show ideally written bits without disturbing neighbouring tracks. We find a dramatic improvement in track width and optical efficiency compared to continuous media and show that this is largely due to advantageous near-field optical effects.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, San Jose Research Center, 3403 Yerba Buena Road, San Jose, 95135, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Barry C.
