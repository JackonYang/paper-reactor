review article,Silicon optical modulators,"<p>Optical technology is poised to revolutionize short-reach interconnects. The leading candidate technology is silicon photonics, and the workhorse of such an interconnect is the optical modulator. Modulators have been improved dramatically in recent years, with a notable increase in bandwidth from the megahertz to the multigigahertz regime in just over half a decade. However, the demands of optical interconnects are significant, and many questions remain unanswered as to whether silicon can meet the required performance metrics. Minimizing metrics such as the device footprint and energy requirement per bit, while also maximizing bandwidth and modulation depth, is non-trivial. All of this must be achieved within an acceptable thermal tolerance and optical spectral width using CMOS-compatible fabrication processes. This Review discusses the techniques that have been (and will continue to be) used to implement silicon optical modulators, as well as providing an outlook for these devices and the candidate solutions of the future.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey, Guildford, GU2 7XH, Surrey, UK"", ""authors"": [""G.

letter,Coherent control of a single exciton qubit by optoelectronic manipulation,"<p>The coherent state manipulation of single quantum systems is a fundamental requirement for the implementation of quantum information processors. Exciton qubits are of particular interest for coherent optoelectronic applications, in particular due to their excellent coupling to photons. Until now, coherent manipulations of exciton qubits in semiconductor quantum dots have been performed predominantly by pulsed laser fields. Coherent control of the population of excitonic states with a single laser pulse, observed by Rabi oscillations, has been demonstrated by several groups using different techniques. By using two laser pulses, more general state control can be achieved, and coupling of two excitons has been reported. Here, we present a conceptually new approach for implementing the coherent control of an exciton two-level system (qubit) by means of a time-dependent electric interaction. The new scheme makes use of an optical clock signal and a synchronous electric gate signal, which controls the coherent manipulation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department Physik and Center for Optoelectronics and Photonics Paderborn (CeOPP), Universit\u00e4t Paderborn, Warburger Str. 100, Paderborn, 33098, Germany"", ""authors"": [""S.

letter,Experimental demonstration of a heralded entanglement source,"<p>The heralded generation of entangled states is a long-standing goal in quantum information processing, because it is indispensable for a number of quantum protocols. Polarization entangled photon pairs are usually generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, but the emission is probabilistic. Their applications are generally accompanied by post-selection and destructive photon detection. Here, we report a source of entanglement generated in an event-ready manner by conditioned detection of auxiliary photons. This scheme benefits from the stable and robust properties of spontaneous parametric down-conversion and requires only modest experimental efforts. It is flexible and allows the preparation efficiency to be significantly improved by using beamsplitters with different transmission ratios. We have achieved a fidelity better than 87% and a state preparation efficiency of 45% for the source. This could offer promise in essential photonics-based quantum information tasks, and particularly in enabling optical quantum computing by reducing dramatically the computational overhead.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physikalisches Institut, Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Philosophenweg 12, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Claudia Wagenknecht"", "",\u00a0Che-Ming Li"", "",\u00a0Andreas Reingruber"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Hui Bao"", "",\u00a0Alexander Goebel"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ao Chen"", "",\u00a0Qiang Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics and National Center for Theoretical Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701, Taiwan"", ""authors"": [""Che-Ming Li""]}, {""address"": ""Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Xiao-Hui Bao"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ao Chen"", "",\u00a0Kai Chen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}]",False,"[""Claudia Wagenknecht"", ""Che-Ming Li"", ""Andreas Reingruber"", ""Xiao-Hui Bao"", ""Alexander Goebel"", ""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Qiang Zhang"", ""Kai Chen"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Wagenknecht, C., Li, C., Reingruber, A. et al.

letter,Heralded generation of entangled photon pairs,"<p>Entangled photons are a crucial resource for quantum communication and linear optical quantum computation. Unfortunately, the applicability of many photon-based schemes is limited due to the stochastic character of the photon sources. Therefore, a worldwide effort has focused on overcoming the limitation of probabilistic emission by generating two-photon entangled states conditioned on the detection of auxiliary photons. Here we present the first heralded generation of photon states that are maximally entangled in polarization with linear optics and standard photon detection from spontaneous parametric downconversion. We use the downconversion state corresponding to the generation of three photon pairs, where the coincident detection of four auxiliary photons unambiguously heralds the successful preparation of the entangled state. This controlled generation of entangled photon states is a significant step towards the applicability of a linear optics quantum network, in particular for entanglement swapping, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and scalable approaches towards photonics-based quantum computing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Faculty of Physics, University of Vienna, Boltzmanngasse 5, Vienna, A-1090, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Stefanie Barz"", "",\u00a0Gunther Cronenberg"", "",\u00a0Anton Zeilinger"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Philip Walther""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI), Austrian Academy of Sciences, Boltzmanngasse 3, Vienna, A-1090, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Stefanie Barz"", "",\u00a0Gunther Cronenberg"", "",\u00a0Anton Zeilinger"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Philip Walther""]}]",False,"[""Stefanie Barz"", ""Gunther Cronenberg"", ""Anton Zeilinger"", ""Philip Walther""]","Barz, S., Cronenberg, G., Zeilinger, A. et al.

letter,Mid-infrared optical parametric amplifier using silicon nanophotonic waveguides,"<p>All-optical signal processing is an approach used to dramatically decrease power consumption and speed up the performance of next-generation optical telecommunications networks. Nonlinear optical effects such as four-wave mixing and parametric gain have been explored to realize all-optical functions in glass fibres. An alternative approach is to use nanoscale engineering of silicon waveguides to enhance optical nonlinearities by up to five orders of magnitude, enabling integrated chip-scale all-optical signal processing. Four-wave mixing within silicon nanophotonic waveguides has been used to demonstrate telecom-band (&#955;&#160;&#8776;&#160;1,550&#160;nm) all-optical functions including wavelength conversion, signal regeneration and tunable optical delay. Despite these important advances, strong two-photon absorption of the telecom-band pump presents a fundamental obstacle, limiting parametric gain to values of several decibels. Here, we demonstrate a silicon nanophotonic optical parametric amplifier exhibiting broadband gain as high as 25.4&#160;dB, using a mid-infrared pump near one-half the bandgap energy (E&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.55&#160;eV, &#955;&#160;&#8776;&#160;2,200&#160;nm), where parasitic two-photon absorption-related absorption vanishes. This gain is high enough to compensate all insertion losses, resulting in 13-dB net off-chip amplification, using only an ultra-compact 4-mm silicon chip. Furthermore, engineering of higher-order waveguide dispersion can potentially enable mid-infrared-pumped silicon parametric oscillators and amplifiers for telecom-band optical signals.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, 1300 S.W.

letter,Mid-infrared wavelength conversion in silicon waveguides using ultracompact telecom-band-derived pump source,"<p>Mid-infrared light sources are essential for applications that include free-space communication, chemical and biomolecular sensing and infrared spectroscopy, but no devices comparable to those in the near-infrared regime have emerged to date. Indeed, sources operating above 1.8&#160;&#181;m, including optical parametric oscillators and thulium-doped fibre lasers, do not combine a large tunable range and narrow linewidth, and generally cannot be modulated to support advanced applications. Widely tunable mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers are available; however, room-temperature operation in the 3&#8211;4&#160;&#181;m range still presents a challenge because of material limitations. Wavelength conversion in silicon offers promise for the development of an ultracompact mid-infrared source that combines wide wavelength tuning, narrow linewidth and arbitrarily complex modulation rivalling those in the telecom window.

article,Monolithically integrated solid-state terahertz transceivers,"<p>Recent advances in microfabricated terahertz quantum cascade lasers have achieved coherent power and frequency performance previously possible only with much larger gas- or vacuum-tube sources. A significant advantage offered by terahertz quantum cascade lasers lies in the potential to integrate them with other components on the same chip. Such terahertz photonic integrated circuits would help close the terahertz technology gap between microwave electronics and infrared photonics. Here, we describe the first successful monolithic integration of a terahertz quantum cascade laser and diode mixer to form a simple but generically useful terahertz photonic integrated circuit&#8212;a microelectronic terahertz transceiver. We show that this terahertz photonic integrated circuit performs all the basic functions (for example, transmission of a coherent carrier, heterodyne reception of an external signal, frequency locking and tuning) of discrete-component terahertz photonic systems, but at a small fraction of the size and in a robust platform scalable to semiconductor fabrication production.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87185, USA"", ""authors"": [""Michael C.

article,Quasi-phase-matching of momentum and energy in nonlinear optical processes,"<p>Quasi-phase-matching is an important technique in nonlinear optics and is in widespread use. It not only makes efficient frequency conversion possible, but also enables diverse applications such as beam and pulse shaping, multi-harmonic generation, high harmonic generation, all-optical processing and the generation of entangled photons. However, since its introduction in the early 1960s at the dawn of nonlinear optics, quasi-phase-matching has always been considered a technique in which a purely spatial modulation mitigates the momentum mismatch that dispersion imposes on the interacting photons. Here, we present an important and fundamental generalization of quasi-phase-matching in which spatiotemporal nonlinear optical diffraction allows for correction of both momentum and energy mismatch. This concept provides a powerful tool for manipulating light through nonlinear interactions, and suggests unique applications. Recent experiments provide evidence for the feasibility and importance of spatiotemporal quasi-phase-matching.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""JILA and Department of Physics, University of Colorado and NIST, Boulder, 80309, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alon Bahabad"", "",\u00a0Margaret M.
