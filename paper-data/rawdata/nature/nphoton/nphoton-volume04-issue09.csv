review article,Graphene photonics and optoelectronics,"<p>The richness of optical and electronic properties of graphene attracts enormous interest. Graphene has high mobility and optical transparency, in addition to flexibility, robustness and environmental stability. So far, the main focus has been on fundamental physics and electronic devices. However, we believe its true potential lies in photonics and optoelectronics, where the combination of its unique optical and electronic properties can be fully exploited, even in the absence of a bandgap, and the linear dispersion of the Dirac electrons enables ultrawideband tunability. The rise of graphene in photonics and optoelectronics is shown by several recent results, ranging from solar cells and light-emitting devices to touch screens, photodetectors and ultrafast lasers. Here we review the state-of-the-art in this emerging field.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0FA, UK"", ""authors"": [""F.

letter,Optical pacing of the embryonic heart,"<p>Light has been used to non-invasively alter the excitability of both neural and cardiac tissue. Recently, pulsed laser light has been shown to be capable of eliciting action potentials in peripheral nerves and in cultured cardiomyocytes. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate optical pacing of an intact heart in vivo. Pulsed 1.875-&#181;m infrared laser light was used to lock the heart rate to the pulse frequency of the laser. A laser Doppler velocimetry signal was used to verify the pacing. At low radiant exposures, embryonic quail hearts were reliably paced in vivo without detectable damage to the tissue, indicating that optical pacing has great potential as a tool with which to study embryonic cardiac dynamics and development. In particular, optical pacing can be used to control the heart rate, thereby altering stresses and mechanically transduced signalling.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, 44106, Ohio, USA"", ""authors"": [""M.

letter,Broadband terahertz wave remote sensing using coherent manipulation of fluorescence from asymmetrically ionized gases,"<p>Terahertz wave sensing and imaging have received a great deal of attention because of their significant scientific and technological potential in multidisciplinary fields. However, owing to the challenge of dealing with high ambient moisture absorption, the development of remote open-air broadband terahertz spectroscopy is lagging behind the urgent need for the technology that exists in homeland security and the fields of astronomy and environmental monitoring. The requirement for on-site bias or forward collection of the optical signal in conventional terahertz detection techniques has inevitably prohibited their use in remote sensing. We introduce an &#8216;all-optical&#8217; technique of broadband terahertz wave detection by coherently manipulating the fluorescence emission from asymmetrically ionized gas plasma interacting with terahertz waves. Owing to the high atmospheric transparency and omnidirectional emission pattern of the fluorescence, this technique can be used to measure terahertz pulses at standoff distances with minimal water vapour absorption and unlimited directionality for optical signal collection. We demonstrate coherent terahertz wave detection at a distance of 10&#160;m.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Terahertz Research, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, 12180, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jingle Liu"", "",\u00a0Jianming Dai"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0X.-C.

letter,Two-photon interference of the emission from electrically tunable remote quantum dots,"<p>Self-assembled quantum dots comprise a versatile system with which to study quantum effects in the solid state. Many devices have been developed that demonstrate controlled charging of a quantum dot, Rabi oscillations, coherent spin control and electrically injected non-classical photon emission. Often referred to as &#8216;artificial atoms&#8217;, quantum dots have discrete energy levels, making them a viable candidate for encoding qubits. However, unlike single atoms, no two quantum dots are alike. This is a complication for quantum-information applications that require qubits initialized in the same state and interactions between remote systems mediated by indistinguishable photons. We report that truly remote, independent, quantum dots can be tuned to the same energy using large applied electric fields. This allows two-photon interference of their emission under coincidence gating and opens up the possibility of transferring quantum information between remote solid-state sources.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Cambridge Research Laboratory, 208 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0GZ, UK"", ""authors"": [""Raj B.

letter,Phase-locking of a 2.7-THz quantum cascade laser to a mode-locked erbium-doped fibre laser,"<p>Mode-locked femtosecond lasers have revolutionized the field of optical metrology by allowing the realization of ultra-stable phase-coherent links between the optical-frequency domain and the radiofrequency range. In this work we have used the electro-optic effect in ZnTe (ref.&#160;) to demonstrate that the frequency and the phase of a 2.7&#160;THz quantum cascade laser can be actively stabilized to the nth harmonic of the 90&#160;MHz repetition rate (f<sub>rep</sub>) of a commercial, mode-locked erbium-doped fibre laser. The beating between the stabilized quantum cascade laser frequency and the harmonic of f<sub>rep</sub> yield a signal-to-noise ratio of 80 dB in a bandwidth of 1 Hz. The technique is inherently broadband, that is, it is applicable to any quantum cascade laser source provided that its frequency falls within the spectral bandwidth of the femtosecond laser (&#8764;5 THz). Furthermore, it is an ideal tool with which to control the phase of different quantum cascade lasers using light and compact fibre technology rather than superconducting bolometer mixers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Mat\u00e9riaux et Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes Quantiques, Universit\u00e9 Paris 7and CNRS UMR 7162, 10 rue A.

article,High-speed ultracompact buried heterostructure photonic-crystal laser with 13 fJ of energy consumed per bit transmitted,"<p>The ability to directly modulate a nanocavity laser with ultralow power consumption is essential for the realization of a CMOS-integrated, on-chip photonic network, as several thousand lasers must be integrated onto a single chip. Here, we show high-speed direct modulation (3-dB modulation bandwidth of 5.5&#160;GHz) of an ultracompact InP/InGaAsP buried heterostructure photonic-crystal laser at room temperature by optical pumping. The required energy for transmitting one bit is estimated to be 13&#160;fJ. We also achieve a threshold input power of 1.5&#160;&#181;W, which is the lowest observed value for room-temperature continuous-wave operation of any type of laser. The maximum single-mode fibre output power of 0.44&#160;&#181;W is the highest output power, to our knowledge, for photonic-crystal nanocavity lasers under room-temperature continuous-wave operation. Implementing a buried heterostructure leads to excellent device performance, reducing the active region temperature and effectively confining the carriers inside the cavity.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1, Morinosato Wakamiya, Atsugi, Kanagawa, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Shinji Matsuo"", "",\u00a0Takaaki Kakitsuka"", "",\u00a0Toru Segawa"", "",\u00a0Tomonari Sato"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yoshihiro Kawaguchi""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1, Morinosato Wakamiya, Atsugi, Kanagawa, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Kengo Nozaki"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}]",False,"[""Shinji Matsuo"", ""Akihiko Shinya"", ""Takaaki Kakitsuka"", ""Kengo Nozaki"", ""Toru Segawa"", ""Tomonari Sato"", ""Yoshihiro Kawaguchi"", ""Masaya Notomi""]","Matsuo, S., Shinya, A., Kakitsuka, T. et al.
