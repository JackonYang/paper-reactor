Such lasers encompass a multitude of remarkable features, including wideband tunability, large coherence area and, in some cases, multidirectional emission. They have the potential to combine large output powers with miniature cavity dimensions &#8212; two properties that have traditionally been incompatible.

letter,Hacking commercial quantum cryptography systems by tailored bright illumination,"<p>The peculiar properties of quantum mechanics allow two remote parties to communicate a private, secret key, which is protected from eavesdropping by the laws of physics. So-called quantum key distribution (QKD) implementations always rely on detectors to measure the relevant quantum property of single photons. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the detectors in two commercially available QKD systems can be fully remote-controlled using specially tailored bright illumination. This makes it possible to tracelessly acquire the full secret key; we propose an eavesdropping apparatus built from off-the-shelf components. The loophole is likely to be present in most QKD systems using avalanche photodiodes to detect single photons. We believe that our findings are crucial for strengthening the security of practical QKD, by identifying and patching technological deficiencies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, NO-7491, Norway"", ""authors"": [""Lars Lydersen"", "",\u00a0Johannes Skaar"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Vadim Makarov""]}, {""address"": ""University Graduate Center, Kjeller, NO-2027, Norway"", ""authors"": [""Lars Lydersen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Johannes Skaar""]}, {""address"": ""Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, G\u00fcnther-Scharowsky-Strasse 1/Bau 24, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Carlos Wiechers"", "",\u00a0Christoffer Wittmann"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dominique Elser""]}, {""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Optik, Information und Photonik, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Staudtstra\u00dfe 7/B2, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Carlos Wiechers"", "",\u00a0Christoffer Wittmann"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dominique Elser""]}, {""address"": ""Departamento de F\u00edsica, Universidad de Guanajuato, Lomas del Bosque 103, Fraccionamiento Lomas del Campestre, 37150, Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, M\u00e9xico"", ""authors"": [""Carlos Wiechers""]}]",False,"[""Lars Lydersen"", ""Carlos Wiechers"", ""Christoffer Wittmann"", ""Dominique Elser"", ""Johannes Skaar"", ""Vadim Makarov""]","Lydersen, L., Wiechers, C., Wittmann, C. et al.

letter,All-optical phase and amplitude regenerator for next-generation telecommunications systems,"<p>Fibre-optic communications systems have traditionally carried data using binary (on&#8722;off) encoding of the light amplitude. However, next-generation systems will use both the amplitude and phase of the optical carrier to achieve higher spectral efficiencies and thus higher overall data capacities. Although this approach requires highly complex transmitters and receivers, the increased capacity and many further practical benefits that accrue from a full knowledge of the amplitude and phase of the optical field more than outweigh this additional hardware complexity and can greatly simplify optical network design. However, use of the complex optical field gives rise to a new dominant limitation to system performance&#8212;nonlinear phase noise. Developing a device to remove this noise is therefore of great technical importance. Here, we report the development of the first practical (&#8216;black-box&#8217;) all-optical regenerator capable of removing both phase and amplitude noise from binary phase-encoded optical communications signals.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK"", ""authors"": [""Radan Slav\u00edk"", "",\u00a0Francesca Parmigiani"", "",\u00a0Joseph Kakande"", "",\u00a0Sonali Dasgupta"", "",\u00a0Periklis Petropoulos"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0David J.

letter,Subnanosecond spectral diffusion measurement using photon correlation,"<p>Spectral diffusion is a result of random spectral jumps of a narrow line as a result of a fluctuating environment. It is an important issue in spectroscopy, because the observed spectral broadening prevents access to the intrinsic line properties. However, its characteristic parameters provide local information on the environment of a light emitter embedded in a solid matrix, or moving within a fluid, leading to numerous applications in physics and biology. We present a new experimental technique for measuring spectral diffusion based on photon correlations within a spectral line. Autocorrelation on half of the line and cross-correlation between the two halves give a quantitative value of the spectral diffusion time, with a resolution only limited by the correlation set-up. We have measured spectral diffusion of the photoluminescence of a single light emitter with a time resolution of 90&#160;ps, exceeding by four orders of magnitude the best resolution reported to date.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CEA\u2013CNRS\u2013UJF group \u2018Nanophysique et Semiconducteurs\u2019, Institut N\u00e9el, CNRS \u2013 Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, 38042, France"", ""authors"": [""G.

letter,Quantum optical coherence can survive photon losses using a continuous-variable quantum erasure-correcting code,"<p>A fundamental requirement for enabling fault-tolerant quantum information processing is an efficient quantum error-correcting code that robustly protects the involved fragile quantum states from their environment. Just as classical error-correcting codes are indispensible in today's information technologies, it is believed that quantum error-correcting code will play a similarly crucial role in tomorrow's quantum information systems. Here, we report on the experimental demonstration of a quantum erasure-correcting code that overcomes the devastating effect of photon losses. Our quantum code is based on linear optics, and it protects a four-mode entangled mesoscopic state of light against erasures. We investigate two approaches for circumventing in-line losses, and demonstrate that both approaches exhibit transmission fidelities beyond what is possible by classical means. Because in-line attenuation is generally the strongest limitation to quantum communication, such an erasure-correcting code provides a new tool for establishing quantum optical coherence over longer distances.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Technical University of Denmark, Fysikvej, Kongens Lyngby, 2800, Denmark"", ""authors"": [""Mikael Lassen"", "",\u00a0Metin Sabuncu"", "",\u00a0Alexander Huck"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ulrik L.

letter,Ultrafast Rabi flopping and coherent pulse propagation in a quantum cascade laser,"<p>Pulse propagation phenomena are central to ultrashort pulse generation and amplification in lasers. In the coherent regime, the phase relationship between the pulse and the material transition is preserved, allowing both optical fields and material states to be controlled. The most prominent form of coherent manipulation is Rabi flopping, a phenomenon well established in few-level absorbers, including atoms and single quantum dots. However, Rabi flopping is generally much weaker in semiconductors because of strong dephasing in the electronic bands, in contrast to discrete-level systems. Although low-density induced coherent oscillations have been observed in semiconductor absorbers, coherent pulse propagation phenomena in active semiconductor devices have not been observed. In this Letter, we explore coherent pulse propagation in an operating quantum cascade laser and directly observe Rabi flopping and coherent pulse reshaping. This work demonstrates the applicability of few-level models for quantum cascade lasers and may stimulate novel approaches to short pulse generation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Ultrafast Optical Science and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109-2099, Michigan, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hyunyong Choi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Theodore B.

letter,A generator for unique quantum random numbers based on vacuum states,"<p>Random numbers are a valuable component in diverse applications that range from simulations over gambling to cryptography. The quest for true randomness in these applications has engendered a large variety of different proposals for producing random numbers based on the foundational unpredictability of quantum mechanics. However, most approaches do not consider that a potential adversary could have knowledge about the generated numbers, so the numbers are not verifiably random and unique. Here we present a simple experimental setup based on homodyne measurements that uses the purity of a continuous-variable quantum vacuum state to generate unique random numbers. We use the intrinsic randomness in measuring the quadratures of a mode in the lowest energy vacuum state, which cannot be correlated to any other state. The simplicity of our source, combined with its verifiably unique randomness, are important attributes for achieving high-reliability, high-speed and low-cost quantum random number generators.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Guenther-Scharowsky-Strasse 1, Erlangen, D-91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Christian Gabriel"", "",\u00a0Christoffer Wittmann"", "",\u00a0Denis Sych"", "",\u00a0Ruifang Dong"", "",\u00a0Ulrik L.

letter,Time-of-flight measurement with femtosecond light pulses,"<p>The time-of-flight of light pulses has long been used as a direct measure of distance, but state-of-the-art measurement precision using conventional light pulses or microwaves peaks at only several hundreds of micrometres. Here, we improve the time-of-flight precision to the nanometre regime by timing femtosecond pulses through phase-locking control of the pulse repetition rate using the optical cross-correlation technique. Our experiment shows an Allan deviation of 117&#160;nm in measuring a 0.7-km distance in air at a sampling rate of 5&#160;ms once the pulse repetition is phase-locked, which reduces to 7&#160;nm as the averaging time increases to 1&#160;s. This enhanced capability is maintained at long range without periodic ambiguity, and is well suited to lidar applications such as geodetic surveying, range finders and absolute altimeters. This method could also be applied to future space missions involving formation-flying satellites for synthetic aperture imaging and remote experiments related to general relativity theory.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ultrafast Optics for Ultraprecision Group, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Science Town, Daejeon, 305-701, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Joohyung Lee"", "",\u00a0Young-Jin Kim"", "",\u00a0Keunwoo Lee"", "",\u00a0Sanghyun Lee"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Seung-Woo Kim""]}]",False,"[""Joohyung Lee"", ""Young-Jin Kim"", ""Keunwoo Lee"", ""Sanghyun Lee"", ""Seung-Woo Kim""]","Lee, J., Kim, Y., Lee, K. et al.

article,Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry with interacting photons,"<p>Five decades ago, Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) demonstrated that the angular size of stars can be measured by correlating the intensity fluctuations measured by two detectors at two different locations. Since then, non-local correlation measurements have become ubiquitous in many areas of physics and have also been applied, beyond photons, to electrons, matter waves and subatomic particles. An important assumption in HBT interferometry is that the particles do not interact on their way from the source to the detectors. However, this assumption is not always valid. Here, we study the effects of interactions on HBT interferometry by considering the propagation of light fields in a nonlinear medium that induces interactions between the photons. We show that interactions affect multipath interference, limiting the ability to extract information on the source. Nevertheless, we find that proper analysis of the intensity fluctuations can recover the size of the source, even in the presence of interactions.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Y.
