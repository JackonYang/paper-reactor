progress article,Optical arbitrary waveform generation,"<p>Optical arbitrary waveform generation will allow waveforms to be synthesized at optical frequencies but with the flexibility currently available at radiofrequencies. This technique is enabled by combining frequency comb technology, which produces trains of optical pulses with a well-defined frequency spectrum, with pulse shaping methods, which are used to transform a train of ultrashort pulses into an arbitrary waveform. To produce a waveform that fills time, the resolution of the shaper must match the repetition rate of the original pulse train, which in turn must have a comb spectrum that is locked to the shaper. Here, we review the current efforts towards achieving optical arbitrary waveform generation and discuss the possible applications of this technology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""JILA, National Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Colorado, Boulder, 80309-0440, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Steven T.

letter,100 mW deep-ultraviolet emission from aluminium-nitride-based quantum wells pumped by an electron beam,"<p>Ultraviolet light sources, represented by excimer and mercury lamps, are currently used for various applications, including water purification/sterilization, biotechnology, photolithography and surface modification. However, they have the disadvantages of limited portability, low emission efficiency and the presence of harmful constituents. Finding a compact, efficient and environmentally friendly alternative ultraviolet light source is therefore of considerable technological interest. Aluminium-nitride-based semiconductors show promise as materials for this purpose, but because of difficulties in controlling electronic conductivity, in light-emitting diodes are hampered by low external quantum efficiencies. Here, we use an electron-beam pumping technique, demonstrating an output of 100 mW and a record power efficiency of &#8764;40% from Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>N/AlN quantum wells emitting at &#8764;240 nm. This achievement is attributed to carrier confinement within the high-quality quantum wells, as well as the appropriate design of sample structures for electron-beam pumping, and may be a milestone in the path to realizing next-generation ultraviolet light sources with great ecological and economic benefits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takao Oto"", "",\u00a0Ryan G.

letter,Optical trapping of an ion,"<p>Isolating ions and atoms from the environment is essential in experiments on a quantum level. For decades, this has been achieved by trapping ions with radiofrequency fields and neutral particles with optical fields. Here we demonstrate the trapping of an ion by interaction with light. The lifetime in the optical trap is several milliseconds, allowing hundreds of oscillations in the optical potential, and could be enhanced by established methods. These results could form the starting point for combining the advantages of optical trapping and ions. Extending the approach to optical lattices could support developments in experimental quantum simulations. As well as simulating complex spin systems with trapped ions, a new class of quantum simulations could be enabled that combines atoms and ions in a common lattice (Cirac, J.I., personal communication; Zoller, P., personal communication). Furthermore, ions could be embedded into quantum degenerate gases, thereby avoiding the inevitable excess kinetic energy of ions in radiofrequency traps, which currently limits cold-chemistry experiments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Hans-Kopfermann-Stra\u00dfe 1, 85748 Garching, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Ch.

letter,Slow light on a chip via atomic quantum state control,"<p>The ability to slow down the propagation of light touches both fundamental aspects of light&#8211;matter interactions and practical applications in photonic communication and computation. Optical quantum interference can substantially reduce the speed of light while offering additional dramatic optical effects based on the ability to control electronic quantum states. Recent efforts are increasingly being directed towards harnessing these effects in integrated photonic structures. Here, we report the first demonstration of slow light and electromagnetically induced transparency in a self-contained, planar atomic spectroscopy chip. Using hot rubidium atoms in hollow-core waveguides, we demonstrate 44% optical transparency with a group index of 1,200, or more than sevenfold slower light than in photonic-crystal waveguides. Optical pulse delays of 16&#160;ns with a delay-bandwidth product of 0.8 are observed. This implementation of atomic quantum state control in integrated photonic structures will enable coherent photonics at ultralow power levels.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, California, 95064, USA"", ""authors"": [""Bin Wu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Holger Schmidt""]}, {""address"": ""Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Brigham Young University, Provo, 84602, Utah, USA"", ""authors"": [""John F.

article,Microscopy with self-reconstructing beams,"<p>Although self-reconstructing beams have been the focus of many scientific studies over the past decade, hardly anything is known about their propagation and self-healing behaviour in a three-dimensional, inhomogeneous medium. The controlled reduction of scattering and beam spreading would enable a new illumination concept for light microscopes, particularly for those designed to look deep into scattering tissue. By investigating three different classes of refractive index inhomogeneity, using two large glass spheres, a cluster of smaller spheres and a piece of human skin, respectively, we show that beam self-reconstruction is indeed possible. We demonstrate that a Bessel beam is unexpectedly robust against deflection at objects, and we define measures for self-reconstruction in this context. We present a prototype of a microscope with self-reconstructing beams (MISERB) and show that a holographically shaped, scanned Bessel beam not only reduces scattering artefacts, but also simultaneously increases image quality and penetration depth in dense media.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss), University of Freiburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Florian O.

article,Quantum transduction of telecommunications-band single photons from a quantum dot by frequency upconversion,"<p>Transducing non-classical states of light from one wavelength to another is required for integrating disparate quantum systems that take advantage of telecommunications-band photons for optical-fibre transmission of quantum information and near-visible, stationary systems for manipulation and storage. In addition, transducing a single-photon source at 1.3&#160;&#181;m to visible wavelengths would be integral to linear optical quantum computation because of near-infrared detection challenges. Recently, transduction at single-photon power levels has been accomplished through frequency upconversion, but it has yet to be demonstrated for a true single-photon source. Here, we transduce triggered single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot at 1.3&#160;&#181;m to 710&#160;nm with 21% (75%) total detection (internal conversion) efficiency. We demonstrate that the upconverted signal maintains the quantum character of the original light, yielding a second-order intensity correlation, g<sup>(2)</sup>(&#964;), that shows that the optical field is composed of single photons with g<sup>(2)</sup>(0)&#160;=&#160;0.165&#160;&lt;&#160;0.5.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, 20899, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Matthew T.

article,From quantum multiplexing to high-performance quantum networking,"<p>Quantum repeaters will be critical to quantum communication and quantum computation. Here, we describe a mechanism that permits the creation of entanglement between two qubits, connected by fibre, with probability arbitrarily close to one and in constant time. We show how this mechanism may be extended to ensure that the entanglement has high fidelity without compromising these properties. Finally, we describe how it may be used to construct a quantum repeater that is capable of creating a linear quantum network connecting two distant qubits with high fidelity. The communication rate is shown to be a function of the maximum distance between any two adjacent quantum repeaters rather than of the entire length of the network.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Informatics, 2-1-2 Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 101-8430, Japan"", ""authors"": [""W.
