review article,The attosecond nonlinear optics of bright coherent X-ray generation,"<p>The frequency doubling of laser light was one of the first new phenomena observed following the invention of the laser over 50 years ago. Since then, the quest to extend nonlinear optical upconversion to ever-shorter wavelengths has been a grand challenge in laser science. Two decades of research into high-order harmonic generation has recently uncovered several feasible routes for generating bright coherent X-ray beams using small-scale femtosecond lasers. The physics of this technique combines the microscopic attosecond science of atoms driven by intense laser fields with the macroscopic extreme nonlinear optics of phase matching, thus essentially realizing a coherent, tabletop version of the Roentgen X-ray tube.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""the Department of Physics and the NSF Engineering Research Center in Extreme Ultraviolet Science and Technology, JILA, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, 80309, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tenio Popmintchev"", "",\u00a0Ming-Chang Chen"", "",\u00a0Paul Arpin"", "",\u00a0Margaret M.

letter,Rewritable nanoscale oxide photodetector,"<p>Nanophotonic devices are designed to generate, guide or detect light using structures with nanoscale dimensions that are closely tied to their functionality. However, the integration of photonic nanostructures with electronic circuitry remains one of the most challenging aspects of device development. Here we report the development of rewritable nanoscale photodetectors created at the interface between LaAlO<sub>3</sub> and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>. Nanowire junctions with characteristic dimensions of 2&#8211;3&#160;nm are created using a reversible conductive atomic force microscope writing technique. These nanoscale devices exhibit remarkably high gain for their size, in part because of the large electric fields produced in the gap region. The photoconductive response is electric field-tunable and spans the visible-to-near-infrared regime.

letter,Fast high-resolution spectroscopy of dynamic continuous-wave laser sources,"<p>Time-resolved, high-accuracy and high-resolution spectroscopy of rapidly tuned continuous-wave lasers is critical to realizing their full potential for sensing, but is not possible with conventional spectrometers. We demonstrate a coherent dual-comb-based spectrometer capable of measuring continuous-wave optical waveforms at time resolutions of 30&#160;&#181;s and 320&#160;&#181;s over terahertz bandwidths. Within each time interval, the spectrometer returns the laser frequency spectrum with kilohertz absolute accuracy and time-bandwidth limited precision. Unlike etalon-based techniques, each measurement is independently calibrated, which allows for discontinuous source tuning between measurements and the characterization of arbitrary continuous-wave waveforms. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the technique, we measure a laser during a nonlinear scan over 28&#160;nm, a laser step-scanned over a 42-nm span containing several molecular absorption lines, a mechanically perturbed laser, and two lasers tuned simultaneously. Our approach should enable optimized waveforms for sensing applications including multispecies gas detection, coherent laser radar and optical metrology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, 80305, 325 Broadway, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""F.

letter,Robustness of bipartite Gaussian entangled beams propagating in lossy channels,"<p>Subtle quantum properties offer exciting new prospects in optical communications. For example, quantum entanglement enables the secure exchange of cryptographic keys and the distribution of quantum information by teleportation. Entangled bright beams of light are increasingly appealing for such tasks, because they enable the use of well-established classical communications techniques. However, quantum resources are fragile and are subject to decoherence by interaction with the environment. The unavoidable losses in the communication channel can lead to a complete destruction of entanglement, limiting the application of these states to quantum-communication protocols. We investigate the conditions under which this phenomenon takes place for the simplest case of two light beams, and analyse characteristics of states which are robust against losses. Our study sheds new light on the intriguing properties of quantum entanglement and how they may be harnessed for future applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Instituto de F\u00edsica, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Caixa Postal 66318, S\u00e3o Paulo, 05315-970, SP, Brazil"", ""authors"": [""F.

article,Temporal solitons and pulse compression in photonic crystal waveguides,"<p>Solitons are nonlinear waves that exhibit invariant or recurrent behaviour as they propagate. Precise control of dispersion and nonlinear effects governs soliton propagation and, through the formation of higher-order solitons, permits pulse compression. In recent years the development of photonic crystals&#8212;highly dispersive periodic dielectric media&#8212;has attracted a great deal of attention due to the facility to engineer and enhance both their nonlinear and dispersive effects. In this Article, we demonstrate the first experimental observations of optical solitons and pulse compression in &#8764;1-mm-long photonic crystal waveguides. Suppression of two-photon absorption in the GaInP material is crucial to these observations. Compression of 3-ps pulses to a minimum duration of 580 fs with a simultaneously low pulse energy of &#8764;20 pJ is achieved.

article,Real-space imaging of transient carrier dynamics by nanoscale pump–probe microscopy,"<p>Smaller and faster are key concepts underlying the progress of current nanoscience and nanotechnology. The development of a method of exploring the transient carrier dynamics in organized nanostructures with pinpoint accuracy is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present a new microscopy that enables real-space measurement of the spatial variation of ultrafast dynamics. It is a pulse-laser-combined scanning tunnelling microscopy with a novel delay-time modulation method based on a pulse-picking technique. A non-equilibrium carrier distribution is generated with ultrashort laser pulses, and its relaxation processes are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy using a pump&#8211;probe technique. We have directly analysed the recombination of excited carriers via the gap states associated with a cobalt nanoparticle/GaAs structure in real space.
