letter,Coherent terahertz control of antiferromagnetic spin waves,"<p>Ultrafast charge and spin excitations in the elusive terahertz regime of the electromagnetic spectrum play a pivotal role in condensed matter. The electric field of free-space terahertz pulses has provided a direct gateway to manipulating the motion of charges on the femtosecond timescale. Here, we complement this process by showing that the magnetic component of intense terahertz transients enables ultrafast control of the spin degree of freedom. Single-cycle terahertz pulses switch on and off coherent spin waves in antiferromagnetic NiO at frequencies as high as 1&#160;THz. An optical probe pulse with a duration of 8&#160;fs follows the terahertz-induced magnetic dynamics directly in the time domain and verifies that the terahertz field addresses spins selectively by means of the Zeeman interaction. This concept provides a universal ultrafast means to control previously inaccessible magnetic excitations in the electronic ground state.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Center for Applied Photonics, University of Konstanz, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe 10, Konstanz, 78464, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Tobias Kampfrath"", "",\u00a0Alexander Sell"", "",\u00a0Gregor Klatt"", "",\u00a0Alexej Pashkin"", "",\u00a0Sebastian M\u00e4hrlein"", "",\u00a0Thomas Dekorsy"", "",\u00a0Alfred Leitenstorfer"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Rupert Huber""]}, {""address"": ""Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Faradayweg 4-6, Berlin, 14195, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Tobias Kampfrath"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Martin Wolf""]}, {""address"": ""FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF), Science Park 104, Amsterdam, 1098 XG, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Tobias Kampfrath""]}, {""address"": ""Helmholtz-Institut f\u00fcr Strahlen- und Kernphysik, Nu\u00dfallee 14-16, Bonn, 53115, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Manfred Fiebig""]}]",False,"[""Tobias Kampfrath"", ""Alexander Sell"", ""Gregor Klatt"", ""Alexej Pashkin"", ""Sebastian M\u00e4hrlein"", ""Thomas Dekorsy"", ""Martin Wolf"", ""Manfred Fiebig"", ""Alfred Leitenstorfer"", ""Rupert Huber""]","Kampfrath, T., Sell, A., Klatt, G. et al.

letter,An array of integrated atom–photon junctions,"<p>Photonic chips that integrate optical elements on a single device can process vast amounts of information rapidly. A new branch of this technology involves coupling light to cold atoms or Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates, the quantum nature of which provides a basis for new information-processing methods. The use of optical waveguides gives the light a small cross-section, making coupling to atoms efficient. In this Letter, we present the first waveguide chip designed to address a Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate along a row of independent junctions, which are separated by only 10&#160;&#181;m and have large atom&#8211;photon coupling. We describe a fully integrated, scalable design, and demonstrate 11 junctions working as intended, using a low-density cold atom cloud with as little as one atom on average in any one junction.

letter,Scale-free optics and diffractionless waves in nanodisordered ferroelectrics,"<p>Wavelength rigidly fixes the diffraction that distorts waves during propagation, and poses fundamental limits to imaging, microscopy and communication. This distortion can be avoided by using waveguides or nonlinearity to produce solitons. In both cases, however, diffraction is only compensated, so the wavelength still imposes rigid laws on wave shape, size and soliton intensity. Nonlinearity, in turn, can introduce new spatial scales. In principle, if one is able to identify a nonlinearity that introduces an intensity-independent scale that cancels the wavelength, &#8216;scale-free&#8217; propagation can occur. In this regime, diffraction ceases, and waveforms will naturally propagate without distortion, forming solitons of any size and intensity, even arbitrarily low. Here we provide the first experimental evidence of scale-free optical propagation in supercooled copper-doped KTN:Li, a recently developed out-of-equilibrium ferroelectric. This demonstrates that diffraction can be cancelled, and not merely compensated, thus leading to a completely new paradigm for ultraresolved imaging and microscopy.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dell'Informazione, Universita' dell'Aquila, L'Aquila, 67100, Italy"", ""authors"": [""E.

letter,Entanglement-enhanced measurement of a completely unknown optical phase,"<p>Precise interferometric measurement is vital to many scientific and technological applications. Using quantum entanglement allows interferometric sensitivity that surpasses the shot-noise limit (SNL). To date, experiments demonstrating entanglement-enhanced sub-SNL interferometry, and most theoretical treatments, have addressed the goal of increasing signal-to-noise ratios. This is suitable for phase-sensing&#8212;detecting small variations about an already known phase. However, it is not sufficient for ab initio phase-estimation&#8212;making a self-contained determination of a phase that is initially completely unknown within the interval [0, 2&#960;). Both tasks are important, but not equivalent. To move from the sensing regime to the ab initio estimation regime requires a non-trivial phase-estimation algorithm. Here, we implement a &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; approach, optimally utilizing the available entangled photon states, obtained by post-selection. This enables us to demonstrate sub-SNL ab initio estimation of an unknown phase by entanglement-enhanced optical interferometry.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre for Quantum Computer Technology, Centre for Quantum Dynamics, Griffith University, Brisbane, 4111, Australia"", ""authors"": [""G.

article,Stable optical lift,"<p>We have predicted and observed an optical analogue of aerodynamic lift, in which a cambered refractive object with differently shaped top and bottom surfaces experiences a transverse lift force when placed in a uniform stream of light. A semi-cylindrical rod is found to automatically torque into a stable angle of attack, and then exhibit uniform motion. We have experimentally verified this using a micrometer-scale &#8216;lightfoil&#8217; which was fabricated using photolithographic techniques, immersed in water and illuminated with milliwatt-scale laser light. Unlike optical tweezers, an intensity gradient is not required to achieve a transverse force. Many rods may therefore be lifted simultaneously in a single quasi-uniform beam of light. We propose using optical lift to power micromachines, transport microscopic particles in a liquid, or to improve the design of solar sails for interstellar space travel.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Chester F.

article,Coherent coupling between distant excitons revealed by two-dimensional nonlinear hyperspectral imaging,"<p>Coherent coupling between distant two-level systems is a fundamental process in several physical contexts, from natural photosynthesis to quantum-information processing, where it enables two-qubit operations. For quantum information, qubits based on electronic degrees of freedom in a solid-state matrix are sensible candidates for scalable, integrated implementations. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying coherent coupling in solids is therefore an essential step in the development of such technology. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a long-range coherent coupling mechanism between individual localized excitons in a 5&#160;nm GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well, introducing the novel tool of two-dimensional nonlinear coherent hyperspectral imaging. The coupling is shown to arise due to a biexcitonic renormalization, rather than a transition dipole (F&#246;rster) interaction. The long-range nature of the coupling is attributed to the existence of spatially extended exciton states up to the micrometre range, which are admixed in the biexciton state, as revealed in nonlinear imaging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University, The Parade, CF24 3AA, Cardiff, UK"", ""authors"": [""J.
