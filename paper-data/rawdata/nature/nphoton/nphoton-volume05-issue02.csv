review article,Antennas for light,"<p>Optical antennas are devices that convert freely propagating optical radiation into localized energy, and vice versa. They enable the control and manipulation of optical fields at the nanometre scale, and hold promise for enhancing the performance and efficiency of photodetection, light emission and sensing. Although many of the properties and parameters of optical antennas are similar to their radiowave and microwave counterparts, they have important differences resulting from their small size and the resonant properties of metal nanostructures. This Review summarizes the physical properties of optical antennas, provides a summary of some of the most important recent developments in the field, discusses the potential applications and identifies the future challenges and opportunities.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Optics, University of Rochester, Rochester, 14627, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Lukas Novotny""]}, {""address"": ""Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies Fot\u00f2niques, Mediterranean Technology Park, 08860 Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Niek van Hulst""]}, {""address"": ""Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats, Barcelona, 08015, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Niek van Hulst""]}]",False,"[""Lukas Novotny"", ""Niek van Hulst""]","Novotny, L., van Hulst, N.

letter,Lasing oscillation in a three-dimensional photonic crystal nanocavity with a complete bandgap,"<p>Photonic crystals have been extensively used in the control and manipulation of photons in engineered electromagnetic environments provided by means of photonic bandgap effects. These effects are key to realizing future optoelectronic devices, including highly efficient lasers. To date, lasers based on photonic crystal cavities have been exclusively demonstrated in two-dimensional photonic crystal geometries. However, full confinement of photons and control of their interaction with materials can only be achieved with the use of three-dimensional photonic crystals with complete photonic bandgaps. We demonstrate, for the first time, the realization of lasing oscillation in a three-dimensional photonic crystal nanocavity. The laser is constructed by coupling a cavity mode exhibiting the highest quality factor yet achieved (&#8764;38,500) with quantum dots. This achievement provides means for exploring the physics of light&#8211;matter interactions in a nanocavity&#8211;single quantum dot coupling system in which both photons and electrons are confined in three dimensions, as well as for realizing three-dimensional integrated photonic circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Nano Quantum Information Electronics, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro, 153-8505, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Aniwat Tandaechanurat"", "",\u00a0Satomi Ishida"", "",\u00a0Denis Guimard"", "",\u00a0Masahiro Nomura"", "",\u00a0Satoshi Iwamoto"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yasuhiko Arakawa""]}]",False,"[""Aniwat Tandaechanurat"", ""Satomi Ishida"", ""Denis Guimard"", ""Masahiro Nomura"", ""Satoshi Iwamoto"", ""Yasuhiko Arakawa""]","Tandaechanurat, A., Ishida, S., Guimard, D. et al.

letter,Single-molecule imaging by optical absorption,"<p>To date, optical studies of single molecules at room temperature have relied on the use of materials with high fluorescence quantum yield combined with efficient spectral rejection of background light. To extend single-molecule studies to a much larger pallet of substances that absorb but do not fluoresce, scientists have explored the photothermal effect, interferometry, direct attenuation and stimulated emission. Indeed, very recently, three groups have succeeded in achieving single-molecule sensitivity in absorption. Here, we apply modulation-free transmission measurements known from absorption spectrometers to image single molecules under ambient conditions both in the emissive and strongly quenched states. We arrive at quantitative values for the absorption cross-section of single molecules at different wavelengths and thereby set the ground for single-molecule absorption spectroscopy. Our work has important implications for research ranging from absorption and infrared spectroscopy to sensing of unlabelled proteins at the single-molecule level.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, ETH Zurich, Zurich, 8093, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Michele Celebrano"", "",\u00a0Philipp Kukura"", "",\u00a0Alois Renn"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Vahid Sandoghdar""]}]",False,"[""Michele Celebrano"", ""Philipp Kukura"", ""Alois Renn"", ""Vahid Sandoghdar""]","Celebrano, M., Kukura, P., Renn, A. et al.

letter,Sequential femtosecond X-ray imaging,"<p>Recording a &#8216;molecular movie&#8217; with atomic spatial resolution on the femtosecond timescale set by atomic motion can be considered the ultimate goal of dynamic real-space imaging. Free-electron X-ray lasers, with their (sub)nanometre wavelength, femtosecond pulse duration and high brilliance, fuel the hope that this may ultimately become possible. Single-shot still pictures with sub-100&#160;nm resolution achieved during femtosecond exposures have recently been demonstrated. A femtosecond time-lapse movie requires a sequence of independent images taken with a controllable time delay. As a key step towards achieving a molecular movie, we demonstrate a holographic imaging approach capable of recording two fully independent images with a variable time delay over the entire femtosecond regime. The concept overcomes the fundamental readout time limitations of two-dimensional area detectors, as two subsequent X-ray holograms of a sample can be superimposed within one detector exposure and yet be unambiguously disentangled to reconstruct two independent images.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Optik und Atomare Physik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Stra\u00dfe des 17.

article,Highly specific label-free molecular imaging with spectrally tailored excitation-stimulated Raman scattering (STE-SRS) microscopy,"<p>Label-free microscopy that has chemical contrast and high acquisition speeds up to video rates has recently been made possible using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. SRS imaging offers high sensitivity, but the spectral specificity of the original narrowband implementation is limited, making it difficult to distinguish chemical species with overlapping Raman bands. Here, we present a highly specific imaging method that allows mapping of a particular chemical species in the presence of interfering species, based on tailored multiplex excitation of its vibrational spectrum. This is implemented by spectral modulation of a broadband pump beam at a high frequency (&gt;1&#160;MHz), allowing detection of the SRS signal of the narrowband Stokes beam with high sensitivity. Using the scheme, we demonstrate quantification of cholesterol in the presence of lipids, and real-time three-dimensional spectral imaging of protein, stearic acid and oleic acid in live Caenorhabditis elegans.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Christian W.

Here, a laser spectroscopy based on nonlinear nanobubble-related photothermal and photoacoustic phenomena is presented. It shows ultrasharp resonances and dips up to a few nanometres wide in broad plasmonic spectra of nanoparticles. It also demonstrates narrowing of absorption spectra of dyes and cellular chromophores, as well as an increase in the sensitivity and resolution of the spectral hole-burning technique. This approach can permits the study of nonlinear plasmonics at a level of resolution beyond the spectral limits, the identification of weakly absorbing spectral holes, spectral optimization of photothermal nanotherapy, measurements of tiny red and blue resonance shifts in nanoplasmonic sensors, the use of negative contrast in photoacoustic technique, multispectral imaging and multicolour cytometry.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Phillips Classic Laser and Nanomedicine Laboratories, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, 4301 West Markham Street, Little Rock, 72205, Arkansas, USA"", ""authors"": [""Vladimir P.

article,Experimental measurement-based quantum computing beyond the cluster-state model,"<p>The paradigm of measurement-based quantum computation opens new experimental avenues to realizing a quantum computer, and also deepens our understanding of quantum physics. Measurement-based quantum computation originates with a highly entangled universal resource state. For years, clusters states have been the only known universal resources. Surprisingly, a novel framework, namely quantum computation in correlation space, has opened a new route to implementing measurement-based quantum computation based on quantum states having entanglement properties, which differ from cluster states. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of every building block of such a model. With four-qubit and six-qubit states, which are not in the cluster-state category, we have realized a universal set of single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates and also Deutsch's algorithm. As well as being of fundamental interest, our experiment proves, in principle, the feasibility of universal measurement-based quantum computation without the use of cluster states, which represents a new approach towards the realization of a quantum computer.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Wei-Bo Gao"", "",\u00a0Xing-Can Yao"", "",\u00a0He Lu"", "",\u00a0Ping Xu"", "",\u00a0Tao Yang"", "",\u00a0Chao-Yang Lu"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ao Chen"", "",\u00a0Zeng-Bing Chen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik und Quanteninformation, \u00d6sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Technikerstra\u00dfe 21A, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Jian-Ming Cai""]}, {""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr theoretische Physik, Universit\u00e4t Innsbruck, Technikerstra\u00dfe 25, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Jian-Ming Cai""]}, {""address"": ""Physikalisches Institut, Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Philosophenweg 12, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Jian-Wei Pan""]}]",False,"[""Wei-Bo Gao"", ""Xing-Can Yao"", ""Jian-Ming Cai"", ""He Lu"", ""Ping Xu"", ""Tao Yang"", ""Chao-Yang Lu"", ""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Zeng-Bing Chen"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Gao, W., Yao, X., Cai, J. et al.
