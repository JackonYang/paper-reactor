letter,High-resolution broad-bandwidth Fourier-transform absorption spectroscopy in the VUV range down to 40 nm,"<p>Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) high-resolution absorption spectroscopy is a unique tool for the study of gas-phase atomic and molecular electronic structure. To date, it has been performed by using lasers or synchrotron radiation-based grating spectrometers, but none of these techniques can offer simultaneous high resolution, wavelength accuracy and broad tunability. The only technique combining these three important features is Fourier-transform spectroscopy, but this is limited to the mid-UV range (down to 140&#160;nm; ref.&#160;) because of a lack of beamsplitters. Here, we present a new instrument based on a wavefront-division scanning interferometer, applied for the first time to the VUV range. This instrument, coupled to the DESIRS beamline at synchrotron SOLEIL, covers a broad range of wavelengths (typically 7%, adjustable in the 250&#8211;40 nm range), a resolving power of &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>, an extrinsic absolute wavelength accuracy of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;7</sup> and a high signal-to-noise ratio.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Synchrotron Soleil, Orme des Merisiers St Aubin BP 48, GIF sur Yvette Cedex, 91192, France"", ""authors"": [""Nelson de Oliveira"", "",\u00a0Mourad Roudjane"", "",\u00a0Denis Joyeux"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Laurent Nahon""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratoire Charles Fabry de l'Institut d'Optique, RD 128, Campus Polytechnique, Palaiseau Cedex, 91127, France"", ""authors"": [""Denis Joyeux"", "",\u00a0Daniel Phalippou"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jean-Claude Rodier""]}]",False,"[""Nelson de Oliveira"", ""Mourad Roudjane"", ""Denis Joyeux"", ""Daniel Phalippou"", ""Jean-Claude Rodier"", ""Laurent Nahon""]","de Oliveira, N., Roudjane, M., Joyeux, D. et al.

letter,Time-reversed ultrasonically encoded optical focusing into scattering media,"<p>Light focusing plays a central role in biomedical imaging, manipulation and therapy. In scattering media, direct light focusing becomes infeasible beyond one transport mean free path. All previous methods used to overcome this diffusion limit lack a practical internal &#8216;guide star&#8217;. Here, we propose and experimentally validate a novel concept called time-reversed ultrasonically encoded (TRUE) optical focusing to deliver light into any dynamically defined location inside a scattering medium. First, diffused coherent light is encoded by a focused ultrasonic wave to provide a virtual internal guide star. Only the encoded light is time-reversed and transmitted back to the ultrasonic focus. The time-reversed ultrasonically encoded optical focus&#8212;defined by the ultrasonic wave&#8212;is unaffected by multiple scattering of light. Such focusing is particularly desirable in biological tissue, where ultrasonic scattering is &#8764;1,000 times weaker than optical scattering.

letter,Making optical atomic clocks more stable with 10−16-level laser stabilization,"<p>The superb precision of an atomic clock is derived from its stability. Atomic clocks based on optical (rather than microwave) frequencies are attractive because of their potential for high stability, which scales with operational frequency. Nevertheless, optical clocks have not yet realized this vast potential, due in large part to limitations of the laser used to excite the atomic resonance. To address this problem, we demonstrate a cavity-stabilized laser system with a reduced thermal noise floor, exhibiting a fractional frequency instability of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>. We use this laser as a stable optical source in a ytterbium optical lattice clock to resolve an ultranarrow 1&#160;Hz linewidth for the 518&#160;THz clock transition. With the stable laser source and the signal-to-noise ratio afforded by the ytterbium optical clock, we dramatically reduce key stability limitations of the clock, and make measurements consistent with a clock instability of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Standards and Technology, 325 Broadway, Boulder, 80305, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Y.

letter,Few-femtosecond timing at fourth-generation X-ray light sources,"<p>Fourth-generation X-ray light sources are being developed to deliver laser-like X-ray pulses at intensities and/or repetition rates that are beyond the reach of table-top devices. An important class of experiments at these new facilities comprises pump&#8211;probe experiments, which are designed to investigate chemical reactions and processes occurring on the molecular or even atomic level, and on the timescale of a few femtoseconds. Good progress has been made towards the generation of ultrashort X-ray pulses (for example, at FLASH or LCLS), but experiments suffer from the intrinsic timing jitter between the X-ray pulses and external laser sources. In this Letter, we present a new approach that provides few-femtosecond temporal resolution. Our method uses coherent terahertz radiation generated at the end of the X-ray undulator by the same electron bunch that emits the X-ray pulse. It can therefore be applied at any advanced light source working with ultrashort electron bunches and undulators.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""HASYLAB/DESY, Notkestrasse 85, Hamburg, 22607, Germany"", ""authors"": [""F.

letter,A planar dielectric antenna for directional single-photon emission and near-unity collection efficiency,"<p>Single emitters have been considered as sources of single photons in various contexts, including cryptography, quantum computation, spectroscopy and metrology. The success of these applications will crucially rely on the efficient directional emission of photons into well-defined modes. To accomplish high efficiency, researchers have investigated microcavities at cryogenic temperatures, photonic nanowires and near-field coupling to metallic nano-antennas. However, despite impressive progress, the existing realizations substantially fall short of unity collection efficiency. Here, we report on a theoretical and experimental study of a dielectric planar antenna, which uses a layered structure to tailor the angular emission of a single oriented molecule. We demonstrate a collection efficiency of 96% using a microscope objective at room temperature and obtain record detection rates of &#8764;50 MHz. Our scheme is wavelength-insensitive and can be readily extended to other solid-state emitters such as colour centres and semiconductor quantum dots.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratory of Physical Chemistry and optETH, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, CH-8093, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""K.

article,Nanolasers grown on silicon,"<p>The integration of optical interconnects with silicon-based electronics can address the growing limitations facing chip-scale data transport as microprocessors become progressively faster. However, until now, material lattice mismatch and incompatible growth temperatures have fundamentally limited monolithic integration of lasers onto silicon substrates. Here, we use a novel growth scheme to overcome this roadblock and directly grow on-chip InGaAs nanopillar lasers, demonstrating the potency of bottom-up nano-optoelectronic integration. Unique helically propagating cavity modes are used to strongly confine light within subwavelength nanopillars despite the low refractive index contrast between InGaAs and silicon. These modes therefore provide an avenue for engineering on-chip nanophotonic devices such as lasers. Nanopillar lasers are as-grown on silicon, offer tiny footprints and scalability, and are thus particularly suited to high-density optoelectronics. They may ultimately form the basis of future monolithic light sources needed to bridge the existing gap between photonic and electronic circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and Applied Science and Technology Group, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Roger Chen"", "",\u00a0Thai-Truong D.

article,Full-colour quantum dot displays fabricated by transfer printing,"<p>Light-emitting diodes with quantum dot luminophores show promise in the development of next-generation displays, because quantum dot luminophores demonstrate high quantum yields, extremely narrow emission, spectral tunability and high stability, among other beneficial characteristics. However, the inability to achieve size-selective quantum dot patterning by conventional methods hinders the realization of full-colour quantum dot displays. Here, we report the first demonstration of a large-area, full-colour quantum dot display, including in flexible form, using optimized quantum dot films, and with control of the nano-interfaces and carrier behaviour. Printed quantum dot films exhibit excellent morphology, well-ordered quantum dot structure and clearly defined interfaces. These characteristics are achieved through the solvent-free transfer of quantum dot films and the compact structure of the quantum dot networks. Significant enhancements in charge transport/balance in the quantum dot layer improve electroluminescent performance. A method using plasmonic coupling is also suggested to further enhance luminous efficiency. The results suggest routes towards creating large-scale optoelectronic devices in displays, solid-state lighting and photovoltaics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Frontier Research Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Kyunggi-do, 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Tae-Ho Kim"", "",\u00a0Kyung-Sang Cho"", "",\u00a0Eun Kyung Lee"", "",\u00a0Sang Jin Lee"", "",\u00a0Byoung Lyong Choi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jong Min Kim""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-747, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jungseok Chae"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Young Kuk""]}, {""address"": ""Display Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Kyunggi-do, 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jung Woo Kim"", "",\u00a0Do Hwan Kim"", "",\u00a0Jang-Yeon Kwon"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sang Yoon Lee""]}, {""address"": ""Electrical Engineering Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB3 0FA, UK"", ""authors"": [""Gehan Amaratunga""]}, {""address"": ""Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Kyunggi-do, 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Kinam Kim""]}]",False,"[""Tae-Ho Kim"", ""Kyung-Sang Cho"", ""Eun Kyung Lee"", ""Sang Jin Lee"", ""Jungseok Chae"", ""Jung Woo Kim"", ""Do Hwan Kim"", ""Jang-Yeon Kwon"", ""Gehan Amaratunga"", ""Sang Yoon Lee"", ""Byoung Lyong Choi"", ""Young Kuk"", ""Jong Min Kim"", ""Kinam Kim""]","Kim, T., Cho, K., Lee, E. et al.
