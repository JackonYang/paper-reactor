review article,The Casimir effect in microstructured geometries,"<p>In 1948, Hendrik Casimir predicted that a generalized version of van der Waals forces would arise between two metal plates due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. These forces become significant in micromechanical systems at submicrometre scales, such as in the adhesion between movable parts. The Casimir force, through a close connection to classical photonics, can depend strongly on the shapes and compositions of the objects, stimulating a decades-long search for geometries in which the force behaves very differently from the monotonic attractive force first predicted by Casimir. Recent theoretical and experimental developments have led to a new understanding of the force in complex microstructured geometries, including through recent theoretical predictions of Casimir repulsion between vacuum-separated metals, the stable suspension of objects and unusual non-additive and temperature effects, as well as experimental observations of repulsion in fluids, non-additive forces in nanotrench surfaces and the influence of new material choices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alejandro W.

review article,Advances in quantum metrology,"<p>The statistical error in any estimation can be reduced by repeating the measurement and averaging the results. The central limit theorem implies that the reduction is proportional to the square root of the number of repetitions. Quantum metrology is the use of quantum techniques such as entanglement to yield higher statistical precision than purely classical approaches. In this Review, we analyse some of the most promising recent developments of this research field and point out some of the new experiments. We then look at one of the major new trends of the field: analyses of the effects of noise and experimental imperfections.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NEST, Scuola Normale Superiore and Istituto Nanoscienze-CNR, piazza dei Cavalieri 7, Pisa, I-56126, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Vittorio Giovannetti""]}, {""address"": ""Research Lab of Electronics and Deptartment of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Seth Lloyd""]}, {""address"": ""Dip.

letter,Hybrid semiconductor-atomic interface: slowing down single photons from a quantum dot,"<p>Hybrid interfaces between semiconductor quantum dots and atomic systems could be of potential fundamental and technological interest, because they can combine the advantages of both constituents. Semiconductor quantum dots are tunable and deterministic sources of single and entangled photons. Atomic vapours are widely used as slow-light media and quantum memories. Merging both systems could enable the storage of quantum dot emission&#8212;an important step towards the implementation of quantum memories and quantum repeaters. Here, we show a hybrid semiconductor&#8211;atomic interface for slowing down single photons emitted from a single quantum dot. We use a double absorption resonance in rubidium vapour to create a slow-light medium in which a single photon is stored for 15 times its temporal width. Our result is the first demonstration of non-classical light storage, where single photons are generated on demand from a semiconductor source.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft, Delft University of Technology, Delft, 2628CJ, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""N.

letter,Optofluidic modulator based on peristaltic nematogen microflows,"<p>Nematogens rotate by the application of external fields, thereby enabling optical modulation. This principle has had a profound impact on our daily lives through the plethora of liquid-crystal displays in use around us. However, the wider use of nematic liquid crystals, particularly in microdisplays and information processing, has been hampered by their slow response times. In nematogens, rotational and translational molecular motions are coupled, so flow is inevitably linked with optical modulation. This linkage motivated us to fuse microfluidics with anisotropic liquids and introduce an optofluidic modulator that exhibits a submillisecond (250&#160;&#181;s) symmetric response and can operate at frequencies up to 1&#160;kHz. The modulator is based on peristaltic nematogen microflows realized in polydimethylsiloxane microfluidics. The latter simultaneously permits peristalsis by means of elastomeric deformation, nematogen alignment and rapid prototyping through cast-moulding. Together with large-scale, vertical integration and piezoelectric nanotechnologies, this optofluidic paradigm can enable high-density and three-dimensional architectures of fast modulators.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optics Laboratory, School of Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""J.

letter,Observation of the inverse Doppler effect in negative-index materials at optical frequencies,"<p>The Doppler effect is a fundamental frequency shift phenomenon that occurs whenever a wave source and an observer are moving with respect to one another. It has well-established applications in astrophotonics, biological diagnostics, weather and aircraft radar systems, velocimetry and vibrometry. The counterintuitive inverse Doppler effect was theoretically predicted in 1968 by Veselago in negative-index materials. However, because of the tremendous challenges of frequency shift measurements inside such materials, most investigations of the inverse Doppler effect have been limited to theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. Indirect experimental measurements have been conducted only in nonlinear transmission lines at &#8764;1&#8211;2 GHz (ref.) and in acoustic media at 1&#8211;3&#160;kHz (ref.&#160;). The inverse Doppler shift at optical frequencies was demonstrated in an acousto-optic modulator using a fibre Bragg grating. Here, we report the first experimental observation of the inverse Doppler shift at an optical frequency (&#955;&#160;=&#160;10.6&#160;&#181;m) by refracting a laser beam in a photonic-crystal prism that has the properties of a negative-index material.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Shanghai Key Lab of Contemporary Optical System, Optical Electronic Information and Computer Engineering College, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200093, China"", ""authors"": [""Jiabi Chen"", "",\u00a0Yan Wang"", "",\u00a0Tao Geng"", "",\u00a0Lie Feng"", "",\u00a0Wei Qian"", "",\u00a0Bingming Liang"", "",\u00a0Xuanxiong Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Songlin Zhuang""]}, {""address"": ""College of Physics and Communication Electronics, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, China"", ""authors"": [""Yan Wang""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Micro-Photonics and CUDOS, Swinburne University of Technology, John Street Hawthorn, Victoria, 3122, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Baohua Jia"", "",\u00a0Xiangping Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Min Gu""]}]",False,"[""Jiabi Chen"", ""Yan Wang"", ""Baohua Jia"", ""Tao Geng"", ""Xiangping Li"", ""Lie Feng"", ""Wei Qian"", ""Bingming Liang"", ""Xuanxiong Zhang"", ""Min Gu"", ""Songlin Zhuang""]","Chen, J., Wang, Y., Jia, B. et al.

letter,Lensless X-ray imaging in reflection geometry,"<p>Lensless X-ray imaging techniques such as coherent diffraction imaging and ptychography, and Fourier transform holography can provide time-resolved, diffraction-limited images. Nearly all examples of these techniques have focused on transmission geometry, restricting the samples and reciprocal spaces that can be investigated. We report a lensless X-ray technique developed for imaging in Bragg and small-angle scattering geometries, which may also find application in transmission geometries. We demonstrate this by imaging a nanofabricated pseudorandom binary structure in small-angle reflection geometry. The technique can be used with extended objects, places no restriction on sample size, and requires no additional sample masking. The realization of X-ray lensless imaging in reflection geometry opens up the possibility of single-shot imaging of surfaces in thin films, buried interfaces in magnetic multilayers, organic photovoltaic and field-effect transistor devices, or Bragg planes in a single crystal.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""S.
