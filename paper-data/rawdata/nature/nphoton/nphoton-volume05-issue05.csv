review article,Exciton–polariton light–semiconductor coupling effects,"<p>The integrated absorption of an excitonic resonance is a measure of a semiconductor's coupling to an optical field. The concept of an exciton&#8211;polariton expresses the non-perturbative coupling between the electromagnetic field and the optically induced matter polarization. Ways to alter this coupling include confining the light in optical cavities and localizing the excitonic wavefunction in quantum wells and dots, which is illustrated by quantum strong coupling between a single dot and an optical nanocavity. Positioning quantum wells in periodic or quasiperiodic lattices with spacing close to a half wavelength results in pronounced modifications to the light transmission. Light&#8211;matter coupling can also be used to generate and interrogate an exciton population, for example by the recently developed technique of absorbing terahertz radiation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""College of Optical Sciences, The University of Arizona, 1630 E.

letter,Nanofocusing of mid-infrared energy with tapered transmission lines,"<p>Mid-infrared radiation allows the analysis of a wide range of different material properties, including chemical composition and the structure of matter (Gutberlet in Science 324:1545, 2009, Li in Nature Phys. 4:532, 2008). Infrared spectroscopy is therefore an essential analytical tool in many sciences and technologies. The diffraction limit, however, challenges the study of individual molecules and nanostructures, as well as the development of highly integrated mid-infrared optical devices (Soref in Nature Photon. 4:495, 2010). Here, we experimentally demonstrate mid-infrared nanofocusing by propagating a mid-infrared surface wave along a tapered two-wire transmission line. The tapering results in a compression of the electromagnetic energy carried by the surface wave. By using infrared vector near-field microscopy (Schnell et al. in Nano Lett. 10:3524, 2010, Olmon in Phys. Rev. Lett. 105:167403, 2010), we directly visualize the evolution of the energy compression into a nanoscale confined infrared spot with a diameter of 60&#160;nm (&#955;/150) at the taper apex. Our work opens the way to the development of chemical and biological sensing tools based on infrared surface waves, including miniaturized spectrometers and lab-on-a-chip integrated (bio)sensors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CIC nanoGUNE Consolider, 20018 Donostia \u2013 San Sebastian, Spain"", ""authors"": [""M.

letter,Frequency comparison of optical lattice clocks beyond the Dick limit,"<p>The supreme accuracy of atomic clocks (Rosenband in Science 319:1808, 2008) relies on the universality of atomic transition frequencies. The stability of a clock, meanwhile, measures how quickly the clock's statistical uncertainties are reduced. The ultimate measure of stability is provided by the quantum projection noise (Itano in Phys. Rev. A 47:3554, 1993), which improves as 1/&#8730;N by measuring N uncorrelated atoms. Quantum projection noise limited stabilities have been demonstrated in caesium clocks (Santarelli in Phys. Rev. Lett. 82:4619, 1999) and in single-ion optical clocks (Peik et al. in J. Phys. B 39:145, 2006, Chou et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 104:070802, 2010), where the quantum noise overwhelms the Dick effect (Santarelli in IEEE Trans. Ultrason. Ferroelectr. Freq. Control 45:887, 1998) attributed to local oscillator noise. Here, we demonstrate a synchronous frequency comparison of two optical lattice clocks using <sup>87</sup>Sr and <sup>88</sup>Sr atoms (Akatsuka et al. in Nature Phys. 4:954, 2008), respectively, for which the Allan standard deviation reached 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;17</sup> in an averaging time of 1,600&#160;s by cancelling out the Dick effect to approach the quantum projection noise limit. The scheme demonstrates the advantage of using a large number (N&#160;&#8776;&#160;1,000) of atoms in optical clocks and paves the way to investigating the inherent uncertainties of clocks and relativistic geodesy (Chou et al. in Science 329:1630, 2010) on a timescale of tens of minutes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8656, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Masao Takamoto"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hidetoshi Katori""]}, {""address"": ""CREST and ERATO Innovative Space-Time Project, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8656, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Masao Takamoto"", "",\u00a0Tetsushi Takano"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hidetoshi Katori""]}, {""address"": ""Photon Science Centre, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8656, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Tetsushi Takano""]}]",False,"[""Masao Takamoto"", ""Tetsushi Takano"", ""Hidetoshi Katori""]","Takamoto, M., Takano, T. & Katori, H.

letter,Ultralow-threshold electrically pumped quantum-dot photonic-crystal nanocavity laser,"<p>Efficient, low-threshold and compact semiconductor laser sources are under investigation for many applications in high-speed communications, information processing and optical interconnects. The best edge-emitting and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers have thresholds on the order of 100&#160;&#181;A (refs&#160;1, 2), but dissipate too much power to be practical for many applications, particularly optical interconnects (Miller in Proc.

Am. B 27:B1, 2010); however, to be practical, techniques to electrically pump these structures must be developed. Here, we demonstrate a quantum-dot photonic-crystal nanocavity laser in gallium arsenide pumped by a lateral p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction formed by ion implantation. Continuous-wave lasing is observed at temperatures up to 150&#160;K.

Rev. A 80:045802, 2009) and sensing (Balasubramanian in Nature 455:648, 2008). As individual quantum bits, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond are among the most promising solid-state systems identified to date, because of their long-lived electron and nuclear spin coherence and capability for individual optical initialization, readout and information storage (Jelezko in Phys. Rev. Lett. 93:130501, 2004, Balasubramanian in Nature Mater. 8:383, 2009, Santori in Phys. Rev. Lett. 97:247401, 2006, Buckley et al. in Science 330:1212, 2010, Gurudev Dutt in Science 316:1312, 2007). The major outstanding hurdle lies in interconnecting many nitrogen vacancies for large-scale computation. One of the most promising approaches in this regard is to couple them to optical resonators, which can be further interconnected in a photonic network (Cabrillo et al. in Phys. Rev. A 59:1025, 1999, Childress et al. in Phys. Rev. A 72:052330, 2005, Togan in Nature 466:730, 2010). Here, we demonstrate coupling of the zero-phonon line of individual nitrogen vacancies to the modes of microring resonators fabricated in single-crystal diamond. Zero-phonon line enhancement by more than a factor of 10 is estimated from lifetime measurements. The devices are fabricated using standard semiconductor techniques and off-the-shelf materials, thus enabling integrated diamond photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hewlett Packard Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, 94304, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Andrei Faraon"", "",\u00a0Paul E.

article,Coherent sampling of active mode-locked terahertz quantum cascade lasers and frequency synthesis,"<p>Terahertz quantum cascade lasers are compact, electrically pumped semiconductor laser sources that are capable of delivering tens of milliwatts of power in continuous wave. Here, we demonstrate that these devices can be operated in a regime of active mode-locking by modulating their bias current with a radiofrequency synthesizer. Detection of the emitted pulse train is made possible by phase-locking the quantum cascade laser repetition rate and carrier frequency to a harmonic of the repetition rate of a mode-locked femtosecond fibre laser. This technique allows coherent sampling of the terahertz electric field, showing that the terahertz pulses are transform-limited. In addition, our technique allows control of the carrier-envelope phase shift of the quantum cascade laser.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Mat\u00e9riaux et Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes Quantiques, Universit\u00e9 Paris 7 and CNRS UMR 7162, 10 rue A.
