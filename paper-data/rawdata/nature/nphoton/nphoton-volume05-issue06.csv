review article,Tweezers with a twist,"<p>The fact that light carries both linear and angular momentum is well-known to physicists. One application of the linear momentum of light is for optical tweezers, in which the refraction of a laser beam through a particle provides a reaction force that draws the particle towards the centre of the beam. The angular momentum of light can also be transfered to particles, causing them to spin. In fact, the angular momentum of light has two components that act through different mechanisms on various types of particle.

review article,Plasmon nano-optical tweezers,"<p>Conventional optical tweezers, formed at the diffraction-limited focus of a laser beam, have become a powerful and flexible tool for manipulating micrometre-sized objects. Extending optical trapping down to the nanometre scale would open unprecedented opportunities in many fields of science, where such nano-optical tweezers would allow the ultra-accurate positioning of single nano-objects. Among the possible strategies, the ability of metallic nanostructures to control light at the subwavelength scale can be exploited to engineer such nano-optical traps.

letter,Controlling birefringence in dielectrics,"<p>Birefringence, from the very essence of the word itself, refers to the splitting of light rays into two parts. In natural birefringent materials, this splitting is a beautiful phenomenon, resulting in the perception of a double image. In optical metamaterials, birefringence is often an unwanted side effect of forcing a device designed through transformation optics to operate in dielectrics. One polarization is usually implemented in dielectrics, and the other is sacrificed. Here we show, with techniques beyond transformation optics, that this need not be the case, that both polarizations can be controlled to perform useful tasks in dielectrics, and that rays, at all incident angles, can even follow different trajectories through a device and emerge together as if the birefringence did not exist at all. A number of examples are shown, including a combination Maxwell fisheye/Luneburg lens that performs a useful task and is achievable with current fabrication materials.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117576"", ""authors"": [""Aaron J.

letter,Active spatial control of plasmonic fields,"<p>The field of plasmonics offers a route to control light fields with metallic nanostructures through the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons. These surface waves, bound to a metal dielectric interface, can tightly confine electromagnetic energy. Active control over surface plasmon polaritons has potential for applications in sensing, photovoltaics, quantum communication, nanocircuitry, metamaterials and super-resolution microscopy. We achieve here active control of plasmonic fields using a digital spatial light modulator. Optimizing the plasmonic phases through feedback, we focus surface plasmon polaritons at a freely prechosen point on the surface of a nanohole array. Digital addressing and scanning of surface plasmon polaritons without mechanical motion may enable novel interdisciplinary applications of advanced plasmonic devices in cell microscopy, optical data storage and sensing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""FOM-Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics AMOLF, Science Park 104, Amsterdam, 1098 XG, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Bergin Gjonaj"", "",\u00a0Jochen Aulbach"", "",\u00a0Patrick M.

article,26 Tbit s−1 line-rate super-channel transmission utilizing all-optical fast Fourier transform processing,"<p>Optical transmission systems with terabit per second (Tbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) single-channel line rates no longer seem to be too far-fetched. New services such as cloud computing, three-dimensional high-definition television and virtual-reality applications require unprecedented optical channel bandwidths. These high-capacity optical channels, however, are fed from lower-bitrate signals. The question then is whether the lower-bitrate tributary information can viably, energy-efficiently and effortlessly be encoded to and extracted from terabit per second data streams. We demonstrate an optical fast Fourier transform scheme that provides the necessary computing power to encode lower-bitrate tributaries into 10.8 and 26.0&#160;Tbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> line-rate orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) data streams and to decode them from fibre-transmitted OFDM data streams. Experiments show the feasibility and ease of handling terabit per second data with low energy consumption.

article,Focusing and compression of ultrashort pulses through scattering media,"<p>Light scattering in inhomogeneous media induces wavefront distortions that pose an inherent limitation in many optical applications. Examples where this occurs include microscopy, nanosurgery and astronomy. In recent years, ongoing efforts have made the correction of spatial distortions possible using wavefront-shaping techniques. However, when ultrashort pulses are used, scattering also induces temporal distortions, which hinder the use of such pulses in nonlinear processes such as multiphoton microscopy and quantum control experiments. Here, we show that correction of both spatial and temporal distortions can be achieved by manipulating only the spatial degrees of freedom of the incident wavefront. By optimizing a nonlinear signal, we demonstrate spatiotemporal focusing and compression of chirped ultrashort pulses through scattering media, and refocusing in both space and time of 100&#160;fs pulses through thick brain and bone samples.
