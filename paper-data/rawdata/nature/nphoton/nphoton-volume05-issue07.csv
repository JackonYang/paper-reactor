letter,Single-cell biological lasers,"<p>Since their invention some 50 years ago, lasers have made a tremendous impact on modern science and technology. Nevertheless, lasing has so far relied on artificial or engineered optical gain materials, such as doped crystals, semiconductors, synthetic dyes and purified gases. Here, we show that fluorescent proteins in cells are a viable gain medium for optical amplification, and report the first successful realization of biological cell lasers based on green fluorescent protein (GFP). We demonstrate in vitro protein lasers using recombinant GFP solutions and introduce a laser based on single live cells expressing GFP. On optical pumping with nanojoule/nanosecond pulses, individual cells in a high-Q microcavity produce bright, directional and narrowband laser emission, with characteristic longitudinal and transverse modes. Lasing cells remained alive even after prolonged lasing action. Light amplification and lasing from and within biological systems pave the way to new forms of intracellular sensing, cytometry and imaging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, 02114, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Malte C.

letter,Broadband graphene polarizer,"<p>Conventional polarizers can be classified into three main modes of operation: sheet polarizer using anisotropic absorption media, prism polarizer by refraction and Brewster-angle polarizer by reflection. These polarizing components are not easily integrated with photonic circuits. The in-line fibre polarizer, which relies on polarization-selective coupling between the evanescent field and birefringent crystal or metal, is a promising alternative because of its compatibility with most fibre-optic systems. Here, we demonstrate the operation of a broadband fibre polarizer based on graphene, an ultrathin two-dimensional carbon material. The out-coupled light in the telecommunication band shows a strong s-polarization effect with an extinction ratio of 27&#160;dB. Unlike polarizers made from thin metal film, a graphene polarizer can support transverse-electric-mode surface wave propagation due to its linear dispersion of Dirac electrons.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 3, Singapore, 117543"", ""authors"": [""Qiaoliang Bao"", "",\u00a0Candy Haley Yi Xuan Lim"", "",\u00a0Yu Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kian Ping Loh""]}, {""address"": ""School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798"", ""authors"": [""Han Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ding Yuan Tang""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), 3 Research Link, Singapore, 117602"", ""authors"": [""Bing Wang""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China"", ""authors"": [""Zhenhua Ni""]}, {""address"": ""Service OPERA-photonique, Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles (U.L.B.), 50 Avenue F.

letter,Long-wavelength InAs/GaAs quantum-dot laser diode monolithically grown on Ge substrate,"<p>The realization of semiconductor laser diodes on Si substrates would permit the creation of complex optoelectronic circuits, enabling chip-to-chip and system-to-system optical communications. Direct epitaxial growth of III&#8211;V semiconductor materials on Si or Ge is one of the most promising candidates for the fabrication of electrically pumped light sources on a Si platform. Here, we describe the first quantum-dot laser to be realized on a Ge substrate. To fabricate the laser, a single-domain GaAs buffer layer was first grown on the Ge substrate using the Ga prelayer technique. A long-wavelength InAs/GaAs quantum-dot structure was then fabricated on the high-quality GaAs buffer layer. Lasing at a wavelength of 1,305&#160;nm with a low threshold current density of 55.2&#160;A&#160;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup> was observed under continuous-wave current drive at room temperature.

letter,Lensless imaging using broadband X-ray sources,"<p>High-resolution X-ray imaging techniques using optical elements such as zone plates are widely used for viewing the internal structure of samples in exquisite detail. The resolution attainable is ultimately limited by the manufacturing tolerances for the optics. Combining ideas from crystallography and holography, this limit may be surpassed by the method of coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). Although CDI shows particular promise in applications involving X-ray free-electron lasers, it is also emerging as an important new technique for imaging at third-generation synchrotrons. The limited coherent output of these sources, however, is a significant barrier to obtaining shorter exposure times. A fundamental assumption of coherent diffractive imaging is that the incident light is well-approximated by a single optical frequency. In this Letter, we demonstrate the first experimental realization of &#8216;polyCDI&#8217;, using a broadband source to achieve a factor of 60 reduction in the exposure time over quasi-monochromatic coherent diffractive imaging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-ray Science, School of Physics, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Brian Abbey"", "",\u00a0Lachlan W.

letter,Generation of ultrastable microwaves via optical frequency division,"<p>There has been increased interest in the use and manipulation of optical fields to address the challenging problems that have traditionally been approached with microwave electronics. Some examples that benefit from the low transmission loss, agile modulation and large bandwidths accessible with coherent optical systems include signal distribution, arbitrary waveform generation and novel imaging. We extend these advantages to demonstrate a microwave generator based on a high-quality-factor (Q) optical resonator and a frequency comb functioning as an optical-to-microwave divider. This provides a 10&#160;GHz electrical signal with fractional frequency instability of &#8804;8&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup> at 1&#160;s, a value comparable to that produced by the best microwave oscillators, but without the need for cryogenic temperatures.

article,Towards ultrasensitive optical links enabled by low-noise phase-sensitive amplifiers,"<p>In principle, optical phase-sensitive amplifiers are known to be capable of realizing noiseless amplification, as well as improving the signal-to-noise-ratio of optical links by 3&#160;dB compared to conventional, phase-insensitively amplified links. However, current state-of-the-art phase-sensitive amplifiers are still far from being practical, lacking, for example, significant noise performance improvement, broadband gain and modulation-format transparency. Here, we demonstrate experimentally, for the first time, an optical-fibre-based non-degenerate phase-sensitive amplifier link consisting of a phase-insensitive parametric copier followed by a phase-sensitive amplifier that provides broadband amplification, signal modulation-format independence, and nearly 6&#160;dB link noise-figure improvement over conventional, erbium-doped fibre amplifier-based links. The PSA has a record-low 1.1&#160;dB noise figure, and can be extended to work with multiple wavelength channels with modest system complexity. This concept can also be realized in other materials with third-order nonlinearities, and is useful in any attenuation-limited optical link.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Photonics Laboratory, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, SE-412 96, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Z.
