letter,High-energy pulse synthesis with sub-cycle waveform control for strong-field physics,"<p>Over the last decade, control of atomic-scale electronic motion by non-perturbative optical fields has broken tremendous new ground with the advent of phase-controlled high-energy few-cycle pulse sources. The development of close to single-cycle, carrier-envelope phase controlled, high-energy optical pulses has already led to isolated attosecond EUV pulse generation, expanding ultrafast spectroscopy to attosecond resolution. However, further investigation and control of these physical processes requires sub-cycle waveform shaping, which has not been achievable to date. Here, we present a light source, using coherent wavelength multiplexing, that enables sub-cycle waveform shaping with a two-octave-spanning spectrum and a pulse energy of 15&#160;&#181;J. It offers full phase control and allows generation of any optical waveform supported by the amplified spectrum. Both energy and bandwidth scale linearly with the number of sub-modules, so the peak power scales quadratically. The demonstrated system is the prototype of a class of novel optical tools for attosecond control of strong-field physics experiments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Shu-Wei Huang"", "",\u00a0Giovanni Cirmi"", "",\u00a0Jeffrey Moses"", "",\u00a0Kyung-Han Hong"", "",\u00a0Siddharth Bhardwaj"", "",\u00a0Jonathan R.

letter,Tandem colloidal quantum dot solar cells employing a graded recombination layer,"<p>Tuning of the electronic bandgap in colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) by changing their size enables the spectral response of CQD-based photodetectors and photovoltaic devices to be tailored. Multi-junction solar cells made from a combination of CQDs of differing sizes and thus bandgaps are a promising means by which to increase the energy harvested from the Sun's broad spectrum. Here, we report the first CQD tandem solar cells using the size-effect tuning of a single CQD material, PbS. We use a graded recombination layer to provide a progression of work functions from the hole-accepting electrode in the bottom cell to the electron-accepting electrode in the top cell, allowing matched electron and hole currents to meet and recombine. Our tandem solar cell has an open-circuit voltage of 1.06&#160;V, equal to the sum of the two constituent single-junction devices, and a solar power conversion efficiency of up to 4.2%.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, 10 King's College Road, Toronto, M5S 3G4, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Xihua Wang"", "",\u00a0Ghada I.

letter,Bi-directional ultrafast electric-field gating of interlayer charge transport in a cuprate superconductor,"<p>In cuprate superconductors, tunnelling between planes makes three-dimensional superconductive transport possible. However, the interlayer tunnelling amplitude is reduced when an order-parameter-phase gradient between planes is established. As such, interlayer superconductivity along the c-axis can be weakened if a strong electric field is applied along the c-axis. In this Letter, we use high-field single-cycle terahertz pulses to gate interlayer coupling in La<sub>1.84</sub>Sr<sub>0.16</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. We induce ultrafast oscillations between superconducting and resistive states and switch the plasmon response on and off, without reducing the density of Cooper pairs. In-plane superconductivity remains unperturbed, revealing a non-equilibrium state in which the dimensionality of the superconductivity is time-dependent. The gating frequency is determined by the electric field strength. Non-dissipative, bi-directional gating of superconductivity is of interest for device applications in ultrafast nanoelectronics and represents an example of how nonlinear terahertz physics can benefit nanoplasmonics and active metamaterials.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, UK"", ""authors"": [""A.

letter,Mid-infrared HgTe colloidal quantum dot photodetectors,"<p>Today's infrared imaging devices are based on bulk and quantum-confined epitaxial materials and would benefit greatly from higher operating temperatures and lower cost. Imaging chips based on colloidal quantum dot technology could offer a convenient lower-cost alternative, but, to date, the spectral range of operation of colloidal quantum dots has been limited. In this Letter, we report colloidal HgTe quantum dot photodetectors with a room-temperature photoresponse beyond 5&#160;&#181;m, the longest interband absorption wavelength reported so far for colloidal materials. The photodetectors are fabricated from colloidal solutions, which are then drop-cast as thin films on electrodes.

article,Plasmonically tailored micropotentials for ultracold atoms,"<p>Plasmonic near-fields can be structured with sub-optical wavelength resolution. This offers promising scenarios for trapping, guiding and manipulating cold atoms in plasmonically tailored dipole potentials, which could enable strong coupling between a single atom and a single plasmonic excitation. Here, we report on the interaction of Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates with the optical near-field above plasmonic micro- and submicrometre structures. At these structures, surface plasmon polaritons are excited by a laser in the Kretschmann configuration, giving rise to resonantly enhanced surface plasmons. We introduce a technique to measure the strength of optical near-fields by observing the reflection of cold atoms from the surface. In particular, the dependence of electromagnetic field enhancement on structure size is investigated. Furthermore, we show that the near-field induced potential landscape can be tailored to sub-micrometre dimensions by demonstrating matter&#8211;wave diffraction from a grating of plasmonic wires.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physikalisches Institut, Eberhard Karls Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 14, T\u00fcbingen, D-72076, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Christian Stehle"", "",\u00a0Helmar Bender"", "",\u00a0Claus Zimmermann"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sebastian Slama""]}, {""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Physik, Eberhard Karls Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 10, T\u00fcbingen, D-72076, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Dieter Kern"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Monika Fleischer""]}]",False,"[""Christian Stehle"", ""Helmar Bender"", ""Claus Zimmermann"", ""Dieter Kern"", ""Monika Fleischer"", ""Sebastian Slama""]","Stehle, C., Bender, H., Zimmermann, C. et al.

article,Zero phase delay in negative-refractive-index photonic crystal superlattices,"<p>We show that optical beams propagating in path-averaged zero-index photonic crystal superlattices can have zero phase delay. The nanofabricated superlattices consist of alternating stacks of negative index photonic crystals and positive index homogeneous dielectric media, where the phase differences corresponding to consecutive primary unit cells are measured with integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These measurements demonstrate that at path-averaged zero-index frequencies the phase accumulation remains constant and equal to zero despite the increase in the physical path length. We further demonstrate experimentally that these superlattice zero- bandgaps remain invariant to geometrical changes of the photonic structure and have a center frequency which is deterministically tunable. The properties of the zero- gap frequencies, optical phase, and effective refractive indices are well described by detailed experimental measurements, rigorous theoretical analysis, and comprehensive numerical simulations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optical Nanostructures Laboratory, Center for Integrated Science and Engineering, Solid-State Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, 10027, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""S.
