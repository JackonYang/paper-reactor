review article,Past achievements and future challenges in the development of three-dimensional photonic metamaterials,"<p>Photonic metamaterials are man-made structures composed of tailored micro- or nanostructured metallodielectric subwavelength building blocks. This deceptively simple yet powerful concept allows the realization of many new and unusual optical properties, such as magnetism at optical frequencies, negative refractive index, large positive refractive index, zero reflection through impedance matching, perfect absorption, giant circular dichroism and enhanced nonlinear optical properties. Possible applications of metamaterials include ultrahigh-resolution imaging systems, compact polarization optics and cloaking devices.

letter,Optical pulling force,"<p>A photon carries k of momentum, so it may be anticipated that light will &#8216;push&#8217; on any object standing in its path by means of the scattering force. In the absence of an intensity gradient, using a light beam to pull a particle backwards is counter-intuitive. Here, we show that it is possible to realize a backward scattering force that pulls a particle all the way towards the source without an equilibrium point. The underlining physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. We show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle, and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small, an attractive optical force is possible. This possibility adds &#8216;pulling&#8217; as an additional degree of freedom to optical micromanipulation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics and Department of Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China"", ""authors"": [""Jun Chen""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"", ""authors"": [""Jack Ng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0C.

letter,Nanomoulding of transparent zinc oxide electrodes for efficient light trapping in solar cells,"<p>Nanopatterning has gained tremendous importance in the field of photovoltaics, as absorption of sunlight in solar cells can be enhanced drastically by proper engineering of photonic nanostructures. However, despite intensive efforts, neither the ideal surface morphology nor the ideal scattering characteristics for optimum light trapping have been identified. Experimentally, a method capable of implementing arbitrarily designed surface morphologies directly into functional devices is desirable. Here, we establish a nanomoulding process that provides exactly such a platform, enabling precise, large-area, nanoscale patterning of functional zinc oxide films at low cost. We illustrate the application of nanomoulded zinc oxide films as transparent front electrodes in amorphous silicon solar cells, demonstrating excellent initial conversion efficiencies of 10.1%. In the quest to find the most efficient light-harvesting scheme, we anticipate that nanomoulding will catalyse the development and integration of exciting new nanophotonic structures.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Institute of Microengineering (IMT), Photovoltaics and Thin Film Electronics Laboratory, 2000 Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Corsin Battaglia"", "",\u00a0Jordi Escarr\u00e9"", "",\u00a0Karin S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m"", "",\u00a0Mathieu Charri\u00e8re"", "",\u00a0Matthieu Despeisse"", "",\u00a0Franz-Josef Haug"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christophe Ballif""]}]",False,"[""Corsin Battaglia"", ""Jordi Escarr\u00e9"", ""Karin S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m"", ""Mathieu Charri\u00e8re"", ""Matthieu Despeisse"", ""Franz-Josef Haug"", ""Christophe Ballif""]","Battaglia, C., Escarré, J., Söderström, K. et al.

letter,Near-100% Bragg reflectivity of X-rays,"<p>Ultrahigh-reflectance mirrors are essential optical elements of the most sophisticated optical instruments devised over the entire frequency spectrum. In the X-ray regime, super-polished mirrors with close to 100% reflectivity are routinely used at grazing angles of incidence. However, at large angles of incidence, and particularly at normal incidence, such high reflectivity has not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate by direct measurements that synthetic, nearly defect-free diamond crystals reflect more than 99% of hard X-ray photons backwards in Bragg diffraction, with a remarkably small variation in magnitude across the sample. This is a quantum leap in the largest reflectivity measured to date, which is at the limit of what is theoretically possible.

This device has remarkable advantages over its passive counterparts, including a large dynamic range of isolation, fast switching capability and reversibility, which provide new functionality that is useful in various types of all-optical systems.

article,Giant broadband nonlinear optical absorption response in dispersed graphene single sheets,"<p>Under intense laser excitation, thin films and suspensions of graphite and its nanostructure, including carbon black, nanotubes, few-layer graphenes and graphene oxides, exhibit induced transparency due to saturable absorption. This switches to optical limiting only at very high fluences when induced breakdown gives rise to microbubbles and microplasmas that causes nonlinear scattering. Here, we show that dispersed graphenes, in contrast, can exhibit broadband nonlinear optical absorption at fluences well below this damage threshold with a strong matrix effect. We obtained, for nanosecond visible and near-infrared pulses, a new benchmark for optical energy-limiting onset of 10&#160;mJ&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> for a linear transmittance of 70%, with excellent output clamping in both heavy-atom solvents and polymer film matrices. Nanosecond pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy in chlorobenzene reveals that the nanographene domains switch from the usual broadband photo-induced bleaching to a novel reverse saturable absorption mechanism with increasing excitation densities across this threshold.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""DSO National Laboratories, 20 Science Park Drive, Science Park I, Singapore, 118230, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Geok-Kieng Lim"", "",\u00a0Wee-Hao Ng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hong-Wee Tan""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, S117542, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Geok-Kieng Lim"", "",\u00a0Zhi-Li Chen"", "",\u00a0Richard H.

article,Sensitive mid-infrared detection in wide-bandgap semiconductors using extreme non-degenerate two-photon absorption,"<p>Identifying strong and fast nonlinearities for today's photonic applications is an ongoing effort. Materials and devices are typically sought to achieve increasing nonlinear interactions. We report large enhancement of two-photon absorption through intrinsic resonances using extremely non-degenerate photon pairs. We experimentally demonstrate two-photon absorption enhancements by factors of 100&#8211;1,000 over degenerate two-photon absorption in direct-bandgap semiconductors. This enables gated detection of sub-bandgap and sub-100&#160;pJ mid-infrared radiation using large-bandgap detectors at room temperature. Detection characteristics are comparable in performance to liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe (MCT) detectors. The temporal resolution of this gated detection by two-photon absorption is determined by the gating pulse duration.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CREOL, the College of Optics & Photonics, University of Central Florida, 4000 Central Florida Blvd, Orlando, 32816-2700, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""Dmitry A.
