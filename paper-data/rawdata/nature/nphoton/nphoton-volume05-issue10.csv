review article,The photonic integration of non-solid media using optofluidics,"<p>Photonics has long been used to study non-solid materials such as liquids, gases and plasmas, but these fluidic media have traditionally not comprised a functional part of the photonic device or system. The emerging field of optofluidics seeks to create new ways of uniting solid and non-solid materials in a single photonic system whose optical properties are typically defined by the fluidic component. This Review summarizes the current state of optofluidics from a photonics perspective. First, we describe a new class of photonic elements based on the combination of fluidic media and integrated optical structures. We then discuss the applications of optofluidic principles to particle sensing and manipulation in fluids, and finally assess current challenges and potential directions for future developments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Engineering, University of California at Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, 95064, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Holger Schmidt""]}, {""address"": ""Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, 459 Clyde Building, Brigham Young University, Provo, 84602, Utah, USA"", ""authors"": [""Aaron R.

letter,Dynamic modulation of photonic crystal nanocavities using gigahertz acoustic phonons,"<p>Photonic crystal membranes provide a versatile planar platform for on-chip implementations of photonic quantum circuits. One prominent quantum element is a coupled system consisting of a nanocavity and a single quantum dot, which forms a fundamental building block for elaborate quantum information networks and a cavity quantum electrodynamic system controlled by single photons. To date, no fast tuning mechanism is available to achieve control within the system coherence time. Here, we demonstrate dynamic tuning by monochromatic coherent acoustic phonons formed by a surface acoustic wave with frequencies exceeding 1.7&#160;GHz, one order of magnitude faster than alternative approaches. We resolve a periodic modulation of the optical mode exceeding eight times its linewidth, preserving both the spatial mode profile and a high quality factor. Because photonic crystal membranes confine photonic and phononic excitations, coupling optical to acoustic frequencies, our technique opens up the way to coherent acoustic control of optomechanical crystals.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik 1 and Augsburg Centre for Innovative Technologies (ACIT), Universit\u00e4t Augsburg, Universit\u00e4tsstr. 1, Augsburg, 86159, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Daniel A.

letter,All-optical control of the quantum flow of a polariton condensate,"<p>Although photons in vacuum are massless particles that do not appreciably interact with each other, significant interactions appear in suitable nonlinear media, leading to hydrodynamic behaviours typical of quantum fluids. Here, we show the generation and manipulation of vortex&#8211;antivortex pairs in a coherent gas of strongly dressed photons (polaritons) flowing against an artificial potential barrier created and controlled by a light beam in a semiconductor microcavity. The optical control of the polariton flow allows us to reveal new quantum hydrodynamical phenomenologies such as the formation of vortex pairs upstream from the optical barrier, a case of ultrashort time excitation of the quantum flow, and the generation of vortices with counterflow trajectories. Additionally, we demonstrate how to permanently trap and store quantum vortices hydrodynamically generated in the wake of a defect.

letter,The mode-locking transition of random lasers,"<p>The discovery of the spontaneous mode-locking of lasers, that is, the self-starting synchronous oscillation of electromagnetic modes in a cavity, has been a milestone of photonics allowing the realization of oscillators delivering ultrashort pulses. This process is so far known to occur only in standard ordered lasers and only in the presence of a specific device (the saturable absorber). We engineer a mode-selective pumping of a random laser formed by a self-assembled cluster of nanometric particles. We show that the random laser can be continuously driven from a configuration exhibiting weakly interacting electromagnetic resonances to a regime of collectively oscillating strongly interacting modes. This phenomenon, which opens the way to the development of a new generation of miniaturized and all-optically controlled light sources, may be explained as the first evidence of spontaneous mode-locking in disordered resonators.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid (CSIC) and Unidad Asociada CSIC-UVigo, Calle Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz 3, Madrid, 28049, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Marco Leonetti"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Cefe Lopez""]}, {""address"": ""Dep.

letter,Sub-picosecond phase-sensitive optical pulse characterization on a chip,"<p>The recent introduction of coherent optical communications has created a compelling need for ultrafast phase-sensitive measurement techniques operating at milliwatt peak power levels and in timescales ranging from sub-picoseconds to nanoseconds. Previous reports of ultrafast optical signal measurements in integrated platforms include time-lens temporal imaging on a silicon chip and waveguide-based frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG). Time-lens imaging is phase-insensitive, and waveguide-based FROG methods require the integration of long tunable delay lines, which is still an unsolved challenge. Here, we report a device capable of characterizing both the amplitude and phase of ultrafast optical pulses with the aid of a synchronized incoherently related clock pulse. It is based on a novel variation of spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) that exploits degenerate four-wave mixing in a CMOS-compatible chip. We measure pulses with a peak power of &lt;100&#160;mW, a frequency bandwidth of &gt;1&#160;THz, and up to 100&#160;ps pulsewidths, yielding a time&#8211;bandwidth product of &gt;100.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ultrafast Optical Processing, Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique \u2013 Energie, Mat\u00e9riaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (INRS-EMT), Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, 1650 Boulevard L.

letter,Quantum communication with Gaussian channels of zero quantum capacity,"<p>As with classical information, error-correcting codes enable reliable transmission of quantum information through noisy or lossy channels. In contrast to classical theory, imperfect quantum channels exhibit a strong kind of synergy: pairs of discrete memoryless quantum channels exist, each of zero quantum capacity, which acquire positive quantum capacity when used together. Here, we show that this &#8216;superactivation&#8217; phenomenon also occurs in the more realistic setting of optical channels with attenuation and Gaussian noise. This paves the way for its experimental realization and application in real-world communications systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IBM TJ Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, 10598, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Graeme Smith"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0John A.

letter,Preparation and storage of frequency-uncorrelated entangled photons from cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric downconversion,"<p>The preparation and storage of photonic entanglement are central to the achievement of scalable linear optical quantum computation (LOQC). The most widely used photonic entanglement source (a spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) source) is not directly suitable for storage, because its working frequency bandwidth is significantly larger than any available quantum memory. To remedy this problem, cavity-enhanced narrow-band SPDC sources have been developed. However, the storage of cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photons has not yet been achieved. Also, the spectral correlations between the entangled photons can make them practically useless for scalable LOQC. Here, we report the preparation and storage of frequency-uncorrelated narrowband (5&#160;MHz) entangled photons from a cavity-enhanced SPDC source. The frequency correlation between the entangled photons is eliminated by changing the continuous UV pumping beam to short pulses. The storage of the polarization state of a single photon, and of a photon entangled with another flying in the fibre, is demonstrated. Our work demonstrates a quantum interface between narrow-band entangled photons from cavity SPDC and atomic quantum memory, and thus provides an important tool towards the achievement of all-optical quantum information processing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, PR China"", ""authors"": [""Han Zhang"", "",\u00a0Xian-Min Jin"", "",\u00a0Jian Yang"", "",\u00a0Han-Ning Dai"", "",\u00a0Sheng-Jun Yang"", "",\u00a0Tian-Ming Zhao"", "",\u00a0Jun Rui"", "",\u00a0Yu He"", "",\u00a0Xiao Jiang"", "",\u00a0Ge-Sheng Pan"", "",\u00a0Zhen-Sheng Yuan"", "",\u00a0Youjin Deng"", "",\u00a0Zeng-Bing Chen"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Hui Bao"", "",\u00a0Shuai Chen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""Physikalisches Institut, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Philosophenweg 12, D-69120, Heidelberg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Fan Yang""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, A-6020, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Bo Zhao""]}]",False,"[""Han Zhang"", ""Xian-Min Jin"", ""Jian Yang"", ""Han-Ning Dai"", ""Sheng-Jun Yang"", ""Tian-Ming Zhao"", ""Jun Rui"", ""Yu He"", ""Xiao Jiang"", ""Fan Yang"", ""Ge-Sheng Pan"", ""Zhen-Sheng Yuan"", ""Youjin Deng"", ""Zeng-Bing Chen"", ""Xiao-Hui Bao"", ""Shuai Chen"", ""Bo Zhao"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Zhang, H., Jin, X., Yang, J. et al.

letter,Cavity electromagnetically induced transparency and all-optical switching using ion Coulomb crystals,"<p>The control of one light field by another, ultimately at the single photon level, is a challenging task that has numerous interesting applications within nonlinear optics and quantum information science. This type of control can only be achieved through highly nonlinear interactions, such as those based on electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT). Here, we demonstrate for the first time EIT as well as all-optical EIT-based light switching using ion Coulomb crystals situated in an optical cavity. Changes from essentially full transmission to full absorption of a single photon probe field are achieved within unprecedentedly narrow EIT windows of a few tens of kilohertz. By applying a weak switching field, this allows us to demonstrate nearly perfect switching of the transmission of the probe field. The results represent important milestones for future realizations of quantum information processing devices, such as high-efficiency quantum memories, single-photon transistors and single-photon gates.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, QUANTOP \u2013 Danish National Research Foundation Center for Quantum Optics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, DK-8000, Denmark"", ""authors"": [""Magnus Albert"", "",\u00a0Aur\u00e9lien Dantan"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Michael Drewsen""]}]",False,"[""Magnus Albert"", ""Aur\u00e9lien Dantan"", ""Michael Drewsen""]","Albert, M., Dantan, A. & Drewsen, M.
