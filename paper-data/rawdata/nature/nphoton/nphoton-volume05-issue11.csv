review article,High-energy attosecond light sources,"<p>The development of attosecond technology is one of the most significant achievements in the field of ultrafast optics over the past decade. Since the first experimental demonstration of attosecond pulses just ten years ago, novel techniques have been introduced for the generation, characterization and application of subfemtosecond pulses. The development of attosecond tools is continuously triggering the introduction of new spectroscopic and measurement methods, which will offer the opportunity to investigate unexplored research areas with unprecedented time resolution. The wealth of ultrafast processes, which can be investigated by taking advantage of attosecond temporal resolution, can be greatly extended by the development of high-intensity attosecond sources. This Review covers a selection of recent advances in the field of attosecond technology, with particular attention being given to the generation and application of high-energy attosecond pulses.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Politecnico di Milano, National Research Council of Italy, Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnologies, Piazza L. da Vinci 32, Milano, 20133, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Giuseppe Sansone"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mauro Nisoli""]}, {""address"": ""National Research Council of Italy, Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnologies, Via Trasea 7, Padova, 35131, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Luca Poletto""]}]",False,"[""Giuseppe Sansone"", ""Luca Poletto"", ""Mauro Nisoli""]","Sansone, G., Poletto, L. & Nisoli, M.

review article,Femtosecond to attosecond light pulses from a molecular modulator,"<p>Ultrafast science has begun to tackle the measurement of electronic and chemical processes taking place on the few-femtosecond-to-attosecond timescale. This field requires high-power, extremely short-duration laser pulses. Here we review progress towards the generation of such pulses by Raman scattering in a medium whose component molecules oscillate in phase, which modulates the optical polarizability of the medium and generates high-order Raman sidebands on a field propagating through it. This process may occur with high efficiency and thus lead to sufficient bandwidth for supporting few-femtosecond to attosecond pulses. Significant progress has recently been made in the use of this technique to deliver useable ultrashort pulses in the visible to ultraviolet regions of the spectrum.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College, London, SW7 2AZ, UK"", ""authors"": [""S.

letter,Efficient photovoltage multiplication in carbon nanotubes,"<p>Carbon nanotubes are direct-bandgap materials that are not only useful for nanoelectronic applications, but also have the potential to make a significant impact on the next generation of photovoltaic technology. A semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) has an unusual band structure, as a result of which high-efficiency carrier multiplication effects have been predicted and observed and films of SWCNTs with absorption close to 100% have been reported. Other features that are also important for photovoltaic applications include high mobility and the availability of ohmic contacts for both electrons and holes. However, the photovoltage generated from a typical semiconducting SWCNT is less than 0.2 V, which is too small for most practical photovoltaic applications. Here, we show that this value may be readily multiplied by using virtual contacts at the carbon nanotube. In one example, more than 1.0 V is generated from a 10-&#956;m-long carbon nanotube with a single-cell photovoltage of &#8764;0.2 V.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Key Laboratory for the Physics and Chemistry of Nanodevices, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China"", ""authors"": [""Leijing Yang"", "",\u00a0Sheng Wang"", "",\u00a0Qingsheng Zeng"", "",\u00a0Zhiyong Zhang"", "",\u00a0Tian Pei"", "",\u00a0Yan Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Lian-Mao Peng""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China"", ""authors"": [""Leijing Yang"", "",\u00a0Sheng Wang"", "",\u00a0Qingsheng Zeng"", "",\u00a0Zhiyong Zhang"", "",\u00a0Tian Pei"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Lian-Mao Peng""]}, {""address"": ""Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China"", ""authors"": [""Leijing Yang""]}, {""address"": ""College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China"", ""authors"": [""Yan Li""]}]",False,"[""Leijing Yang"", ""Sheng Wang"", ""Qingsheng Zeng"", ""Zhiyong Zhang"", ""Tian Pei"", ""Yan Li"", ""Lian-Mao Peng""]","Yang, L., Wang, S., Zeng, Q. et al.

letter,Plasmonic generation of ultrashort extreme-ultraviolet light pulses,"<p>Ultrashort extreme-ultraviolet pulses are a key tool in time-resolved spectroscopy for the investigation of electronic motion in atoms, molecules and solids. High-harmonic generation is a well-established process for producing ultrashort extreme-ultraviolet pulses by direct frequency upconversion of femtosecond near-infrared pulses. However, elaborate pump&#8211;probe experiments performed on the attosecond timescale require continuous efforts to improve the spatiotemporal coherence and also the repetition rate of the generated pulses. Here, we demonstrate a three-dimensional metallic waveguide for the plasmonic generation of ultrashort extreme-ultraviolet pulses by means of field enhancement using surface-plasmon polaritons. The intensity enhancement factor reaches a peak of &#8764;350, allowing generation up to the 43rd harmonic in xenon gas, with a modest incident intensity of &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>11</sup>&#160;W&#160;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup>. The pulse repetition rate is maintained as high as 75&#160;MHz without external cavities. The plasmonic waveguide is fabricated on a cantilever microstructure and is therefore suitable for near-field spectroscopy with nanometre-scale lateral selectivity.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ultrafast Optics for Ultraprecision Group, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, 305-701, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""In-Yong Park"", "",\u00a0Seungchul Kim"", "",\u00a0Joonhee Choi"", "",\u00a0Dong-Hyub Lee"", "",\u00a0Young-Jin Kim"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Seung-Woo Kim""]}, {""address"": ""Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics, Hans-Kopfermann-Str. 1, Garching, D-85748, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Matthias F.

article,Breaking the diffusion limit with super-hydrophobic delivery of molecules to plasmonic nanofocusing SERS structures,"<p>The detection of a few molecules in a highly diluted solution is of paramount interest in fields including biomedicine, safety and eco-pollution in relation to rare and dangerous chemicals. Nanosensors based on plasmonics are promising devices in this regard, in that they combine the features of high sensitivity, label-free detection and miniaturization. However, plasmonic-based nanosensors, in common with general sensors with sensitive areas on the scale of nanometres, cannot be used directly to detect molecules dissolved in femto- or attomolar solutions. In other words, they are diffusion-limited and their detection times become impractical at such concentrations. In this Article, we demonstrate, by combining super-hydrophobic artificial surfaces and nanoplasmonic structures, that few molecules can be localized and detected even at attomolar (10<sup>&#8722;18</sup>&#160;mol&#160;l<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) concentration. Moreover, the detection can be combined with fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy, such that the chemical signature of the molecules can be clearly determined.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Nanostructrures, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), via Morego 30, Genova, I16163, Italy"", ""authors"": [""F.

article,Resonance-shifting to circumvent reabsorption loss in luminescent solar concentrators,"<p>Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) provide a simple means to concentrate sunlight without tracking the Sun. These devices absorb and then re-emit light at a lower frequency into the confined modes of a transparent slab, where it is guided towards photovoltaic cells attached to the slab edges. In the thermodynamic limit, a concentration ratio exceeding the equivalent of 100 suns is possible, but, in actual LSCs, optical propagation loss (due mostly to reabsorption) limits the concentration ratio to &#8764;10. Here, we introduce a general, all-optical means to overcome this problem by &#8216;resonance-shifting&#8217;, in which sharply directed emission from a bilayer cavity into the glass substrate returns to interact with the cavity off-resonance at each subsequent bounce, significantly reducing reabsorption loss en route to the edges. Using this strategy, we demonstrate near-lossless propagation for several different chromophores, which ultimately enables a more than twofold increase in concentration ratio over that of the corresponding conventional LSC.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Nanoscale Materials, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, 60439, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Noel C.

article,Optical control of one and two hole spins in interacting quantum dots,"<p>A single hole spin in a semiconductor quantum dot has emerged as a quantum bit that is potentially superior to an electron spin. A key feature of holes is that they have a greatly reduced hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins, which is one of the biggest difficulties in working with an electron spin. It is now essential to show that holes are viable for quantum information processing by demonstrating fast quantum gates and scalability. To this end, we have developed InAs/GaAs quantum dots coupled through coherent tunnelling and charged with controlled numbers of holes. We report fast, single-qubit gates using a sequence of short laser pulses. We then take the important next step towards scalability of quantum information by optically controlling two interacting hole spins in separate dots.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, District of Columbia, 20375, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alex Greilich"", "",\u00a0Samuel G.
