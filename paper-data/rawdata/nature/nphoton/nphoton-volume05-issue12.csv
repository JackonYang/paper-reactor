letter,Enhanced single-photon emission from a diamond–silver aperture,"<p>Solid-state quantum emitters, such as the nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, are robust systems for practical realizations of various quantum information processing protocols and nanoscale magnetometry schemes at room temperature. Such applications benefit from the high emission efficiency and flux of single photons, which can be achieved by engineering the electromagnetic environment of the emitter. One attractive approach is based on plasmonic resonators, in which sub-wavelength confinement of optical fields can strongly modify the spontaneous emission of a suitably embedded dipole despite having only modest quality factors. Meanwhile, the scalability of solid-state quantum systems critically depends on the ability to control such emitter&#8211;cavity interaction in a number of devices arranged in parallel. Here, we demonstrate a method to enhance the radiative emission rate of single nitrogen-vacancy centres in ordered arrays of plasmonic apertures that promises greater scalability over the previously demonstrated bottom-up approaches for the realization of on-chip quantum networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jennifer T.

letter,Molecular imaging true-colour spectroscopic optical coherence tomography,"<p>Molecular imaging holds a pivotal role in medicine due to its ability to provide invaluable insight into disease mechanisms at molecular and cellular levels. To this end, various techniques have been developed for molecular imaging, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, fluorescence imaging achieves micrometre-scale resolution, but has low penetration depths and is mostly limited to exogenous agents. Here, we demonstrate molecular imaging of endogenous and exogenous chromophores using a novel form of spectroscopic optical coherence tomography. Our approach consists of using a wide spectral bandwidth laser source centred in the visible spectrum, thereby allowing facile assessment of haemoglobin oxygen levels, providing contrast from readily available absorbers, and enabling true-colour representation of samples. This approach provides high spectral fidelity while imaging at the micrometre scale in three dimensions. Molecular imaging true-colour spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (METRiCS OCT) has significant implications for many biomedical applications including ophthalmology, early cancer detection, and understanding fundamental disease mechanisms such as hypoxia and angiogenesis.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Biomedical Engineering and Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, 27708, USA"", ""authors"": [""Francisco E.

letter,Multilevel quantization of optical phase in a novel coherent parametric mixer architecture,"<p>The exponentially increasing capacity demand in information systems will be met by carefully exploiting the complementary strengths of electronics and optics. Optical signal processing provides simple but powerful pipeline functions that offer high speed, low power, low latency and a route to densely parallel execution. A number of functions such as modulation and sampling, complex filtering and Fourier transformation have already been demonstrated. However, the key functionality of all-optical quantization has still not been addressed effectively. Here, we report an all-optical signal processing architecture that enables, for the first time, multilevel all-optical quantization of phase-encoded optical signals. A four-wave-mixing process is used to generate a comb of phase harmonics of the input signal, and a two-pump parametric process to coherently combine a selected harmonic with the input signal, realizing phase quantization. We experimentally demonstrate operation up to six levels.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK"", ""authors"": [""Joseph Kakande"", "",\u00a0Radan Slav\u00edk"", "",\u00a0Francesca Parmigiani"", "",\u00a0Periklis Petropoulos"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0David J.

letter,On-chip optical isolation in monolithically integrated non-reciprocal optical resonators,"<p>Non-reciprocal photonic devices, including optical isolators and circulators, are indispensible components in optical communication systems. However, the integration of such devices on semiconductor platforms has been challenging because of material incompatibilities between semiconductors and magneto-optical materials that necessitate wafer bonding, and because of the large footprint of isolator designs. Here, we report the first monolithically integrated magneto-optical isolator on silicon. Using a non-reciprocal optical resonator on an silicon-on-insulator substrate, we demonstrate unidirectional optical transmission with an isolation ratio up to 19.5&#160;dB near the 1,550&#160;nm telecommunication wavelength in a homogeneous external magnetic field. Our device has a small footprint that is 290&#160;&#181;m in length, significantly smaller than a conventional integrated optical isolator on a single crystal garnet substrate. This monolithically integrated non-reciprocal optical resonator may serve as a fundamental building block in a variety of ultracompact silicon photonic devices including optical isolators and circulators, enabling future low-cost, large-scale integration.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Lei Bi"", "",\u00a0Peng Jiang"", "",\u00a0Dong Hun Kim"", "",\u00a0Gerald F.

article,Nearly single-crystalline GaN light-emitting diodes on amorphous glass substrates,"<p>Single-crystalline GaN-based light-emitting diodes (s-LEDs) on crystalline sapphire wafers can provide point-like light sources with high conversion efficiency and long working lifetimes. Recently, s-LEDs on silicon wafers have been developed in efforts to overcome the size limitations of the sapphire substrate. However, to create larger, cheaper and efficient flat light sources, the fabrication of high-performance s-LEDs on amorphous glass substrates would be required, which remains a scientific challenge. Here, we report the fabrication of nearly single-crystalline GaN on amorphous glass substrates, in the form of pyramid arrays. This is achieved by high-temperature, predominant GaN growth on a site-confined nucleation layer with preferential polycrystalline morphology through local hetero-epitaxy. InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum wells formed on the GaN pyramid arrays exhibit a high internal quantum efficiency of 52%. LED arrays fabricated using these GaN pyramid arrays demonstrate reliable and stable area-type electroluminescent emission with a luminance of 600&#160;cd&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Frontier Research Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Kyunggi-do 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jun Hee Choi"", "",\u00a0Andrei Zoulkarneev"", "",\u00a0Sun Il Kim"", "",\u00a0Chan Wook Baik"", "",\u00a0Sung Soo Park"", "",\u00a0Hwansoo Suh"", "",\u00a0Un Jeong Kim"", "",\u00a0Hyung Bin Son"", "",\u00a0Jae Soong Lee"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jong Min Kim""]}, {""address"": ""Analytical Engineering Group, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Kyunggi-do 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Min Ho Yang""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-744, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jun Hee Choi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Miyoung Kim""]}, {""address"": ""Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Kyunggi-do 446-712, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Kinam Kim""]}]",False,"[""Jun Hee Choi"", ""Andrei Zoulkarneev"", ""Sun Il Kim"", ""Chan Wook Baik"", ""Min Ho Yang"", ""Sung Soo Park"", ""Hwansoo Suh"", ""Un Jeong Kim"", ""Hyung Bin Son"", ""Jae Soong Lee"", ""Miyoung Kim"", ""Jong Min Kim"", ""Kinam Kim""]","Choi, J., Zoulkarneev, A., Kim, S. et al.

article,Spectral line-by-line pulse shaping of on-chip microresonator frequency combs,"<p>Recently, on-chip comb generation methods based on nonlinear optical modulation in ultrahigh-quality-factor monolithic microresonators have been demonstrated, where two pump photons are transformed into sideband photons in a four-wave-mixing process mediated by Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we investigate line-by-line pulse shaping of such combs generated in silicon nitride ring resonators. We observe two distinct paths to comb formation that exhibit strikingly different time-domain behaviours. For combs formed as a cascade of sidebands spaced by a single free spectral range that spread from the pump, we are able to compress stably to nearly bandwidth-limited pulses. This indicates high coherence across the spectra and provides new data on the high passive stability of the spectral phase. For combs where the initial sidebands are spaced by multiple free spectral ranges that then fill in to give combs with single free-spectral-range spacing, the time-domain data reveal partially coherent behaviour.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, 465 Northwestern Avenue, West Lafayette, 47907-2035, Indiana, USA"", ""authors"": [""Fahmida Ferdous"", "",\u00a0Daniel E.
