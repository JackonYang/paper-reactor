review article,Surface plasmon–polariton amplifiers and lasers,"<p>Amplifiers and lasers based on surface plasmon&#8211;polaritons (SPPs) have been studied for around three decades. Research in this area has experienced particularly significant growth over the past decade, resulting in the achievement of several important milestones. Convincing demonstrations of SPP amplification and lasing have been reported for various systems involving single-interface, long-range, short-range and resonant SPPs. Diverse metallic structures such as planes, films, stripes, wires and particles (some on the nanoscale) have been integrated with gain materials. Although the prospects for SPP amplifiers and lasers are bright, the field is embryonic, and much remains to be explored and improved. This Review discusses this rapidly progressing area and summarizes the most important progress achieved so far. Research directions that warrant further investigation are also suggested.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, 161 Louis Pasteur St, Ottawa, K1N 6N5, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Pierre Berini"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Israel De Leon""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, 150 Louis Pasteur St, Ottawa, K1N 6N5, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Pierre Berini"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Israel De Leon""]}]",False,"[""Pierre Berini"", ""Israel De Leon""]","Berini, P., De Leon, I.

letter,Nanoscale spectroscopy with polarized X-rays by NEXAFS-TXM,"<p>Near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (NEXAFS) is an essential analytical tool in material science. Combining NEXAFS with scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) adds spatial resolution and the possibility to study individual nanostructures. Here, we describe a full-field transmission X-ray microscope (TXM) that generates high-resolution, large-area NEXAFS data with a collection rate two orders of magnitude faster than is possible with STXM. The TXM optical design combines a spectral resolution of E/&#916;E&#160;=&#160;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>4</sup> with a spatial resolution of 25 nm in a field of view of 15&#8211;20 &#181;m and a data acquisition time of &#8764;1 s. As an example, we present image stacks and polarization-dependent NEXAFS spectra from individual anisotropic sodium and protonated titanate nanoribbons. Our NEXAFS-TXM technique has the advantage that one image stack visualizes a large number of nanostructures and therefore already contains statistical information. This new high-resolution NEXAFS-TXM technique opens the way to advanced nanoscale science studies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Helmholtz-Zentrum f\u00fcr Materialien und Energie GmbH, Institute for Soft Matter and Functional Materials, Albert-Einstein-Str. 15, Berlin, 12489, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Peter Guttmann"", "",\u00a0Stefan Rehbein"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gerd Schneider""]}, {""address"": ""Electron Microscopy for Materials Science, University of Antwerp, Groenenborgerlaan 171, Antwerp, 2020, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Carla Bittencourt"", "",\u00a0Xiaoxing Ke"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gustaaf Van Tendeloo""]}, {""address"": ""Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Jamova 39, Ljubljana, 1000, Slovenia"", ""authors"": [""Polona Umek""]}, {""address"": ""CNRS UMR6502, Institut des Mat\u00e9riaux Jean Rouxel, Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, rue de la Houssiniere 2, Nantes, 44322, France"", ""authors"": [""Chris P.

letter,Laser mode feeding by shaking quantum dots in a planar microcavity,"<p>Semiconductor light emission can be changed considerably in an optical resonator. Prerequisite is that the electronic transitions involved in light generation are in resonance with a cavity mode. Although resonance can be arranged through dedicated fabrication, there are cases where this is virtually impossible. As an example, we study a planar microcavity containing an inhomogeneous quantum dot ensemble with a spectral broadening much larger than the optical mode width, so that resonance is achieved for a tiny dot fraction only. Still, the laser threshold can be crossed at moderate optical pumping. We demonstrate that strain pulses generated by ultrafast acoustics techniques can be used to modulate the transition energies so that resonance with the optical mode is dynamically induced for a much larger dot fraction. As a result, the emission output can be enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude, which is potentially useful for modulating light sources.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Experimentelle Physik 2, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, Dortmund, D-44221, Germany"", ""authors"": [""C.

letter,Self-terminating diffraction gates femtosecond X-ray nanocrystallography measurements,"<p>X-ray free-electron lasers have enabled new approaches to the structural determination of protein crystals that are too small or radiation-sensitive for conventional analysis. For sufficiently short pulses, diffraction is collected before significant changes occur to the sample, and it has been predicted that pulses as short as 10&#160;fs may be required to acquire atomic-resolution structural information. Here, we describe a mechanism unique to ultrafast, ultra-intense X-ray experiments that allows structural information to be collected from crystalline samples using high radiation doses without the requirement for the pulse to terminate before the onset of sample damage. Instead, the diffracted X-rays are gated by a rapid loss of crystalline periodicity, producing apparent pulse lengths significantly shorter than the duration of the incident pulse. The shortest apparent pulse lengths occur at the highest resolution, and our measurements indicate that current X-ray free-electron laser technology should enable structural determination from submicrometre protein crystals with atomic resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, DESY, Notkestrasse 85, Hamburg, 22607, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Anton Barty"", "",\u00a0Carl Caleman"", "",\u00a0Andrew Aquila"", "",\u00a0Thomas A.

letter,Macroscopic non-classical states and terahertz quantum processing in room-temperature diamond,"<p>The nature of the transition between the familiar classical, macroscopic world and the quantum, microscopic one continues to be poorly understood. Expanding the regime of observable quantum behaviour to large-scale objects is therefore an exciting open problem. In macroscopic systems of interacting particles, rapid thermalization usually destroys any quantum coherence before it can be measured or used at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate quantum processing in the vibrational modes of a macroscopic diamond sample under ambient conditions. Using ultrafast Raman scattering, we create an extended, highly non-classical state in the optical phonon modes of bulk diamond. Direct measurement of phonon coherence and correlations establishes the non-classical nature of the crystal dynamics. These results show that optical phonons in diamond provide a unique opportunity for the study of large-scale quantum behaviour, and highlight the potential for diamond as a micro-photonic quantum processor capable of operating at terahertz rates.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK"", ""authors"": [""K.

article,"Generating, manipulating and measuring entanglement and mixture with a reconfigurable photonic circuit","<p>Entanglement is the quintessential quantum-mechanical phenomenon understood to lie at the heart of future quantum technologies and the subject of fundamental scientific investigations. Mixture, resulting from noise, is often an unwanted result of interaction with an environment, but is also of fundamental interest, and is proposed to play a role in some biological processes. Here, we report an integrated waveguide device that can generate and completely characterize pure two-photon states with any amount of entanglement and arbitrary single-photon states with any amount of mixture. The device consists of a reconfigurable integrated quantum photonic circuit with eight voltage-controlled phase shifters. We demonstrate that, for thousands of randomly chosen configurations, the device performs with high fidelity. We generate maximally and non-maximally entangled states, violate a Bell-type inequality with a continuum of partially entangled states, and demonstrate the generation of arbitrary one-qubit mixed states.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""H.

article,Observation of bright polariton solitons in a semiconductor microcavity,"<p>Microcavity polaritons are composite half-light half-matter quasiparticles, which have recently been demonstrated to exhibit rich physical properties, such as non-equilibrium condensation, parametric scattering and superfluidity. At the same time, polaritons have important advantages over photons for information processing, because their excitonic component leads to weaker diffraction and stronger interparticle interactions, implying, respectively, tighter localization and lower powers for nonlinear functionality. Here, we present the first experimental observations of bright polariton solitons in a strongly coupled semiconductor microcavity. The polariton solitons are shown to be micrometre-scale localized non-diffracting wave packets with a corresponding broad spectrum in momentum space. Unlike the solitons known in Bose condensed atomic gases, they are non-equilibrium and rely on a balance between losses and external pumping. Microcavity polariton solitons are excited on picosecond timescales, and thus have further benefits for information processing over light-only solitons in semiconductor cavity lasers, which have nanosecond response times.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S3 7RH, UK"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Strong coupling between distant photonic nanocavities and its dynamic control,"<p>The formation of a coupled state among on-chip, photonic nanostructures at arbitrary positions as well as its dynamic control are important in the realization of next-generation photonic circuits with elevated functionality such as stopping/slowing of light and quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate that strong coupling and its dynamic control can be realized for distant, ultrahigh-Q photonic nanocavities. We use a pair of nanocavities with Q-factors exceeding 400,000, connected indirectly by a waveguide with a modified density of states. Surprisingly, even though the distance between the nanocavities exceeds 100 wavelengths, we clearly observe Rabi oscillation, indicating their strong coupling. This oscillation exchanges photons between the nanocavities with a period of 54&#160;ps while concentrating them in the nanocavities, not in the waveguide. In addition, by dynamically controlling the properties of either nanocavity, this exchange of photons can be stopped on demand, freezing the photon state.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yoshiya Sato"", "",\u00a0Yoshinori Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Jeremy Upham"", "",\u00a0Takashi Asano"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Susumu Noda""]}, {""address"": ""Photonics and Electronics Science and Engineering Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yoshinori Tanaka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Susumu Noda""]}, {""address"": ""Nanoscience & Nanotechnology Research Center, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, 599-8570, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yasushi Takahashi""]}]",False,"[""Yoshiya Sato"", ""Yoshinori Tanaka"", ""Jeremy Upham"", ""Yasushi Takahashi"", ""Takashi Asano"", ""Susumu Noda""]","Sato, Y., Tanaka, Y., Upham, J. et al.

article,A photon-driven micromotor can direct nerve fibre growth,"<p>Axonal path-finding is important in the development of the nervous system, nerve repair and nerve regeneration. The behaviour of the growth cone at the tip of the growing axon determines the direction of axonal growth and migration. We have developed an optical-based system to control the direction of growth of individual axons (nerve fibres) using laser-driven spinning birefringent spheres. One or two optical traps position birefringent beads adjacent to growth cones of cultured goldfish retinal ganglion cell axons. Circularly polarized light with angular momentum causes the trapped bead to spin. This creates a localized microfluidic flow generating an estimated 0.17&#160;pN shear force against the growth cone that turns in response to the shear. The direction of axonal growth can be precisely manipulated by changing the rotation direction and position of this optically driven micromotor. A physical model estimating the shear force density on the axon is described.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, 92617, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tao Wu"", "",\u00a0Samarendra Mohanty"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Michael W.
