review article,Dissipative solitons for mode-locked lasers,"<p>Dissipative solitons are localized formations of an electromagnetic field that are balanced through an energy exchange with the environment in presence of nonlinearity, dispersion and/or diffraction. Their growing use in the area of passively mode-locked lasers is remarkable: the concept of a dissipative soliton provides an excellent framework for understanding complex pulse dynamics and stimulates innovative cavity designs. Reciprocally, the field of mode-locked lasers serves as an ideal playground for testing the concept of dissipative solitons and revealing their unusual dynamics. This Review provides basic definitions of dissipative solitons, summarizes their implications for the design of high-energy mode-locked fibre laser cavities, highlights striking emerging dynamics such as dissipative soliton molecules, pulsations, explosions and rain, and finally provides an outlook for dissipative light bullets.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire Carnot de Bourgogne, UMR 5209 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne, BP 47870, Dijon Cedex, 21078, France"", ""authors"": [""Philippe Grelu""]}, {""address"": ""Optical Sciences Group, Research School of Physics and Engineering, Institute of Advanced Studies, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Nail Akhmediev""]}]",False,"[""Philippe Grelu"", ""Nail Akhmediev""]","Grelu, P., Akhmediev, N.

letter,Strongly correlated photons on a chip,"<p>Optical nonlinearities at the single-photon level are key ingredients for future photonic quantum technologies. Prime candidates for the realization of the strong photon&#8211;photon interactions necessary for implementing quantum information processing tasks, as well as for studying strongly correlated photons in an integrated photonic device setting, are quantum dots embedded in photonic-crystal nanocavities. Here, we report strong quantum correlations between photons on picosecond timescales. We observe (i) photon antibunching upon resonant excitation of the lowest-energy polariton state, proving that the first cavity photon blocks the subsequent injection events, and (ii) photon bunching when the laser field is in two-photon resonance with the polariton eigenstates of the second Jaynes&#8211;Cummings manifold, demonstrating that two photons at this colour are more likely to be injected into the cavity jointly than they would otherwise. Together, these results demonstrate unprecedented strong single-photon nonlinearities, paving the way for the realization of a quantum optical Josephson interferometer or a single-photon transistor.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Quantum Electronics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, 8093, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Andreas Reinhard"", "",\u00a0Thomas Volz"", "",\u00a0Martin Winger"", "",\u00a0Kevin J.

letter,Optical flywheels with attosecond jitter,"<p>It has been known for some time that the steady-state pulse propagating inside a mode-locked laser is the optical equivalent of a mechanical flywheel. By measuring the timing error spectrum between phase-locked optical pulse trains emitted from two nearly identical 10&#160;fs Ti:sapphire lasers, we demonstrate a record low integrated timing error of less than 13&#160;as, measured from d.c. to the Nyquist frequency of the pulse train, which is 41&#160;MHz. This corresponds to the lowest high-frequency phase noise ever recorded of &#8211;203&#160;dBc&#160;Hz<sup>&#8211;1</sup> (assuming a 10&#160;GHz carrier) for offset frequencies greater than 1&#160;MHz. Such a highly uniform train of pulses will enable the synchronization of pump&#8211;probe experiments that measure the evolution dynamics of chemical and atomic processes, evolving on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. The ultralow timing jitter of such pulse trains will also allow photonic analog-to-digital conversion of mid-infrared waveforms with a resolution of 6&#160;bits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Andrew J.

letter,Optical parametric oscillation with distributed feedback in cold atoms,"<p>There is currently a strong interest in mirrorless lasing systems, in which the electromagnetic feedback is provided either by disorder (multiple scattering in the gain medium) or by order (multiple Bragg reflection). These mechanisms correspond, respectively, to random lasers and photonic crystal lasers. The crossover regime between order and disorder, or correlated disorder, has also been investigated with some success. Here, we report one-dimensional photonic-crystal lasing (that is, distributed feedback lasing) with a cold atom cloud that simultaneously provides both gain and feedback. The atoms are trapped in a one-dimensional lattice, producing a density modulation that creates a strong Bragg reflection with a small angle of incidence. Pumping the atoms with auxiliary beams induces four-wave mixing, which provides parametric gain. The combination of both ingredients generates a mirrorless parametric oscillation with a conical output emission, the apex angle of which is tunable with the lattice periodicity.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physikalisches Institut, Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 14, T\u00fcbingen, D-72076, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Alexander Schilke"", "",\u00a0Claus Zimmermann"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0William Guerin""]}, {""address"": ""Instituto de F\u00edsica de S\u00e3o Carlos, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Carlos, 13560-970, SP, Brazil"", ""authors"": [""Philippe W.

letter,Extremely efficient flexible organic light-emitting diodes with modified graphene anode,"<p>Although graphene films have a strong potential to replace indium tin oxide anodes in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), to date, the luminous efficiency of OLEDs with graphene anodes has been limited by a lack of efficient methods to improve the low work function and reduce the sheet resistance of graphene films to the levels required for electrodes. Here, we fabricate flexible OLEDs by modifying the graphene anode to have a high work function and low sheet resistance, and thus achieve extremely high luminous efficiencies (37.2&#160;lm&#160;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup> in fluorescent OLEDs, 102.7&#160;lm&#160;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup> in phosphorescent OLEDs), which are significantly higher than those of optimized devices with an indium tin oxide anode (24.1&#160;lm&#160;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup> in fluorescent OLEDs, 85.6&#160;lm&#160;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup> in phosphorescent OLEDs).

letter,X-ray pump optical probe cross-correlation study of GaAs,"<p>Ultrafast dynamics in atomic, molecular and condensed-matter systems are increasingly being studied using optical-pump, X-ray probe techniques where subpicosecond laser pulses excite the system and X-rays detect changes in absorption spectra and local atomic structure. New opportunities are appearing as a result of improved synchrotron capabilities and the advent of X-ray free-electron lasers. These source improvements also allow for the reverse measurement: X-ray pump followed by optical probe. We describe here how an X-ray pump beam transforms a thin GaAs specimen from a strong absorber into a nearly transparent window in less than 100&#160;ps, for laser photon energies just above the bandgap. We find the opposite effect&#8212;X-ray induced optical opacity&#8212;for photon energies just below the bandgap. This raises interesting questions about the ultrafast many-body response of semiconductors to X-ray absorption, and provides a new approach for an X-ray/optical cross-correlator for synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, 47907, Indiana, USA"", ""authors"": [""S.

article,High-efficiency inverted dithienogermole–thienopyrrolodione-based polymer solar cells,"<p>Inverted polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells have received a great deal of attention because of their compatibility with large-scale roll-to-roll processing. The inverted cell geometry has the following structure: substrate (rigid or flexible)/indium tin oxide/electron-transporting layer/photoactive layer/hole-transporting layer/top anode. Solution-processed metal-oxide films, based on materials such as ZnO and TiO<sub>2</sub>, are typically used as the electron-transporting layers. Here, we demonstrate enhanced charge collection in inverted polymer solar cells using a surface-modified ZnO&#8211;polymer nanocomposite electron-transporting layer. Using this approach, we demonstrate inverted polymer solar cells based on a low-bandgap polymer with an alternating dithienogermole&#8211;thienopyrrolodione repeat unit (PDTG&#8211;TPD) with certified power conversion efficiencies of 7.4%. To our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency reported to date for polymer solar cells with a device architecture compatible with the roll-to-roll process.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Box 117200, Gainesville, 32611, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""Cephas E.

article,Greatly enhanced continuous-wave terahertz emission by nano-electrodes in a photoconductive photomixer,"<p>An efficient, room-temperature-operation continuous-wave terahertz source will greatly benefit compact terahertz system development for high-resolution terahertz spectroscopy and imaging applications. Here, we report highly efficient continuous-wave terahertz emission using nanogap electrodes in a photoconductive antenna-based photomixer. The tip-to-tip nanogap electrode structure provides strong terahertz field enhancement and acts as a nano-antenna to radiate the terahertz wave generated in the active region of the photomixer. In addition, it provides good impedance-matching to the terahertz planar antenna and exhibits a lower RC time constant, allowing more efficient radiation, especially at the higher part of the terahertz spectrum. As a result, the output power of the photomixer with the new nanogap electrode structure in the active region is two orders of magnitude higher than for a photomixer with typical interdigitated electrodes. The terahertz emission bandwidth also increases by a factor of more than two.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, 117602"", ""authors"": [""H.
