The potential applications of polymer solar cells are broad, ranging from flexible solar modules and semitransparent solar cells in windows, to building applications and even photon recycling in liquid-crystal displays. This Review covers the scientific origins and basic properties of polymer solar cell technology, material requirements and device operation mechanisms, while also providing a synopsis of major achievements in the field over the past few years.

review article,The renaissance of dye-sensitized solar cells,"<p>Several recent major advances in the design of dyes and electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells have led to record power-conversion efficiencies. Donor&#8211;pi&#8211;acceptor dyes absorb much more strongly than commonly employed ruthenium-based dyes, thereby allowing most of the visible spectrum to be absorbed in thinner films. Light-trapping strategies are also improving photon absorption in thin films. New cobalt-based redox couples are making it possible to obtain higher open-circuit voltages, leading to a new record power-conversion efficiency of 12.3%. Solid-state hole conductor materials also have the potential to increase open-circuit voltages and are making dye-sensitized solar cells more manufacturable. Engineering the interface between the titania and the hole transport material is being used to reduce recombination and thus attain higher photocurrents and open-circuit voltages. The combination of these strategies promises to provide much more efficient and stable solar cells, paving the way for large-scale commercialization.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""The Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Brian E.

letter,Spectral caustics in attosecond science,"<p>Many intriguing phenomena in nature&#8212;from phase transitions to black holes&#8212;occur at singularities. A unique type of singularity common in wave phenomena, known as caustics, links processes observed in many different branches of physics. Here, we investigate the role of caustics in attosecond science and in particular the physical process behind high harmonic generation. We experimentally demonstrate spectral focusing in high harmonic generation, showing a robust intensity enhancement of an order of magnitude over a spectral width of several harmonics. This new level of control holds promises in both scientific and technological aspects of attosecond science. Moreover, our study provides a deeper insight into the basic mechanism underlying the high harmonic generation process, revealing its quantum nature and universal properties.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel"", ""authors"": [""O.

letter,Integration of gigahertz-bandwidth semiconductor devices inside microstructured optical fibres,"<p>The prospect of an all-fibre optical communications network in which light can be generated, modulated and detected within the fibre itself without the need for discrete optoelectronic devices is an appealing one. However, to become a reality, this approach requires the incorporation of optoelectronic materials and functionalities into silica fibres to create a new breed of semiconductor&#8211;fibre hybrid devices for performing various tasks. Here, we report the integration of precisely doped semiconductor materials and high-quality rectifying semiconductor junctions into microstructured optical fibres, enabling high-speed, in-fibre functionalities such as photodetection at telecommunications wavelengths.

article,Tandem polymer solar cells featuring a spectrally matched low-bandgap polymer,"<p>Tandem solar cells provide an effective way to harvest a broader spectrum of solar radiation by combining two or more solar cells with different absorption bands. However, for polymer solar cells, the performance of tandem devices lags behind single-layer solar cells mainly due to the lack of a suitable low-bandgap polymer. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient single and tandem polymer solar cells featuring a low-bandgap conjugated polymer (PBDTT-DPP: bandgap, &#8764;1.44 eV). A single-layer device based on the polymer provides a power conversion efficiency of &#8764;6%. When the polymer is applied to tandem solar cells, a power conversion efficiency of 8.62% is achieved, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest certified efficiency for a polymer solar cell to date.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Letian Dou"", "",\u00a0Jingbi You"", "",\u00a0Jun Yang"", "",\u00a0Chun-Chao Chen"", "",\u00a0Youjun He"", "",\u00a0Seiichiro Murase"", "",\u00a0Gang Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yang Yang""]}, {""address"": ""National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, 80401, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tom Moriarty"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Keith Emery""]}, {""address"": ""California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yang Yang""]}]",False,"[""Letian Dou"", ""Jingbi You"", ""Jun Yang"", ""Chun-Chao Chen"", ""Youjun He"", ""Seiichiro Murase"", ""Tom Moriarty"", ""Keith Emery"", ""Gang Li"", ""Yang Yang""]","Dou, L., You, J., Yang, J. et al.

article,Comb-based radiofrequency photonic filters with rapid tunability and high selectivity,"<p>Photonic technologies have received considerable attention regarding the enhancement of radiofrequency electrical systems, including high-frequency analogue signal transmission, control of phased arrays, analog-to-digital conversion and signal processing. Although the potential of radiofrequency photonics for the implementation of tunable electrical filters over broad radiofrequency bandwidths has been much discussed, the realization of programmable filters with highly selective filter lineshapes and rapid reconfigurability has faced significant challenges. A new approach for radiofrequency photonic filters based on frequency combs offers a potential route to simultaneous high stopband attenuation, fast tunability and bandwidth reconfiguration. In one configuration, tuning of the radiofrequency passband frequency is demonstrated with unprecedented (&#8764;40 ns) speed by controlling the optical delay between combs. In a second, fixed filter configuration, cascaded four-wave mixing simultaneously broadens and smoothes the comb spectra, resulting in Gaussian radiofrequency filter lineshapes exhibiting an extremely high (&gt;60 dB) main lobe to sidelobe suppression ratio and (&gt;70 dB) stopband attenuation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA"", ""authors"": [""V.

article,Towards high-speed imaging of infrared photons with bio-inspired nanoarchitectures,"<p>Existing infrared detectors rely on complex microfabrication and thermal management methods. Here, we report an attractive platform of low-thermal-mass resonators inspired by the architectures of iridescent Morpho butterfly scales. In these resonators, the optical cavity is modulated by its thermal expansion and refractive index change, resulting in &#8216;wavelength conversion&#8217; of mid-wave infrared (3&#8211;8&#160;&#181;m) radiation into visible iridescence changes. By doping Morpho butterfly scales with single-walled carbon nanotubes, we achieved mid-wave infrared detection with 18&#8211;62&#160;mK temperature sensitivity and 35&#8211;40&#160;Hz heat-sink-free response speed.
