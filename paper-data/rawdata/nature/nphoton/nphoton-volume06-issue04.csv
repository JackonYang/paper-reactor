letter,Observation of eight-photon entanglement,"<p>The creation of increasingly large multipartite entangled states is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but is also the enabling technology for quantum information. Tremendous experimental effort has been devoted to generating multiparticle entanglement with a growing number of qubits. So far, up to six spatially separated single photons have been entangled based on parametric downconversion. Multiple degrees of freedom of a single photon have been exploited to generate forms of hyper-entangled states. Here, using new ultra-bright sources of entangled photon pairs, an eight-photon interferometer and post-selection detection, we demonstrate for the first time the creation of an eight-photon Schr&#246;dinger cat state with genuine multipartite entanglement. The ability to control eight individual photons represents a step towards optical quantum computation, and will enable new experiments on, for example, quantum simulation, topological error correction and testing entanglement dynamics under decoherence.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, Shanghai Branch, University of Science and Technology of China, Shanghai, 201315, China"", ""authors"": [""Xing-Can Yao"", "",\u00a0Tian-Xiong Wang"", "",\u00a0Ping Xu"", "",\u00a0He Lu"", "",\u00a0Ge-Sheng Pan"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Hui Bao"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", "",\u00a0Chao-Yang Lu"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ao Chen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}]",False,"[""Xing-Can Yao"", ""Tian-Xiong Wang"", ""Ping Xu"", ""He Lu"", ""Ge-Sheng Pan"", ""Xiao-Hui Bao"", ""Cheng-Zhi Peng"", ""Chao-Yang Lu"", ""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Yao, X., Wang, T., Xu, P. et al.

letter,Microfluidic directional emission control of an azimuthally polarized radial fibre laser,"<p>Lasers with cylindrically symmetric polarization states are predominantly based on whispering-gallery modes, characterized by high angular momentum and dominated by azimuthal emission. Here, a zero-angular-momentum laser with purely radial emission is demonstrated. An axially invariant, cylindrical photonic-bandgap fibre cavity filled with a microfluidic gain medium plug is axially pumped, resulting in a unique radiating field pattern characterized by cylindrical symmetry and a fixed polarization pointed in the azimuthal direction. Encircling the fibre core is an array of electrically contacted and independently addressable liquid-crystal microchannels embedded in the fibre cladding. These channels modulate the polarized wavefront emanating from the fibre core, leading to a laser with a dynamically controlled intensity distribution spanning the full azimuthal angular range. This new capability, implemented monolithically within a single fibre, presents opportunities ranging from flexible multidirectional displays to minimally invasive directed light delivery systems for medical applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alexander M.

letter,Heralded quantum entanglement between two crystals,"<p>Quantum networks must have the crucial ability to entangle quantum nodes. A prominent example is the quantum repeater, which allows the distance barrier of direct transmission of single photons to be overcome, provided remote quantum memories can be entangled in a heralded fashion. Here, we report the observation of heralded entanglement between two ensembles of rare-earth ions doped into separate crystals. A heralded single photon is sent through a 50/50 beamsplitter, creating a single-photon entangled state delocalized between two spatial modes. The quantum state of each mode is subsequently mapped onto a crystal, leading to an entangled state consisting of a single collective excitation delocalized between two crystals. This entanglement is revealed by mapping it back to optical modes and by estimating the concurrence of the retrieved light state. Our results highlight the potential of crystals doped with rare-earth ions for entangled quantum nodes and bring quantum networks based on solid-state resources one step closer.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Group of Applied Physics, University of Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Imam Usmani"", "",\u00a0Christoph Clausen"", "",\u00a0F\u00e9lix Bussi\u00e8res"", "",\u00a0Nicolas Sangouard"", "",\u00a0Mikael Afzelius"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Nicolas Gisin""]}]",False,"[""Imam Usmani"", ""Christoph Clausen"", ""F\u00e9lix Bussi\u00e8res"", ""Nicolas Sangouard"", ""Mikael Afzelius"", ""Nicolas Gisin""]","Usmani, I., Clausen, C., Bussières, F. et al.

letter,Cascaded single-photon emission from the Mollow triplet sidebands of a quantum dot,"<p>Emission from a resonantly excited quantum emitter is a fascinating research topic within the field of quantum optics and is a useful source for different types of quantum light fields. The resonance spectrum consists of a single spectral line that develops into a triplet above saturation of the quantum emitter. The three closely spaced photon channels from the resonance fluorescence have different photon statistical signatures. We present a detailed photon statistics analysis of the resonance fluorescence emission triplet from a solid-state-based artificial atom, that is, a semiconductor quantum dot. The photon correlation measurements demonstrate both &#8216;single&#8217; and &#8216;cascaded&#8217; photon emission from the Mollow triplet sidebands. The bright and narrow sideband emission (5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup> photons per second into the first lens) can be conveniently frequency-tuned by laser detuning over 15 times its linewidth (&#916;v&#160;&#8776;&#160;1.0&#160;GHz). These unique properties make the Mollow triplet sideband emission a valuable light source for quantum light spectroscopy and quantum information applications, for example.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Halbleiteroptik und Funktionelle Grenzfl\u00e4chen, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Allmandring 3, Stuttgart, 70569, Germany"", ""authors"": [""A.

letter,Frequency comb generation at terahertz frequencies by coherent phonon excitation in silicon,"<p>High-order nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions in gases enable the generation of X-ray and attosecond light pulses, metrology and spectroscopy. Optical nonlinearities in solid-state materials are particularly interesting for combining optical and electronic functions for high-bandwidth information processing. Third-order nonlinear optical processes in silicon have been used to process optical signals with bandwidths greater than 1&#160;GHz (ref.&#160;). However, fundamental physical processes for a silicon-based optical modulator in the terahertz bandwidth range have not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast phononic modulation of the optical index of silicon by irradiation with intense few-cycle femtosecond pulses. The anisotropic reflectivity modulation by the resonant Raman susceptibility at the fundamental frequency of the longitudinal optical phonon of silicon (15.6&#160;THz) generates a frequency comb up to seventh order. All-optical &gt;100&#160;THz frequency comb generation is realized by harnessing the coherent atomic motion of the silicon crystalline lattice at its highest mechanical frequency.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pittsburgh, 3941 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, 15260, Pennsylvania, USA"", ""authors"": [""Muneaki Hase"", "",\u00a0Anca Monia Constantinescu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hrvoje Petek""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Applied Physics, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, 305-8573, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Muneaki Hase""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Engineering Science, University of Electro-Communications, 1-5-1 Chofugaoka, Tokyo, 182-8585, Chofu, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Masayuki Katsuragawa""]}]",False,"[""Muneaki Hase"", ""Masayuki Katsuragawa"", ""Anca Monia Constantinescu"", ""Hrvoje Petek""]","Hase, M., Katsuragawa, M., Constantinescu, A. et al.

article,Ultralow-power all-optical RAM based on nanocavities,"<p>Optical random-access memory (o-RAM) has been regarded as one of the most difficult challenges in terms of replacing its various functionalities in electronic circuitry with their photonic counterparts. Nevertheless, it constitutes a key device in optical routing and processing. Here, we demonstrate that photonic crystal nanocavities with an ultrasmall buried heterostructure design can solve most of the problems encountered in previous o-RAMs. By taking advantage of the strong confinement of photons and carriers and allowing heat to escape efficiently, we have realized all-optical RAMs with a power consumption of only 30&#160;nW, which is more than 300 times lower than the previous record, and have achieved continuous operation. We have also demonstrated their feasibility in multibit integration. This paves the way for constructing a low-power large-scale o-RAM system that can handle high-bit-rate optical signals.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corp. 3-1, Morinosato Wakamiya Atsugi, Kanagawa, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kengo Nozaki"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corp. 3-1, Morinosato Wakamiya Atsugi, Kanagawa, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Shinji Matsuo"", "",\u00a0Yasumasa Suzaki"", "",\u00a0Toru Segawa"", "",\u00a0Tomonari Sato"", "",\u00a0Yoshihiro Kawaguchi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ryo Takahashi""]}]",False,"[""Kengo Nozaki"", ""Akihiko Shinya"", ""Shinji Matsuo"", ""Yasumasa Suzaki"", ""Toru Segawa"", ""Tomonari Sato"", ""Yoshihiro Kawaguchi"", ""Ryo Takahashi"", ""Masaya Notomi""]","Nozaki, K., Shinya, A., Matsuo, S. et al.

article,Organic light-emitting diodes employing efficient reverse intersystem crossing for triplet-to-singlet state conversion,"<p>Light emission from organic light-emitting diodes that make use of fluorescent materials have an internal quantum efficiency that is typically limited to no more than 25% due to the creation of non-radiative triplet excited states. Here, we report the use of electron-donating and electron-accepting molecules that allow a very high reverse intersystem crossing of 86.5% between non-radiative triplet and radiative singlet excited states and thus a means of achieving enhanced electroluminescence. Organic light-emitting diodes made using m-MTDATA as the donor material and 3TPYMB as the acceptor material demonstrate that external quantum efficiencies as high as 5.4% can be achieved, and we believe that the approach will offer even higher values in the future as a result of careful material selection.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics Research (OPERA), and Center for Future Chemistry, Kyushu University, 744 Motooka, Nishi, Fukuoka, 819-0395, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kenichi Goushi"", "",\u00a0Kou Yoshida"", "",\u00a0Keigo Sato"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Chihaya Adachi""]}]",False,"[""Kenichi Goushi"", ""Kou Yoshida"", ""Keigo Sato"", ""Chihaya Adachi""]","Goushi, K., Yoshida, K., Sato, K. et al.

article,"A comparison of graphene, superconductors and metals as conductors for metamaterials and plasmonics","<p>Recent advancements in metamaterials and plasmonics have promised a number of exciting applications, in particular at terahertz and optical frequencies. Unfortunately, the noble metals used in these photonic structures are not particularly good conductors at high frequencies, resulting in significant dissipative loss. Here, we address the question of what is a good conductor for metamaterials and plasmonics. For resonant metamaterials, we develop a figure-of-merit for conductors that allows for a straightforward classification of conducting materials according to the resulting dissipative loss in the metamaterial. Application of our method predicts that graphene and high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors are not viable alternatives for metals in metamaterials. We also provide an overview of a number of transition metals, alkali metals and transparent conducting oxides. For plasmonic systems, we predict that graphene and high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors cannot outperform gold as a platform for surface plasmon polaritons, because graphene has a smaller propagation length-to-wavelength ratio.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ames Laboratory\u2014US DOE and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, 50011, Iowa, USA"", ""authors"": [""Philippe Tassin"", "",\u00a0Thomas Koschny"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Costas M.
