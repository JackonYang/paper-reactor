review article,Controlling waves in space and time for imaging and focusing in complex media,"<p>In complex media such as white paint and biological tissue, light encounters nanoscale refractive-index inhomogeneities that cause multiple scattering. Such scattering is usually seen as an impediment to focusing and imaging. However, scientists have recently used strongly scattering materials to focus, shape and compress waves by controlling the many degrees of freedom in the incident waves. This was first demonstrated in the acoustic and microwave domains using time reversal, and is now being performed in the optical realm using spatial light modulators to address the many thousands of spatial degrees of freedom of light. This approach is being used to investigate phenomena such as optical super-resolution and the time reversal of light, thus opening many new avenues for imaging and focusing in turbid media.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Science and Technology and MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology, Complex Photonic Systems (COPS), University of Twente, PO Box 217, Enschede, 7500 AE, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Allard P.

letter,Observing the localization of light in space and time by ultrafast second-harmonic microscopy,"<p>Multiple coherent scattering and the constructive interference of certain scattering paths form the common scheme of several remarkable localization phenomena of classical and quantum waves in randomly disordered media. Prominent examples are electron transport in disordered conductors, the localization of excitons in semiconductor nanostructures, surface plasmon polaritons at rough metallic films or light in disordered dielectrics and amplifying media. However, direct observation of the fundamental spatiotemporal dynamics of the localization process remains challenging. This holds true, in particular, for the localization of light occurring on exceedingly short femtosecond timescales and nanometre length scales. Here, we combine second harmonic microscopy with few-cycle time resolution to probe the spatiotemporal localization of light waves in a random dielectric medium. We find lifetimes of the photon modes of several femtoseconds and a broad distribution of the local optical density of states, revealing central hallmarks of the localization of light.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Physik and Center of Interface Science, Carl von Ossietzky Universit\u00e4t, Oldenburg, 26129, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Manfred Mascheck"", "",\u00a0Slawa Schmidt"", "",\u00a0Martin Silies"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christoph Lienau""]}, {""address"": ""School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takashi Yatsui"", "",\u00a0Kokoro Kitamura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Motoichi Ohtsu""]}, {""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Physik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, 98684, Germany"", ""authors"": [""David Leipold"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Erich Runge""]}]",False,"[""Manfred Mascheck"", ""Slawa Schmidt"", ""Martin Silies"", ""Takashi Yatsui"", ""Kokoro Kitamura"", ""Motoichi Ohtsu"", ""David Leipold"", ""Erich Runge"", ""Christoph Lienau""]","Mascheck, M., Schmidt, S., Silies, M. et al.

letter,Electrically driven single-photon source at room temperature in diamond,"<p>Single-photon sources that provide non-classical light states on demand have a broad range of applications in quantum communication, quantum computing and metrology. Single-photon emission has been demonstrated using single atoms, ions, molecules, diamond colour centres and semiconductor quantum dots. Significant progress in highly efficient and entangled photons sources has recently been shown in semiconductor quantum dots; however, the requirement of cryogenic temperatures due to the necessity to confine carriers is a major obstacle. Here, we show the realization of a stable, room-temperature, electrically driven single-photon source based on a single neutral nitrogen-vacancy centre in a novel diamond diode structure. Remarkably, the generation of electroluminescence follows kinetics fundamentally different from that of photoluminescence with intra-bandgap excitation. This suggests electroluminescence is generated by electron&#8211;hole recombination at the defect. Our results prove that functional single defects can be integrated into electronic control structures, which is a crucial step towards elaborate quantum information devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University 1-3, Machikane-yama, Toyonaka-city, 560-8531, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""N.

letter,Giant half-cycle attosecond pulses,"<p>Half-cycle picosecond pulses have been produced from thin photoconductors when applying an electric field across the surface and switching on conduction using a short laser pulse. The transverse current in the wafer plane then emits half-cycle pulses in a normal direction, and pulses of 500&#160;fs duration and 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup>&#160;V&#160;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> peak electric field have been observed. Here, we show that single half-cycle pulses with a duration of 50&#160;as and up to 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>13</sup>&#160;V&#160;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> can be produced when irradiating a double foil target with intense few-cycle laser pulses. Focused onto an ultrathin foil, all electrons are blown out, forming a uniform sheet of relativistic electrons. A second layer, placed some distance behind, reflects the drive beam but lets electrons pass straight through. Under oblique incidence, beam reflection provides the transverse current, which emits intense half-cycle pulses. Such a pulse may completely ionize even heavier atoms. With these developments, new types of attosecond pump&#8211;probe experiments will become possible.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, 87545, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""H.-C.

letter,All-optical Compton gamma-ray source,"<p>One of the major goals of research for laser-plasma accelerators is the realization of compact sources of femtosecond X-rays. In particular, using the modest electron energies obtained with existing laser systems, Compton scattering a photon beam off a relativistic electron bunch has been proposed as a source of high-energy and high-brightness photons. However, laser-plasma based approaches to Compton scattering have not, to date, produced X-rays above 1&#160;keV. Here, we present a simple and compact scheme for a Compton source based on the combination of a laser-plasma accelerator and a plasma mirror. This approach is used to produce a broadband spectrum of X-rays extending up to hundreds of keV and with a 10,000-fold increase in brightness over Compton X-ray sources based on conventional accelerators. We anticipate that this technique will lead to compact, high-repetition-rate sources of ultrafast (femtosecond), tunable (X- through gamma-ray) and low-divergence (&#8764;1&#176;) photons from source sizes on the order of a micrometre.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire d'Optique Appliqu\u00e9e, ENSTA ParisTech, CNRS UMR7639, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France"", ""authors"": [""K.

letter,Structured illumination microscopy using unknown speckle patterns,"<p>Using spatially non-uniform illumination significantly improves the resolution of light microscopy. Indeed, frequency mixing between the object and the illumination permits the recovery of object frequencies beyond the diffraction-limited detection band pass. However, the image reconstruction process requires a precise knowledge of the illumination patterns (usually focused or periodic) and therefore sophisticated stable mountings. Here, we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that image reconstruction can be performed without knowing the illumination patterns, provided that their average is roughly homogeneous over the sample. Using blind structured illumination microscopy (blind-SIM), a resolution about two times better than that of conventional wide-field microscopy is obtained by simply illuminating the sample with several uncontrolled random speckles. Our approach is insensitive to specimen or aberration-induced illumination deformations, does not require any calibration step or stringent control of the illumination, and dramatically simplifies the experimental set-up.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut Fresnel (CNRS UMR 7249), Universit\u00e9 Aix-Marseille, Campus de St J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Marseille, 13013, France"", ""authors"": [""E.

article,Direct generation of multiple excitons in adjacent silicon nanocrystals revealed by induced absorption,"<p>The enhancement of carrier multiplication in semiconductor nanocrystals attracts a great deal of attention because of its potential in photovoltaic applications. Here, we present the results of investigations of a novel carrier multiplication mechanism recently proposed for closely spaced silicon nanocrystals in SiO<sub>2</sub> on the basis of photoluminescence. Using ultrafast pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy rigorously calibrated for the number of absorbed photons, we find that adjacent nanocrystals are excited directly upon absorption of a single high-energy photon. We demonstrate efficient carrier multiplication with an onset close to the energy conservation threshold of twice the bandgap, 2E<sub>g</sub>. Moreover, with absorption of a single high-energy photon under low pump fluence conditions, it was found that carrier&#8211;carrier interaction was significantly suppressed, but the amplitude of the signal was enhanced. We show that these results are in excellent agreement with the dependence of photoluminescence quantum yield on excitation, as reported previously for similar materials.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Van der Waals-Zeeman Institute, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, Amsterdam, 1098 XH, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Phase-locked coherent modes in a patterned metal–organic microcavity,"<p>Organic microcavities offer tantalizing prospects for studying the interactions of light and matter. For electrical excitation of these processes, electrodes must be integrated. However, the large absorption properties of metals are generally considered fatal for optical coherence. With this in mind, we embedded a thin silver grating into an organic microcavity to generate periodic arrays of localized cavity modes and metal-based Tamm plasmon polaritons. These excited states are capable of phase coupling across the grating. At room temperature and under non-resonant pumping, we selectively stimulated coherent emission from in- and out-of-phase locked arrays. We show that an absorptive metal inside an optical cavity is compatible with coherent emission. Most importantly, the inherently low residual absorption of the organic layer enables coherence to spread over macroscopic distances, even at room temperature. Our strategy of embedding metal patterns into an organic microcavity yields a viable route towards electrically driven organic solid-state lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Angewandte Photophysik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, 01062, Germany"", ""authors"": [""R.

article,Wrinkles and deep folds as photonic structures in photovoltaics,"<p>Some of the simplest light-harvesting systems in nature rely on the presence of surface structures to increase internal light scattering. We have extended this concept to increase the efficiencies of man-made solar energy harvesting systems. Specifically, we exploit the wrinkles and deep folds that form on polymer surfaces when subjected to mechanical stress to guide and retain light within the photo-active regions of photovoltaics. Devices constructed on such surfaces show substantial improvements in light harvesting efficiencies, particularly in the near-infrared region where light absorption is otherwise minimal. We report a vast increase in the external quantum efficiency of polymer photovoltaics by more than 600% in the near-infrared, where the useful range of solar energy conversion is extended by more than 200&#160;nm. This method of exploiting elastic instabilities of thin, layered materials is straightforward and represents an economical route to patterning photonic structures over large areas to improve the performance of optoelectronics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jong Bok Kim"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yueh-Lin Loo""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Pilnam Kim"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Howard A.
