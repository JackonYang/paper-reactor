letter,Speckle-free laser imaging using random laser illumination,"<p>Many imaging applications require increasingly bright illumination sources, motivating the replacement of conventional thermal light sources with bright light-emitting diodes, superluminescent diodes and lasers. Despite their brightness, lasers and superluminescent diodes are poorly suited for full-field imaging applications because their high spatial coherence leads to coherent artefacts such as speckle that corrupt image formation. We recently demonstrated that random lasers can be engineered to provide low spatial coherence. Here, we exploit the low spatial coherence of specifically designed random lasers to demonstrate speckle-free full-field imaging in the setting of intense optical scattering. We quantitatively show that images generated with random laser illumination exhibit superior quality than images generated with spatially coherent illumination. By providing intense laser illumination without the drawback of coherent artefacts, random lasers are well suited for a host of full-field imaging applications from full-field microscopy to digital light projector systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Yale University, New Haven, 06520, Connecticut, USA"", ""authors"": [""Brandon Redding"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hui Cao""]}, {""address"": ""Departments of Diagnostic Radiology and of Pediatrics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, 06520, Connecticut, USA"", ""authors"": [""Michael A.

letter,First lasing of an echo-enabled harmonic generation free-electron laser,"<p>Free-electron lasers have been successfully operated with ultrahigh brightness and excellent transverse coherence at X-ray wavelengths. One of the next goals for further improvements is full coherence. An obvious approach is to seed the free-electron laser interaction using a conventional source that has good temporal coherence. Here, we show the first lasing of a free-electron laser with an echo-enabled harmonic generation scheme, which shows great promise for producing coherent lasing at short wavelengths, even in the X-ray regime. The experiment was conducted at a test facility that combines a 135.4 MeV electron accelerator with an amplifier consisting of a series of undulator magnets. Lasing was achieved at the third harmonic of the seed with a gain of &#8764;100,000 over spontaneous radiation. The measurements show typical exponential growth and excellent spectral characteristics, as well as good intensity stability.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2019 Jialuo Road, Shanghai, 201800, China"", ""authors"": [""Z.

letter,Mapping coherence in measurement via full quantum tomography of a hybrid optical detector,"<p>Quantum states and measurements exhibit wave-like (continuous) or particle-like (discrete) character. Hybrid discrete&#8211;continuous photonic systems are key to investigating fundamental quantum phenomena, generating superpositions of macroscopic states, and form essential resources for quantum-enhanced applications such as entanglement distillation and quantum computation, as well as highly efficient optical telecommunications. Realizing the full potential of these hybrid systems requires quantum-optical measurements sensitive to non-commuting observables such as field quadrature amplitude and photon number. However, a thorough understanding of the practical performance of an optical detector interpolating between these two regions is absent. Here, we report the implementation of full quantum detector tomography, enabling the characterization of the simultaneous wave and photon-number sensitivities of quantum-optical detectors. This yields the largest parameterization to date in quantum tomography experiments, requiring the development of novel theoretical tools. Our results reveal the role of coherence in quantum measurements and demonstrate the tunability of hybrid quantum-optical detectors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK"", ""authors"": [""Lijian Zhang"", "",\u00a0Hendrik B.

letter,Chemically etched ultrahigh-Q wedge-resonator on a silicon chip,"<p>Ultrahigh-Q optical resonators are being studied across a wide range of fields, including quantum information, nonlinear optics, cavity optomechanics and telecommunications. Here, we demonstrate a new resonator with a record Q-factor of 875 million for on-chip devices. The fabrication of our device avoids the requirement for a specialized processing step, which in microtoroid resonators has made it difficult to control their size and achieve millimetre- and centimetre-scale diameters. Attaining these sizes is important in applications such as microcombs and potentially also in rotation sensing. As an application of size control, stimulated Brillouin lasers incorporating our device are demonstrated. The resonators not only set a new benchmark for the Q-factor on a chip, but also provide, for the first time, full compatibility of this important device class with conventional semiconductor processing. This feature will greatly expand the range of possible &#8216;system on a chip&#8217; functions enabled by ultrahigh-Q devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""T. J.

article,Optical codeword demodulation with error rates below the standard quantum limit using a conditional nulling receiver,"<p>The quantum states of two laser pulses&#8212;coherent states&#8212;are never mutually orthogonal, making perfect discrimination impossible. Even so, coherent states can achieve the ultimate quantum limit for capacity of a classical channel, the Holevo capacity. Attaining this requires the receiver to make joint-detection measurements on long codeword blocks, optical implementations of which remain unknown. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of a joint-detection receiver, demodulating quaternary pulse-position-modulation codewords at a word error rate of up to 40% (2.2&#160;dB) below that attained with direct detection, the largest error-rate improvement over the standard quantum limit reported to date. This is accomplished with a conditional nulling receiver, which uses optimized-amplitude coherent pulse nulling, single photon detection and quantum feedforward. We further show how this translates into coding complexity improvements for practical pulse-position-modulation systems, such as in deep-space communication. We anticipate our experiment to motivate future work towards building Holevo-capacity-achieving joint-detection receivers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Disruptive Information Processing Technologies group, Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jian Chen"", "",\u00a0Jonathan L.

article,An invisible metal–semiconductor photodetector,"<p>Nanotechnology has enabled the realization of hybrid devices and circuits in which nanoscale metal and semiconductor building blocks are woven together in a highly integrated fashion. In electronics, it is well known how the distinct material-dependent properties of metals and semiconductors can be combined to realize important functionalities, including transistors, memory and logic. We describe an optoelectronic device for which the geometrical properties of the constituent semiconductor and metallic nanostructures are tuned in conjunction with the materials properties to realize multiple functions in the same physical space. In particular, we demonstrate a photodetector in which the nanoscale electrical contacts have been designed to render the device &#8216;invisible&#8217; over a broad frequency range. The structure belongs to a new class of devices that capitalize on the notion that nanostructures have a limited number of resonant, geometrically tunable optical modes whose hybridization and intermodal interference can be tailored in a myriad of useful ways.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials, Stanford University, California, 94305, USA"", ""authors"": [""Pengyu Fan"", "",\u00a0Linyou Cao"", "",\u00a0Farzaneh Afshinmanesh"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mark L.

article,Laser-driven acceleration of neutral particles,"<p>Precise control over the translational motion of atoms and molecules is important for a large range of scientific and industrial processes. Applications range from surface growth and deposition to elucidating the details of chemical reactions through controlled collisions. The critical challenge faced by many experiments is the production of a beam of particles with a narrow velocity spread, a precisely controlled mean velocity, and sufficient flux over a wide range. We demonstrate this fine control of velocity using strong optical fields that trap and accelerate particles up to velocities of hundreds of metres per second. This acceleration occurs over tens of nanoseconds and on micrometre length scales. Particle velocity can be continuously tuned over a wide range while maintaining a narrow velocity spread. Our method is very general and will allow acceleration or deceleration of a wide variety of neutral atomic and molecular species, as well as nanoscale particles.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"", ""authors"": [""C.

article,Photovoltaic retinal prosthesis with high pixel density,"<p>Retinal degenerative diseases lead to blindness due to loss of the &#8216;image capturing&#8217; photoreceptors, while neurons in the &#8216;image-processing&#8217; inner retinal layers are relatively well preserved. Electronic retinal prostheses seek to restore sight by electrically stimulating the surviving neurons. Most implants are powered through inductive coils, requiring complex surgical methods to implant the coil-decoder-cable-array systems that deliver energy to stimulating electrodes via intraocular cables. We present a photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis, in which silicon photodiodes in each pixel receive power and data directly through pulsed near-infrared illumination and electrically stimulate neurons. Stimulation is produced in normal and degenerate rat retinas, with pulse durations of 0.5&#8211;4&#160;ms, and threshold peak irradiances of 0.2&#8211;10&#160;mW&#160;mm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, two orders of magnitude below the ocular safety limit. Neural responses were elicited by illuminating a single 70&#160;&#181;m bipolar pixel, demonstrating the possibility of a fully integrated photovoltaic retinal prosthesis with high pixel density.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory, 452 Lomita Mall, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305-4085, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Keith Mathieson"", "",\u00a0James Loudin"", "",\u00a0Georges Goetz"", "",\u00a0Philip Huie"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Daniel Palanker""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Ophthalmology, The Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University, 2452 Watson Court, Palo Alto, 94303, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""James Loudin"", "",\u00a0Philip Huie"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Daniel Palanker""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, 350 Serra Mall, Stanford, 94305-9505, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Georges Goetz"", "",\u00a0Lele Wang"", "",\u00a0Theodore I.

article,A micromachining-based technology for enhancing germanium light emission via tensile strain,"<p>Germanium is an attractive material for silicon-compatible optoelectronics, but in its bulk form it does not emit light efficiently because of its indirect bandgap. Applying tensile strain to germanium modifies its band structure such that radiative recombination is enhanced, leading to improved light emission. Here, we introduce the &#8216;suspension platform for optoelectronics under tension&#8217;, a micromachining-based technology that applies large, locally tunable tensile strains to suspended device layers. Using this approach, we demonstrate dramatically enhanced light emission from uniaxially and biaxially tensile-strained germanium-on-insulator device layers. Photoluminescence enhanced by a factor of 130 at a wavelength of 1,550&#160;nm and integrated enhancement by greater than a factor of 260 over bulk germanium are described. The emission exhibits a superlinear dependence on optical pump power. We also report preliminary evidence for enhanced electroluminescence from suspended germanium-on-insulator light-emitting diodes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jinendra Raja Jain"", "",\u00a0David A.
