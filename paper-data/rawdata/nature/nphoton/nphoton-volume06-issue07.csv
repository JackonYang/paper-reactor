letter,Experimental realization of three-dimensional indefinite cavities at the nanoscale with anomalous scaling laws,"<p>Metamaterials allow for extraordinary electromagnetic properties that are not attainable in nature. Indefinite media with hyperbolic dispersion, in particular, have found intriguing applications. The miniaturization of optical cavities increases the photon density of states and therefore enhances light&#8211;matter interactions for applications in modern optoelectronics. However, scaling down the optical cavity is limited to the diffraction limit and by the reduced quality factor. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an optical cavity made of indefinite metamaterials that confines the electromagnetic field to an extremely small space. The experiments reveal that indefinite cavities demonstrate anomalous scaling laws: cavities with different sizes can resonant at the same frequency, and a higher-order resonance mode oscillates at a lower frequency. We also demonstrate a universal fourth power law for the radiation quality factor of the wave vector. Cavities with sizes down to &#955;/12 are realized with ultrahigh optical indices (up to 17.4), a feature that is critically important for many applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiaodong Yang"", "",\u00a0Xiaobo Yin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xiang Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""NSF Nano-scale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC), 3112 Etcheverry Hall, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiaodong Yang"", "",\u00a0Jie Yao"", "",\u00a0Junsuk Rho"", "",\u00a0Xiaobo Yin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xiang Zhang""]}]",False,"[""Xiaodong Yang"", ""Jie Yao"", ""Junsuk Rho"", ""Xiaobo Yin"", ""Xiang Zhang""]","Yang, X., Yao, J., Rho, J. et al.

letter,Avalanche amplification of a single exciton in a semiconductor nanowire,"<p>Interfacing single photons and electrons is a crucial element in sharing quantum information between remote solid-state qubits. Semiconductor nanowires offer the unique possibility of combining optical quantum dots with avalanche photodiodes, thus enabling the conversion of an incoming single photon into a macroscopic current for efficient electrical detection. Currently, millions of excitation events are required to perform electrical readout of an exciton qubit state. Here, we demonstrate multiplication of carriers from only a single exciton generated in a quantum dot after tunnelling into a nanowire avalanche photodiode. Owing to the large amplification of both electrons and holes (&gt;10<sup>4</sup>), we reduce by four orders of magnitude the number of excitation events required to electrically detect a single exciton generated in a quantum dot. This work represents a significant step towards achieving single-shot electrical readout and offers a new functionality for on-chip quantum information circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, 2628 CJ Delft, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Gabriele Bulgarini"", "",\u00a0Michael E.

letter,Large spontaneous emission enhancement in plasmonic nanocavities,"<p>Cavity&#8211;emitter coupling can enable a host of potential applications in quantum optics, from low-threshold lasers to brighter single-photon sources for quantum cryptography. Although some of the first demonstrations of spontaneous emission modification occurred in metallic structures, it was only after the recent demonstration of cavity quantum electrodynamics effects in dielectric optical cavities that metal-based optical cavities were considered for quantum optics applications. Advantages of metal&#8211;optical cavities include their compatibility with a large variety of emitters and their broadband cavity spectra, which enable enhancement of spectrally broad emitters. Here, we demonstrate radiative emission rate enhancements approaching 1,000 for emitters coupled to the nanoscale gap between a silver nanowire and a silver substrate. A quantitative comparison of our results with analytical theory shows that the enhanced emission rate of gap-mode plasmons in our structures can yield high internal quantum efficiency despite the close proximity of metal surfaces.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 9 Oxford Street, McKay Laboratory, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kasey J.

letter,Fluctuations and correlations in modulation instability,"<p>Stochastically driven nonlinear processes are responsible for spontaneous pattern formation and instabilities in numerous natural and artificial systems, including well-known examples such as sand ripples, cloud formations, water waves, animal pigmentation and heart rhythms. Technologically, a type of such self-amplification drives free-electron lasers and optical supercontinuum sources whose radiation qualities, however, suffer from the stochastic origins. Through time-resolved observations, we identify intrinsic properties of these fluctuations that are hidden in ensemble measurements. We acquire single-shot spectra of modulation instability produced by laser pulses in glass fibre at megahertz real-time capture rates. The temporally confined nature of the gain physically limits the number of amplified modes, which form an antibunched arrangement as identified from a statistical analysis of the data.

letter,"Nanonewton optical force trap employing anti-reflection coated, high-refractive-index titania microspheres","<p>Optical tweezers are exquisite position and force transducers and are widely used for high-resolution measurements in fields as varied as physics, biology and materials science. Typically, small dielectric particles are trapped in a tightly focused laser and are often used as handles for sensitive force measurements. Improvement to the technique has largely focused on improving the instrument and shaping the light beam, and there has been little work exploring the benefit of customizing the trapped object. Here, we describe how anti-reflection coated, high-refractive-index core&#8211;shell particles composed of titania enable single-beam optical trapping with an optical force greater than a nanonewton. The increased force range broadens the scope of feasible optical trapping experiments and will pave the way towards more efficient light-powered miniature machines, tools and applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nanomechanics Group, Biotechnology Center, TU Dresden, Tatzberg 47/49, Dresden, 01307, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Anita Jannasch"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Erik Sch\u00e4ffer""]}, {""address"": ""Soft Condensed Matter, Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University, Princetonplein 5, CC Utrecht, 3584, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Ahmet F.

article,Phase-space measurement and coherence synthesis of optical beams,"<p>Phase-space optics allows the simultaneous visualization of both space (x) and spatial frequency (k) information. Previous experiments have focused mainly on coherent beams, which are fully described by a two-dimensional complex field (amplitude and phase). In contrast, partially coherent beams inherently have more degrees of freedom and require a four-dimensional description. This description is particularly important for propagation, in which coherence properties determine the intensity evolution. Despite this, most measurements in linear optics, and all those in nonlinear optics, have recorded only the intensity and power spectrum projections (x-space or k-space only). Measuring local coherence remains a challenging problem, especially in the full four-dimensional phase space. In turn, the recording difficulty has limited efforts to generate arbitrary, spatially varying patterns of coherence, despite their usefulness for imaging, illumination and display.

article,Universal formation dynamics and noise of Kerr-frequency combs in microresonators,"<p>Optical frequency combs allow for the precise measurement of optical frequencies and are used in a growing number of applications. The new class of Kerr-frequency comb sources, based on parametric frequency conversion in optical microresonators, can complement conventional systems in applications requiring high repetition rates such as direct comb spectroscopy, spectrometer calibration, arbitrary optical waveform generation and advanced telecommunications. However, a severe limitation in experiments working towards practical systems is phase noise, observed in the form of linewidth broadening, multiple repetition-rate beat notes and loss of temporal coherence. These phenomena are not explained by the current theory of Kerr comb formation, yet understanding this is crucial to the maturation of Kerr comb technology. Here, based on observations in crystalline MgF<sub>2</sub> and planar Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> microresonators, we reveal the universal, platform-independent dynamics of Kerr comb formation, allowing the explanation of a wide range of phenomena not previously understood, as well as identifying the condition for, and transition to, low-phase-noise performance.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""T.

article,Terabit free-space data transmission employing orbital angular momentum multiplexing,"<p>The recognition in the 1990s that light beams with a helical phase front have orbital angular momentum has benefited applications ranging from optical manipulation to quantum information processing. Recently, attention has been directed towards the opportunities for harnessing such beams in communications. Here, we demonstrate that four light beams with different values of orbital angular momentum and encoded with 42.8&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) signals can be multiplexed and demultiplexed, allowing a 1.37&#160;Tbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> aggregated rate and 25.6&#160;bit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1</sup> spectral efficiency when combined with polarization multiplexing. Moreover, we show scalability in the spatial domain using two groups of concentric rings of eight polarization-multiplexed 20&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> 16-QAM-carrying orbital angular momentum beams, achieving a capacity of 2.56&#160;Tbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and spectral efficiency of 95.7&#160;bit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. We also report data exchange between orbital angular momentum beams encoded with 100&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> differential quadrature phase-shift keying signals. These demonstrations suggest that orbital angular momentum could be a useful degree of freedom for increasing the capacity of free-space communications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, 90089, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jian Wang"", "",\u00a0Jeng-Yuan Yang"", "",\u00a0Irfan M.
