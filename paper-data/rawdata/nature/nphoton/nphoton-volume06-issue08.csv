review article,Artificial photosynthesis for solar water-splitting,"<p>Hydrogen generated from solar-driven water-splitting has the potential to be a clean, sustainable and abundant energy source. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, artificial solar water-splitting devices are now being designed and tested. Recent developments based on molecular and/or nanostructure designs have led to advances in our understanding of light-induced charge separation and subsequent catalytic water oxidation and reduction reactions. Here we review some of the recent progress towards developing artificial photosynthetic devices, together with their analogies to biological photosynthesis, including technologies that focus on the development of visible-light active hetero-nanostructures and require an understanding of the underlying interfacial carrier dynamics. Finally, we propose a vision for a future sustainable hydrogen fuel community based on artificial photosynthesis.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, RMIT University, Bundoora, 3083, Victoria, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Yasuhiro Tachibana""]}, {""address"": ""Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho Kawaguchi, 332-0012, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yasuhiro Tachibana""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Advanced Science and Innovation (CASI), Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-Oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yasuhiro Tachibana""]}, {""address"": ""International Research Center for Renewable Energy, State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow in Power Engineering, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Xian Jiaotong University, 710049, Xi'an, China"", ""authors"": [""Lionel Vayssieres""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, London, SW7 2AZ, UK"", ""authors"": [""James R.

letter,All-optical wavelength shifting in a semiconductor laser using resonant nonlinearities,"<p>For future ultrafast all-optical networks, new optical devices are required that can directly manipulate communication channels and shift their wavelength over the bandwidth of an optical fibre (50&#160;THz). Solutions based on nonlinear processes have been proposed, but these suffer from having only low efficiencies as a result of low nonlinear susceptibilities. Here, we demonstrate all-optical wavelength conversion of a near-infrared beam using a resonant nonlinear process within a terahertz quantum cascade laser. The process is based on injecting a low-power continuous-wave near-infrared beam in resonance with the interband transitions of the quantum cascade laser. This results in an enhanced nonlinearity that allows efficient generation of the difference and sum frequency, shifting the frequency of the near-infrared beam by the frequency of the quantum cascade laser. Efficiencies of 0.13% are demonstrated, which are equivalent to those obtained using free electron lasers. As well as having important implications in its application in ultrafast wavelength shifting, this work also opens up the possibility of efficiently upconverting terahertz radiation to the near-infrared and enables the study of high terahertz&#8211;optical field interactions with quantum structures using quantum cascade lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Pierre Aigrain, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, UMR 8551 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 P. et M.

letter,Quantum-limited frequency fluctuations in a terahertz laser,"<p>Quantum cascade lasers can be considered the primary achievement of electronic band structure engineering, showing how artificial materials can be created through quantum design to have tailor-made properties that are otherwise non-existent in nature. Indeed, quantum cascade lasers can be used as powerful testing grounds of the fundamental physical parameters determined by their quantum nature, including the intrinsic linewidth of laser emission, which in such lasers is significantly affected by the optical and thermal photon number generated in the laser cavity. Here, we report experimental evidence of linewidth values approaching the quantum limit in far-infrared quantum cascade lasers. Despite the broadening induced by thermal photons, the measured linewidth results narrower than that found in any other semiconductor laser to date. By performing noise measurements with unprecedented sensitivity levels, we highlight the key role of gain medium engineering and demonstrate that properly designed semiconductor-heterostructure lasers can unveil the mechanisms underlying the laser-intrinsic phase noise, revealing the link between device properties and the quantum-limited linewidth.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CNR- Istituto Nazionale di Ottica and LENS (European Laboratory for Non-linear Spectroscopy), Via Carrara 1, Sesto Fiorentino (FI), 50019, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Miriam S.

letter,Solution-processed inorganic bulk nano-heterojunctions and their application to solar cells,"<p>In the last decade, solution-processed quantum dot/nanocrystal solar cells have emerged as a very promising technology for third-generation thin-film photovoltaics because of their low cost and high energy-harnessing potential. Quantum dot solar cell architectures developed to date have relied on the use of bulk-like thin films of colloidal quantum dots. Here, we introduce the bulk nano-heterojunction concept for inorganic solution-processed semiconductors. This platform can be readily implemented by mixing different semiconductor nanocrystals in solution and allows for the development of optoelectronic nanocomposite materials with tailored optoelectronic properties. We present bulk nano-heterojunction solar cells based on n-type Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> nanocrystals and p-type PbS quantum dots, which demonstrate a more than a threefold improvement in device performance compared to their bilayer analogue, as a result of suppressed recombination.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO \u2013 Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies Fot\u00f2niques, Mediterranean Technology Park, Castelldefels, 08860, Barcelona, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Arup K.

Here, we demonstrate such thermal emission control by manipulating photonic modes with photonic crystals as well as material absorption with quantum-well intersubband transitions. We show that the emission peak intensity for our device can be more than four times greater than that of a blackbody sample under the same input power and thermal management conditions due to an increase in the temperature compared to the blackbody reference, and the emission bandwidth and angular spread are narrowed by a factor of 30 and 8, respectively.

letter,Detection of photons emitted from single erbium atoms in energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,"<p>The detection of photons emitted from single quantum objects is highly desirable for the diagnosis of nanoscale devices using microscopes. An extremely tiny probe (&#8764;0.1 nm) with high current recently became available for aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and it is possible for individual atoms in nanoscale devices to be excited using such a highly focused probe. Here, we demonstrate the successful detection of characteristic X-ray signals from single erbium atoms using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The intensities of the erbium L and M lines from a single erbium atom were extremely weak in comparison to the N edge of electron energy-loss spectroscopy, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty in sensing single atoms using X-ray spectroscopy. Nevertheless, this work will certainly help in the advance towards obtaining X-ray spectra from single atoms and to evaluate the fluorescence yield on a single-atom basis.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nanotube Research Center, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, 305-8565, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazu Suenaga"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Toshiya Okazaki""]}, {""address"": ""Electron Optics Division, JEOL Ltd, Akishima, 196-8558, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Eiji Okunishi""]}, {""address"": ""HVEM Laboratory, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 819-0395, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Syo Matsumura""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Applied Quantum Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 819-0395, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Syo Matsumura""]}]",False,"[""Kazu Suenaga"", ""Toshiya Okazaki"", ""Eiji Okunishi"", ""Syo Matsumura""]","Suenaga, K., Okazaki, T., Okunishi, E. et al.

letter,Looking around corners and through thin turbid layers in real time with scattered incoherent light,"<p>Imaging with optical resolution through turbid media is a long sought-after goal with important applications in deep tissue imaging. Although extensively studied, this goal was considered impractical until recently. Adaptive-optics techniques, which can correct weak aberrations, are inadequate for turbid samples, where light is scattered to complex speckle patterns with a number of modes greatly exceeding the number of degrees of control. This conception changed after the demonstration of coherent focusing through turbid media by wavefront-shaping, using spatial light modulators. Here, we show that wavefront-shaping enables wide-field imaging through turbid layers with incoherent illumination, and imaging of occluded objects using light scattered from diffuse walls. In contrast to the recently introduced schemes for imaging through turbid media, our technique does not require coherent sources, interferometric detection, raster-scanning or off-line reconstruction. Our results bring wavefront-shaping closer to practical applications and realize the vision of looking through &#8216;walls&#8217; and around corners.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Ori Katz"", "",\u00a0Eran Small"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yaron Silberberg""]}]",False,"[""Ori Katz"", ""Eran Small"", ""Yaron Silberberg""]","Katz, O., Small, E. & Silberberg, Y.

article,Regenerative oscillation and four-wave mixing in graphene optoelectronics,"<p>The unique linear and massless band structure of graphene in a purely two-dimensional Dirac fermionic structure has led to intense research in fields ranging from condensed matter physics to nanoscale device applications covering the electrical, thermal, mechanical and optical domains. Here, we report three consecutive first observations in graphene&#8211;silicon hybrid optoelectronic devices&#8212;ultralow-power resonant optical bistability, self-induced regenerative oscillations and coherent four-wave mixing&#8212;all at few-femtojoule cavity recirculating energies. These observations, in comparison with control measurements on solely monolithic silicon cavities, are enabled only by the dramatically large and ultrafast &#967;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearities in graphene and the large Q/V ratios in wavelength-localized photonic crystal cavities.

article,Broadband dye-sensitized upconversion of near-infrared light,"<p>Photon upconversion of near-infrared photons is a promising way to overcome the Shockley&#8211;Queisser efficiency limit of 32% of a single-junction solar cell. However, the practical applicability of the most efficient known upconversion materials at moderate light intensities is limited by their extremely weak and narrowband near-infrared absorption. Here, we introduce the concept of an upconversion material where an organic near-infrared dye is used as an antenna for the &#946;-NaYF<sub>4</sub>:Yb,Er nanoparticles in which the upconversion occurs. The overall upconversion by the dye-sensitized nanoparticles is dramatically enhanced (by a factor of &#8764;3,300) as a result of increased absorptivity and overall broadening of the absorption spectrum of the upconverter. The proposed concept can be extended to cover any part of the solar spectrum by using a set of dye molecules with overlapping absorption spectra acting as an extremely broadband antenna system, connected to suitable upconverters.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Stratingh Institute for Chemistry, University of Groningen, Nijenborgh 4, Groningen, 9747 AG, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Wenqiang Zou"", "",\u00a0Cindy Visser"", "",\u00a0Jeremio A.
