letter,Maximal energy transport through disordered media with the implementation of transmission eigenchannels,"<p>Complex media such as random nanostructures and biological tissues induce multiple wave scattering, which interrupts the propagation of waves and attenuates energy transmission. Even for a highly disordered medium, however, it is possible in principle to enhance the delivery of energy to the far side of the medium. Similar to the resonator modes in linear optical cavities, specific modes called eigenchannels exist in a disordered medium and have extraordinarily high transmission. In this Letter, we report the first experimental realization of transmission eigenchannels in a disordered medium and show that an eigenchannel transports 3.99 times more energy than uncontrolled waves, which is the best experimental record reported to date. Our study will open up new avenues for enhancing light energy delivery to biological tissues for medical purposes and for controlling the lasing threshold in random lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, 136-701, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Moonseok Kim"", "",\u00a0Youngwoon Choi"", "",\u00a0Changhyeong Yoon"", "",\u00a0Wonjun Choi"", "",\u00a0Q-Han Park"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wonshik Choi""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Myongji University, Yongin, 449-728, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jaisoon Kim""]}]",False,"[""Moonseok Kim"", ""Youngwoon Choi"", ""Changhyeong Yoon"", ""Wonjun Choi"", ""Jaisoon Kim"", ""Q-Han Park"", ""Wonshik Choi""]","Kim, M., Choi, Y., Yoon, C. et al.

letter,Three-dimensional coherent X-ray surface scattering imaging near total external reflection,"<p>Lensless X-ray coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) has emerged as a thriving field promising applications in materials and biological sciences with a theoretical imaging resolution only limited by the X-ray wavelength. Most CDI methods use transmission geometry, which is not suitable for nanostructures grown on opaque substrates or for objects of interest comprising only surfaces or interfaces. Attempts have been made to perform CDI experiments in reflection geometry, both optically and with X-rays, but the reconstruction resulted in mostly planar images, with less success in the third dimension. Here, we discuss the development of coherent surface scattering imaging in grazing-incidence geometry that takes advantage of enhanced X-ray surface scattering and interference near total external reflection. We demonstrate the successful reconstruction of substrate-supported non-periodic surface patterns in three dimensions with nanometre resolution in the direction normal to the substrate, promising wide applications in elucidating structures in substrate-supported and buried nanoelectronics and photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""X-ray Science Division, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, 60439, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tao Sun"", "",\u00a0Zhang Jiang"", "",\u00a0Joseph Strzalka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jin Wang""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Nanoscale Materials, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, 60439, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Leonidas Ocola""]}]",False,"[""Tao Sun"", ""Zhang Jiang"", ""Joseph Strzalka"", ""Leonidas Ocola"", ""Jin Wang""]","Sun, T., Jiang, Z., Strzalka, J. et al.

letter,Enhanced power-conversion efficiency in polymer solar cells using an inverted device structure,"<p>Polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells (PSCs) are currently attracting a great deal of attention and gaining increasing importance, having already shown great promise as renewable, lightweight and low-cost energy sources. Recently, the power-conversion efficiency of state-of-the-art PSCs has exceeded 8% in the scientific literature. However, to find viable applications for this emerging photovoltaic technology, further enhancements in the efficiency towards 10% (the threshold for commercial applications) are urgently required. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient PSCs with a certified efficiency of 9.2% using an inverted structure, which simultaneously offers ohmic contact for photogenerated charge-carrier collection and allows optimum photon harvest in the device. Because of the ease of use and drastic boost in efficiency provided by this device structure, this discovery could find use in fully exploiting the potential of various material systems, and also open up new opportunities to improve PSCs with a view to achieving an efficiency of 10%.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510640, PR China"", ""authors"": [""Zhicai He"", "",\u00a0Chengmei Zhong"", "",\u00a0Shijian Su"", "",\u00a0Miao Xu"", "",\u00a0Hongbin Wu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yong Cao""]}]",False,"[""Zhicai He"", ""Chengmei Zhong"", ""Shijian Su"", ""Miao Xu"", ""Hongbin Wu"", ""Yong Cao""]","He, Z., Zhong, C., Su, S. et al.

letter,Observation of one-way Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen steering,"<p>The distinctive non-classical features of quantum physics were first discussed in the seminal paper by A. Einstein, B. Podolsky and N. Rosen (EPR) in 1935. In his immediate response, E. Schr&#246;dinger introduced the notion of entanglement, now seen as the essential resource in quantum information as well as in quantum metrology. Furthermore, he showed that at the core of the EPR argument is a phenomenon that he called steering. In contrast to entanglement and violations of Bell's inequalities, steering implies a direction between the parties involved. Recent theoretical works have precisely defined this property, but the question arose as to whether there are bipartite states showing steering only in one direction. Here, we present an experimental realization of two entangled Gaussian modes of light that in fact shows the steering effect in one direction but not in the other. The generated one-way steering gives a new insight into quantum physics and may open a new field of applications in quantum information.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre for Quantum Engineering and Space-Time Research\u2014QUEST, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Welfengarten 1, Hannover, 30167, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Vitus H\u00e4ndchen"", "",\u00a0Tobias Eberle"", "",\u00a0Sebastian Steinlechner"", "",\u00a0Aiko Samblowski"", "",\u00a0Torsten Franz"", "",\u00a0Reinhard F.

letter,Realization of quantum Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment,"<p>Light is believed to exhibit wave&#8211;particle duality depending on the detecting devices, according to Bohr's complementarity principle, as has been demonstrated by the &#8216;delayed-choice experiment&#8217; with classical detecting devices. A recent proposal suggests that the detecting device can also occupy a quantum state, and a quantum version of the delayed-choice experiment can be performed. Here, we experimentally realize the quantum delayed-choice experiment and observe the wave&#8211;particle morphing phenomenon of a single photon. We also illustrate, for the first time, the behaviour of the quantum wave&#8211;particle superposition state of a single photon. We find that the quantum wave&#8211;particle superposition state is distinct from the classical mixture state because of quantum interference between the wave and particle states. Our work reveals the deep relationship between the complementarity principle and the superposition principle, and it may be helpful in furthering understanding of the behaviour of light.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, CAS, Hefei, 230026, China"", ""authors"": [""Jian-Shun Tang"", "",\u00a0Yu-Long Li"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Ye Xu"", "",\u00a0Guo-Yong Xiang"", "",\u00a0Chuan-Feng Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Guang-Can Guo""]}]",False,"[""Jian-Shun Tang"", ""Yu-Long Li"", ""Xiao-Ye Xu"", ""Guo-Yong Xiang"", ""Chuan-Feng Li"", ""Guang-Can Guo""]","Tang, J., Li, Y., Xu, X. et al.

letter,Ultrafast all-optical switching by single photons,"<p>An as yet outstanding goal in quantum optics is the realization of fast optical nonlinearities at the single-photon level. This would allow for the implementation of optical devices with new functionalities such as single-photon switches/transistors or controlled-phase gates. Although nonlinear optics effects at the single-emitter level have been demonstrated in a number of systems, none of these experiments showed single-photon switching on ultrafast timescales. Here, we perform pulsed two-colour spectroscopy and demonstrate that, in a strongly coupled quantum dot&#8211;cavity system, the presence of a single photon on one of the fundamental polariton transitions can turn on light scattering on a transition from the first to the second Jaynes&#8211;Cummings manifold. The overall switching time of this single-photon all-optical switch is &#8764;50 ps. In addition, we use the single-photon nonlinearity to implement a pulse correlator.

letter,Wafer-scale integration of group III–V lasers on silicon using transfer printing of epitaxial layers,"<p>The hard-drive and electronic industries can benefit by using the properties of light for power transfer and signalling. However, the integration of silicon electronics with lasers remains a challenge, because practical monolithic silicon lasers are not currently available. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for this integration, using an elastomeric stamp to selectively release and transfer epitaxial coupons of GaAs to realize III&#8211;V lasers on a silicon substrate by means of a wafer-scale printing process. Low-threshold continuous-wave lasing at a wavelength of 824&#160;nm is achieved from Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot ridge waveguide lasers operating at temperatures up to 100&#160;&#176;C. Single and multi-transverse mode devices emit total optical powers of &gt;60&#160;mW and support modulation bandwidths of &gt;3&#160;GHz.

The hybrid approach, in which silicon is integrated with a III&#8211;V gain medium, is an attractive route in the development of silicon lasers because of its potential for high efficiency. Hybrid lasers with good performance have been reported that are fabricated by direct growth or direct wafer-bonding of the gain medium to silicon. Here, we report a membrane reflector surface-emitting laser on silicon that is based on multilayer semiconductor nanomembrane stacking and a stamp-assisted transfer-printing process. The optically pumped laser consists of a transferred III&#8211;V InGaAsP quantum-well heterostructure as the gain medium, which is sandwiched between two thin, single-layer silicon photonic-crystal Fano resonance membrane reflectors. We also demonstrate high-finesse single- or multiwavelength vertical laser cavities.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, NanoFAB Center, University of Texas at Arlington, 76019, Texas, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hongjun Yang"", "",\u00a0Deyin Zhao"", "",\u00a0Santhad Chuwongin"", "",\u00a0Weiquan Yang"", "",\u00a0Yichen Shuai"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Weidong Zhou""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin, 53706, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jung-Hun Seo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zhenqiang Ma""]}, {""address"": ""Semerane, Inc, 202 East Border Street, Suite 149, Arlington, 76010, Texas, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hongjun Yang""]}, {""address"": ""KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, School of Information and Communication Technology, Electrum 229, Kista, 164 40, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Jesper Berggren"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mattias Hammar""]}]",False,"[""Hongjun Yang"", ""Deyin Zhao"", ""Santhad Chuwongin"", ""Jung-Hun Seo"", ""Weiquan Yang"", ""Yichen Shuai"", ""Jesper Berggren"", ""Mattias Hammar"", ""Zhenqiang Ma"", ""Weidong Zhou""]","Yang, H., Zhao, D., Chuwongin, S. et al.

article,FRET-assisted laser emission in colloidal suspensions of dye-doped latex nanoparticles,"<p>The use of commercial long-wavelength (&gt;650&#160;nm) laser dyes in many biophotonic applications has several important limitations, including low absorption at the standard pump wavelength (532&#160;nm) and poor photostability. Here, we demonstrate that the use of F&#246;rster type (FRET) energy transfer can overcome these problems to enable efficient, stable near-infrared lasing in a colloidal suspension of latex nanoparticles containing a mixture of Rhodamine 6G and Nile Blue dyes. Experimental and theoretical analyses of the photophysics suggest that the dominant energy transfer mechanism is F&#246;rster type via dipole&#8211;dipole coupling, and also reveal an unexpected core/shell morphology in the dye-doped nanoparticles. FRET-assisted incoherent random lasing is also demonstrated in solid samples obtained by evaporation of colloidal suspensions.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Instituto de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica \u2018Rocasolano\u2019, CSIC-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Serrano 119, Madrid, 28006, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Luis Cerd\u00e1n"", "",\u00a0Virginia Mart\u00edn"", "",\u00a0Angel Costela"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Inmaculada Garc\u00eda-Moreno""]}, {""address"": ""Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Av.

article,Sapphire-derived all-glass optical fibres,"<p>As performance demands continue to grow, many optical fibre systems are operating at progressively higher power levels. However, Brillouin scattering restricts continued power scaling in narrow-linewidth systems. Optical fibres with engineered Brillouin properties that are manufactured using industry-accepted methods would be of great practical benefit. Here, we show all-glass optical fibres derived from sapphire that have alumina concentrations of up to &#8764;55 mol%, which is considerably greater than conventionally possible and enables a series of useful properties. Specifically, a Brillouin gain coefficient of 3.1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;13</sup>&#160;m&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, a value nearly 100 times lower than commercial fibre, was measured for a fibre with an average alumina concentration of 54 mol%. Furthermore, a fibre with &#8764;38 mol% alumina was found to be athermal, with a Brillouin frequency that was insensitive to changes in temperature. Such optical fibres may be beneficial in realizing enhanced telecommunication, sensor and high-energy laser systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, 61801, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""P.
