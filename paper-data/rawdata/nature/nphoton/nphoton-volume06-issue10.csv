letter,Manipulation of cellular light from green fluorescent protein by a femtosecond laser,"<p>Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is one of the most widely studied and exploited proteins in biochemistry and cell biology. It emits fluorescence following optical excitation, which is usually provided by a laser. Here, we report that fluorescence from enhanced GFP can be &#8216;turned off&#8217; by exposing cells to laser light. A short flash of femtosecond laser light is shown to deplete calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. Calcium-release-activated calcium channels are then activated by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). The rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> depolarizes mitochondria and increases the leakage of reactive oxygen species, which then permanently bleach the GFP. This controllable optical scheme for reactive oxygen species generation can also be used to modulate the photoconversion of GFP fluorescence from green to red emission and provide a mechanism for influencing cellular molecular dynamics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ultrafast Laser Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Information Technology (Ministry of Education), College of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, PR China"", ""authors"": [""Hao He"", "",\u00a0Shaoyang Wang"", "",\u00a0Minglie Hu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Chingyue Wang""]}, {""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, PR China"", ""authors"": [""Shiyang Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Youjia Cao""]}]",False,"[""Hao He"", ""Shiyang Li"", ""Shaoyang Wang"", ""Minglie Hu"", ""Youjia Cao"", ""Chingyue Wang""]","He, H., Li, S., Wang, S. et al.

letter,Fluorescence imaging beyond the ballistic regime by ultrasound-pulse-guided digital phase conjugation,"<p>Fluorescence imaging has revolutionized biomedical research over the past three decades. Its high molecular specificity and unrivalled single-molecule-level sensitivity have enabled breakthroughs in a number of research fields. For in vivo applications its major limitation is its superficial imaging depth, a result of random scattering in biological tissues causing exponential attenuation of the ballistic component of a light wave. Here, we present fluorescence imaging beyond the ballistic regime by combining single-cycle pulsed ultrasound modulation and digital optical phase conjugation. We demonstrate a near-isotropic three-dimensional localized sound&#8211;light interaction zone. With the exceptionally high optical gain provided by the digital optical phase conjugation system, we can deliver sufficient optical power to a focus inside highly scattering media for not only fluorescence imaging but also a variety of linear and nonlinear spectroscopy measurements. This technology paves the way for many important applications in both fundamental biology research and clinical studies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Farm Research Campus, 19700 Helix Drive, Ashburn, 20147, Virginia, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ke Si"", "",\u00a0Reto Fiolka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Meng Cui""]}]",False,"[""Ke Si"", ""Reto Fiolka"", ""Meng Cui""]","Si, K., Fiolka, R. & Cui, M.

letter,Directional control of spin-wave emission by spatially shaped light,"<p>In future spintronics it is anticipated that spin waves will function as unique information carriers that are free from Joule heating. Directional control of spin-wave emission has been desired for the realization of switching devices. Here, we propose a promising technique that makes use of a spatially shaped light pulse with circular polarization. Focusing this light pulse on a magnet generates spin waves via the inverse Faraday effect. Moreover, the wavenumber distribution of the spin waves is determined by the spatial intensity distribution of the light spot. We demonstrate the principle of this technique both theoretically and experimentally. We successfully control the direction of the energy flow by shaping the light spot into an ellipse, with its major axis parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field. Our findings will open up the possibility of fast and arbitrary synthesis of spin-wave patterns by using a more sophisticated light-shaping technique, for example using a computer-generated hologram.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 153-8505, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takuya Satoh"", "",\u00a0Yuki Terui"", "",\u00a0Rai Moriya"", "",\u00a0Boris A.

letter,Bridging the mid-infrared-to-telecom gap with silicon nanophotonic spectral translation,"<p>Extending beyond traditional telecom-band applications to optical interconnects, the silicon nanophotonic integrated circuit platform also has notable advantages for use in high-performance mid-infrared optical systems operating in the 2&#8211;8&#160;&#181;m spectral range. Such systems could find applications in industrial and environmental monitoring, threat detection, medical diagnostics and free-space communication. Nevertheless, the advancement of chip-scale systems is impeded by the narrow-bandgap semiconductors traditionally used to detect mid-infrared photons. The cryogenic or multistage thermo-electric cooling required to suppress dark-current noise, which is exponentially dependent on E<sub>g</sub>/kT, can restrict the development of compact, low-power integrated mid-infrared systems. However, if the mid-infrared signals were spectrally translated to shorter wavelengths, wide-bandgap photodetectors could be used to eliminate prohibitive cooling requirements. Furthermore, such detectors typically have larger detectivity and bandwidth than their mid-infrared counterparts. Here, we use efficient four-wave mixing in silicon nanophotonic wires to facilitate spectral translation of a signal at 2,440&#160;nm to the telecom band at 1,620&#160;nm, across a span of 62&#160;THz.

article,Carrier multiplication between interacting nanocrystals for fostering silicon-based photovoltaics,"<p>The conversion of solar radiation into electric current with high efficiency is one of the most important topics of modern scientific research, as it holds great potential as a source of clean and renewable energy. Exploitation of interaction between nanocrystals seems to be a promising route to the establishment of third-generation photovoltaics. Here, we adopt a fully ab initio scheme to estimate the role of nanoparticle interplay in the carrier multiplication dynamics of interacting silicon nanocrystals. Energy and charge transfer-based carrier multiplication events are studied as a function of nanocrystal separation, demonstrating the benefits induced by the wavefunction sharing regime. We prove the relevance of these recombinative mechanisms for photovoltaic applications in the case of silicon nanocrystals arranged in dense arrays, quantifying at an atomic scale which conditions maximize the outcome.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, via Campi 213/A, Modena, 41125, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Marco Govoni""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Science and Methods for Engineering (DISMI), via Amendola 2 Pad.

article,Object-adapted optical trapping and shape-tracking of energy-switching helical bacteria,"<p>Optical tweezers are a flexible manipulation tool used to grab micro-objects at a specific point, but a controlled manipulation of objects with more complex or changing shapes is hardly possible. Here, we demonstrate, by time-sharing optical forces, that it is possible to adapt the shape of the trapping potential to the shape of an elongated helical bacterium. In contrast to most other trapped objects, this structure can continuously change its helical shape (and therefore its mechanical energy), making trapping it much more difficult than trapping tiny non-living objects. The shape deformations of the only 200-nm-thin bacterium (Spiroplasma) are measured space-resolved at 800&#160;Hz by exploiting local phase differences in coherently scattered trapping light. By localizing each slope of the bacterium we generate high-contrast, super-resolution movies in three dimensions, without any object staining.

article,A sub-40-mHz-linewidth laser based on a silicon single-crystal optical cavity,"<p>State-of-the-art laser frequency stabilization by high-finesse optical cavities is limited fundamentally by thermal noise-induced cavity length fluctuations. We present a novel design to reduce this thermal noise limit by an order of magnitude as well as an experimental realization of this new cavity system, demonstrating the most stable oscillator of any kind to date for averaging times of 0.1&#8211;10&#160;s. The cavity spacer and the mirror substrates are both constructed from single-crystal silicon and are operated at 124&#160;K, where the silicon thermal expansion coefficient is zero and the mechanical loss is small. The cavity is supported in a vibration-insensitive configuration, which, together with the superior stiffness of the silicon crystal, reduces the vibration-related noise. With rigorous analysis of heterodyne beat signals among three independent stable lasers, the silicon system demonstrates a fractional frequency instability of 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup> at short timescales and supports a laser linewidth of &lt;40&#160;mHz at 1.5&#160;&#181;m.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Bundesallee 100, Braunschweig, 38116, Germany"", ""authors"": [""T.

article,Demonstration of self-seeding in a hard-X-ray free-electron laser,"<p>The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is an X-ray free-electron laser at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, which has been operating since 2009 for a wide range of scientific research. The free-electron laser process at LCLS is based on self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) where spontaneous emission from the initial electron beam shot noise is amplified by its interaction with the electrons over a long magnetic undulator. Although SASE is very effective, producing tremendously powerful, ultrashort X-ray beams, the start-up from noise leaves poor temporal coherence and a broad, noisy spectrum. We present experimental results of a new method, suggested by colleagues at DESY, allowing self-seeding using X-rays from the first half of the undulator to seed the second half through a diamond-based monochromator, producing near Fourier-transform-limited X-ray pulses with 0.4&#8211;0.5&#160;eV bandwidth at 8&#8211;9&#160;keV. These results demonstrate self-seeding at &#229;ngstrom wavelengths with a relative bandwidth reduction of 40&#8211;50 with respect to SASE.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford, 94309, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""J.

article,Highly coherent and stable pulses from the FERMI seeded free-electron laser in the extreme ultraviolet,"<p>Free-electron lasers (FELs) are promising devices for generating light with laser-like properties in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray spectral regions. Recently, FELs based on the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) mechanism have allowed major breakthroughs in diffraction and spectroscopy applications, despite the relatively large shot-to-shot intensity and photon-energy fluctuations and the limited longitudinal coherence inherent in the SASE mechanism. Here, we report results on the initial performance of the FERMI seeded FEL, based on the high-gain harmonic generation configuration, in which an external laser is used to initiate the emission process. Emission from the FERMI FEL-1 source occurs in the form of pulses carrying energy of several tens of microjoules per pulse and tunable throughout the 65 to 20&#160;nm wavelength range, with unprecedented shot-to-shot wavelength stability, low-intensity fluctuations, close to transform-limited bandwidth, transverse and longitudinal coherence and full control of polarization.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A. di interesse nazionale, Strada Statale 14-km 163,5 in AREA Science Park, Basovizza, 34149, Trieste, Italy"", ""authors"": [""E.
