review article,Ultrafast acousto-magneto-plasmonics,"<p>Surface plasmon&#8211;polaritons are electromagnetic waves that propagate along metal&#8211;dielectric interfaces and exist over a wide range of frequencies. They have become popular research tools owing to their subwavelength confinement and potential ability to perform ultrasensitive optical measurements. Driven by tremendous progress in nanofabrication techniques and ultrafast laser technologies, the applications of surface plasmon&#8211;polariton nano-optics extend beyond nanoplasmonics. In this Review, we discuss how the use of hybrid multilayer structures combining different functionalities allows the development of active plasmonic devices and new metrologies. Magneto-plasmonics, acousto-plasmonics and the generation of high-energy photoelectrons using ultrashort surface plasmon&#8211;polariton pulses are all examples of how the combination of ideas developed in these individual fields can be used to generate new knowledge, leading to a range of exciting applications in nanophotonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut des Mol\u00e9cules et Mat\u00e9riaux du Mans, UMR CNRS 6283, Universit\u00e9 du Maine, Le Mans cedex, 72085, France"", ""authors"": [""Vasily V.

review article,Nonlinear plasmonics,"<p>When light interacts with metal nanostructures, it can couple to free-electron excitations near the metal surface. The electromagnetic resonances associated with these surface plasmons depend on the details of the nanostructure, opening up opportunities for controlling light confinement on the nanoscale. The resulting strong electromagnetic fields allow weak nonlinear processes, which depend superlinearly on the local field, to be significantly enhanced. In addition to providing enhanced nonlinear effects with ultrafast response times, plasmonic nanostructures allow nonlinear optical components to be scaled down in size.

letter,Non-polarizing broadband multilayer reflectors in fish,"<p>Dielectric multilayer reflectors that are non-polarizing are an important class of optical device and have numerous applications within optical fibres, dielectric waveguides and light-emitting diodes. Here, we report analyses of a biological non-polarizing optical mechanism found in the broadband guanine-cytoplasm &#8216;silver&#8217; multilayer reflectors of three species of fish. Present in the fish stratum argenteum are two populations of birefringent guanine crystal, with their optical axes either parallel to the long axis of the crystal or perpendicular to the plane of the crystal, respectively. This arrangement neutralizes the polarization of reflection as a result of the different interfacial Brewster's angles of each population. The fish reflective mechanism is distinct from existing non-polarizing mirror designs in that, importantly, there is no refractive index contrast between the low-index layers in the reflector and the external environment. This mechanism could be readily manufactured and exploited in synthetic optical devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Biological Sciences, Woodland Road, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS8 1UG, UK"", ""authors"": [""T.

letter,A proposal for multi-tens of GW fully coherent femtosecond soft X-ray lasers,"<p>X-ray free-electron lasers delivering up to 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>13</sup> coherent photons in femtosecond pulses are bringing about a revolution in X-ray science. However, some plasma-based soft X-ray lasers are attractive because they spontaneously emit an even higher number of photons (1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>15</sup>), but these are emitted in incoherent and long (hundreds of picoseconds) pulses as a consequence of the amplification of stochastic incoherent self-emission. Previous experimental attempts to seed such amplifiers with coherent femtosecond soft X-rays resulted in as yet unexplained weak amplification of the seed and strong amplification of incoherent spontaneous emission. Using a time-dependent Maxwell&#8211;Bloch model describing the amplification of both coherent and incoherent soft X-rays in plasma, we explain the observed inefficiency and propose a new amplification scheme based on the seeding of stretched high harmonics using a transposition of chirped pulse amplification to soft X-rays. This scheme is able to deliver 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>14</sup> fully coherent soft X-ray photons in 200&#160;fs pulses and with a peak power of 20&#160;GW.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""LOA, UMR 7639, ENSTA-ParisTech, CNRS, Ecole Polytechnique-ParisTech, Chemin de la Huni\u00e8re, Palaiseau, F-91761, France"", ""authors"": [""E.

letter,A high-resolution microchip optomechanical accelerometer,"<p>The monitoring of acceleration is essential for a variety of applications ranging from inertial navigation to consumer electronics. Typical accelerometer operation involves the sensitive displacement measurement of a flexibly mounted test mass, which can be realized using capacitive, piezo-electric, tunnel-current or optical methods. Although optical detection provides superior displacement resolution, resilience to electromagnetic interference and long-range readout, current optical accelerometers either do not allow for chip-scale integration or utilize relatively bulky test mass sensors of low bandwidth. Here, we demonstrate an optomechanical accelerometer that makes use of ultrasensitive displacement readout using a photonic-crystal nanocavity monolithically integrated with a nanotethered test mass of high mechanical Q-factor. This device achieves an acceleration resolution of 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> with submilliwatt optical power, bandwidth greater than 20&#160;kHz and a dynamic range of greater than 40&#160;dB.

letter,Experimental realization of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm using qubit recycling,"<p>Quantum computational algorithms exploit quantum mechanics to solve problems exponentially faster than the best classical algorithms. Shor's quantum algorithm for fast number factoring is a key example and the prime motivator in the international effort to realize a quantum computer. However, due to the substantial resource requirement, to date there have been only four small-scale demonstrations. Here, we address this resource demand and demonstrate a scalable version of Shor's algorithm in which the n-qubit control register is replaced by a single qubit that is recycled n times: the total number of qubits is one-third of that required in the standard protocol. Encoding the work register in higher-dimensional states, we implement a two-photon compiled algorithm to factor N&#160;=&#160;21. The algorithmic output is distinguishable from noise, in contrast to previous demonstrations. These results point to larger-scale implementations of Shor's algorithm by harnessing scalable resource reductions applicable to all physical architectures.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""H. H.

The performance of these links is limited by the classical signalling time between such locations, necessitating the need for long-lived quantum memories. Here, we present the design of a communications network that neither requires the establishment of entanglement between remote locations nor the use of long-lived quantum memories. The rate at which quantum data can be transmitted along the network is only limited by the time required to perform efficient local gate operations. Our scheme therefore has the potential to provide higher communications rates than previously thought possible.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1 Morinosato-Wakamiya, Atsugi, 243-0198, Kanagawa, Japan"", ""authors"": [""W.

article,Realizing effective magnetic field for photons by controlling the phase of dynamic modulation,"<p>The goal to achieve arbitrary control of photon flow has motivated much of the recent research on photonic crystals and metamaterials. As a new mechanism for controlling photon flow, we introduce a scheme that generates an effective magnetic field for photons. We consider a resonator lattice in which the coupling constants between the resonators are harmonically modulated in time. With appropriate choice of the spatial distribution of the modulation phases, an effective magnetic field for photons can be created, leading to a Lorentz force for photons and the emergence of topologically protected one-way photon edge states that are robust against disorders&#8212;without the use of magneto-optical effects.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kejie Fang""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Zongfu Yu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shanhui Fan""]}]",False,"[""Kejie Fang"", ""Zongfu Yu"", ""Shanhui Fan""]","Fang, K., Yu, Z. & Fan, S.

article,Room-temperature mid-infrared single-photon spectral imaging,"<p>The spectral imaging and detection of mid-infrared wavelengths is emerging as an enabling technology of great technical and scientific interest, primarily because important chemical compounds display unique and strong mid-infrared spectral fingerprints that reveal valuable chemical information. Modern quantum cascade lasers have evolved as ideal coherent mid-infrared excitation sources, but simple, low-noise, room-temperature detectors and imaging systems lag behind. We address this need by presenting a novel, field-deployable, upconversion system for sensitive, two-dimensional, mid-infrared spectral imaging. A room-temperature dark noise of 0.2 photons/spatial element/second is measured, which is a billion times below the dark noise level of cryogenically cooled InSb cameras. Single-photon imaging and a resolution of up to 200 &#215; 100 spatial elements are obtained with a record-high continuous-wave quantum efficiency of &#8764;20% for polarized incoherent light at 3 &#181;m. The proposed method is relevant for existing and new mid-infrared applications such as gas analysis and medical diagnostics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Roskilde, DK-4000, Denmark"", ""authors"": [""Jeppe Seidelin Dam"", "",\u00a0Peter Tidemand-Lichtenberg"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christian Pedersen""]}]",False,"[""Jeppe Seidelin Dam"", ""Peter Tidemand-Lichtenberg"", ""Christian Pedersen""]","Dam, J., Tidemand-Lichtenberg, P. & Pedersen, C.
