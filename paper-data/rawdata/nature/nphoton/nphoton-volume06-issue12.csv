letter,Silk inverse opals,"<p>Periodic nanostructures provide the facility to control and manipulate the flow of light through their lattices. Three-dimensional photonic crystals enable the controlled design of structural colour, which can be varied by infiltrating the structure with different (typically liquid) fillers. Here, we report three-dimensional photonic crystals composed entirely of a purified natural protein (silk fibroin). The biocompatibility of this protein, as well as its favourable material properties and ease of biological functionalization, present opportunities for otherwise unattainable device applications such as bioresorbable integration of structural colour within living tissue or lattice functionalization by means of organic and inorganic material doping. We present a silk inverse opal that demonstrates a pseudo-photonic bandgap in the visible spectrum and show its associated structural colour beneath biological tissue. We also leverage silk's facile dopability to manufacture a gold nanoparticle silk inverse opal and demonstrate patterned heating mediated by enhancement of nanoparticle absorption at the band-edge frequency of the photonic crystal.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tufts University, 4 Colby Street, Medford, 02155, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Sunghwan Kim"", "",\u00a0Alexander N.

letter,Highly efficient water splitting by a dual-absorber tandem cell,"<p>Photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices, which use solar energy to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen, have been investigated for decades. Multijunction designs are most efficient, as they can absorb enough solar energy and provide sufficient free energy for water cleavage. However, a balance exists between device complexity, cost and efficiency. Water splitters fabricated using triple-junction amorphous silicon or III&#8211;V semiconductors have demonstrated reasonable efficiencies, but at high cost and high device complexity. Simpler approaches using oxide-based semiconductors in a dual-absorber tandem approach have reported solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies only up to 0.3% (ref.&#160;). Here, we present a device based on an oxide photoanode and a dye-sensitized solar cell, which performs unassisted water splitting with an efficiency of up to 3.1% STH. The design relies on carefully selected redox mediators for the dye-sensitized solar cell and surface passivation techniques and catalysts for the oxide-based photoanodes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Station 6, 1015-Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Jeremie Brillet"", "",\u00a0Jun-Ho Yum"", "",\u00a0Maurin Cornuz"", "",\u00a0Takashi Hisatomi"", "",\u00a0Michael Graetzel"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kevin Sivula""]}, {""address"": ""Centre for New Technologies and Department of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, 02-093, Poland"", ""authors"": [""Renata Solarska"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jan Augustynski""]}]",False,"[""Jeremie Brillet"", ""Jun-Ho Yum"", ""Maurin Cornuz"", ""Takashi Hisatomi"", ""Renata Solarska"", ""Jan Augustynski"", ""Michael Graetzel"", ""Kevin Sivula""]","Brillet, J., Yum, J., Cornuz, M. et al.

letter,Attosecond lighthouses from plasma mirrors,"<p>The nonlinear interaction of an intense femtosecond laser pulse with matter can lead to the emission of a train of sub-laser-cycle&#8212;attosecond&#8212;bursts of short-wavelength radiation. Much effort has been devoted to producing isolated attosecond pulses, as these are better suited to real-time imaging of fundamental electronic processes. Successful methods developed so far rely on confining the nonlinear interaction to a single sub-cycle event. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a simpler and more universal approach to this problem, applied to nonlinear laser&#8211;plasma interactions. By rotating the instantaneous wavefront direction of an intense few-cycle laser field as it interacts with a solid-density plasma, we separate the nonlinearly generated attosecond pulse train into multiple beams of isolated attosecond pulses propagating in different and controlled directions away from the plasma surface. This unique method produces a manifold of isolated attosecond pulses, ideally synchronized for initiating and probing ultrafast electron motion in matter.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire d'Optique Appliqu\u00e9e, ENSTA-Paristech, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, CNRS, Palaiseau, 91761, France"", ""authors"": [""Jonathan A.

letter,Superdiffusion in optically controlled active media,"<p>Active media are complex systems driven by both thermal fluctuations and additional energy sources and are encountered in a variety of phenomena including mobile bacteria, protein diffusion or turbulent flows. However, studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of active media is often difficult because of their size and complexity. Here, we demonstrate that an active medium can be realized and controlled optically through dynamic coupling between multiply scattered light and colloidal particles. As a result of a strong light&#8211;matter interaction, the particles undergo diffusion upon a spatiotemporal random potential that leads to an apparent superdiffusion over timescales controlled by, among other things, both the input power and particle size.

article,Nanofocusing in a metal–insulator–metal gap plasmon waveguide with a three-dimensional linear taper,"<p>The development of techniques for efficiently confining photons on the deep sub-wavelength spatial scale will revolutionize scientific research and engineering practices. The efficient coupling of light into extremely small nanofocusing devices has been a major challenge in on-chip nanophotonics because of the need to overcome various loss mechanisms and the on-chip nanofabrication challenges. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the achievement of highly efficient nanofocusing in an Au&#8211;SiO<sub>2</sub>&#8211;Au gap plasmon waveguide using a carefully engineered three-dimensional taper. The dimensions of the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer, perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, taper linearly below 100&#160;nm. Our simulations suggest that the three-dimensional linear-tapering approach could focus 830&#160;nm light into a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;5&#160;nm<sup>2</sup> area with &#8804;3&#160;dB loss and an intensity enhancement of 3.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>4</sup>.

article,High-speed molecular spectral imaging of tissue with stimulated Raman scattering,"<p>To date, medical imaging of tissues has largely relied on time-consuming staining processes, and there is a need for rapid, label-free imaging techniques. Stimulated Raman scattering microscopy offers a three-dimensional, real-time imaging capability with chemical specificity. However, it can be difficult to differentiate between several constituents in tissues because their spectral characteristics can overlap. Furthermore, imaging speeds in previous multispectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging techniques were limited. Here, we demonstrate label-free imaging of tissues by 30&#160;frames/s stimulated Raman scattering microscopy with frame-by-frame wavelength tunability. To produce multicolour images showing different constituents, spectral images were processed by modified independent component analysis, which can extract small differences in spectral features. We present various imaging modalities such as two-dimensional spectral imaging of rat liver, two-colour three-dimensional imaging of a vessel in rat liver, spectral imaging of several sections of intestinal villi in mouse, and in vivo spectral imaging of mouse ear skin.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Advanced Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, 565-0871, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yasuyuki Ozeki"", "",\u00a0Wataru Umemura"", "",\u00a0Kazuhiko Sumimura"", "",\u00a0Kiichi Fukui"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kazuyoshi Itoh""]}, {""address"": ""Japan Science and Technology Agency, PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, 332-0012, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yasuyuki Ozeki""]}, {""address"": ""Canon Inc., Frontier Research Center, 30-2 Shimomaruko 3-chome, Ota-ku, 146-8501, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yoichi Otsuka"", "",\u00a0Shuya Satoh"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hiroyuki Hashimoto""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8603, Aichi, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Norihiko Nishizawa""]}]",False,"[""Yasuyuki Ozeki"", ""Wataru Umemura"", ""Yoichi Otsuka"", ""Shuya Satoh"", ""Hiroyuki Hashimoto"", ""Kazuhiko Sumimura"", ""Norihiko Nishizawa"", ""Kiichi Fukui"", ""Kazuyoshi Itoh""]","Ozeki, Y., Umemura, W., Otsuka, Y. et al.

article,Ultrafast X-ray pulse characterization at free-electron lasers,"<p>The ability to fully characterize ultrashort, ultra-intense X-ray pulses at free-electron lasers (FELs) will be crucial in experiments ranging from single-molecule imaging to extreme-timescale X-ray science. This issue is especially important at current-generation FELs, which are primarily based on self-amplified spontaneous emission and radiate with parameters that fluctuate strongly from pulse to pulse. Using single-cycle terahertz pulses from an optical laser, we have extended the streaking techniques of attosecond metrology to measure the temporal profile of individual FEL pulses with 5&#160;fs full-width at half-maximum accuracy, as well as their arrival on a time base synchronized to the external laser to within 6&#160;fs r.m.s.

article,Ultra-efficient ionization of heavy atoms by intense X-ray free-electron laser pulses,"<p>X-ray free-electron lasers provide unique opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamics and for imaging the structures of complex systems. Understanding the response of individual atoms to intense X-rays is essential for most free-electron laser applications. First experiments have shown that, for light atoms, the dominant interaction mechanism is ionization by sequential electron ejection, where the highest charge state produced is defined by the last ionic state that can be ionized with one photon. Here, we report an unprecedentedly high degree of ionization of xenon atoms by 1.5&#160;keV free-electron laser pulses to charge states with ionization energies far exceeding the photon energy. Comparing ion charge-state distributions and fluorescence spectra with state-of-the-art calculations, we find that these surprisingly high charge states are created via excitation of transient resonances in highly charged ions, and predict resonance enhanced absorption to be a general phenomenon in the interaction of intense X-rays with systems containing high-Z constituents.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max Planck Advanced Study Group at Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Hamburg, 22607, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Benedikt Rudek"", "",\u00a0Lutz Foucar"", "",\u00a0Sascha W.

article,Strain-engineered artificial atom as a broad-spectrum solar energy funnel,"<p>An optoelectronic material with a spatially varying bandgap that is tunable is highly desirable for use in photovoltaics, photocatalysis and photodetection. Elastic strain has the potential to be used to achieve rapid and reversible tuning of the bandgap. However, as a result of plasticity or fracture, conventional materials cannot sustain a high enough elastic strain to create sufficient changes in their physical properties. Recently, an emergent class of materials&#8212;named &#8216;ultrastrength materials&#8217;&#8212;have been shown to avoid inelastic relaxation up to a significant fraction of their ideal strength. Here, we illustrate theoretically and computationally that elastic strain is a viable agent for creating a continuously varying bandgap profile in an initially homogeneous, atomically thin membrane. We propose that a photovoltaic device made from a strain-engineered MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer will capture a broad range of the solar spectrum and concentrate excitons or charge carriers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""International Center for Quantum Materials, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China"", ""authors"": [""Ji Feng""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiaofeng Qian"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Wei Huang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ju Li""]}, {""address"": ""State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials and Frontier Institute of Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China"", ""authors"": [""Ju Li""]}]",False,"[""Ji Feng"", ""Xiaofeng Qian"", ""Cheng-Wei Huang"", ""Ju Li""]","Feng, J., Qian, X., Huang, C. et al.
