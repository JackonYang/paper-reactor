letter,Entanglement-enhanced probing of a delicate material system,"<p>Quantum metrology uses entanglement and other quantum effects to improve the sensitivity of demanding measurements. Probing of delicate systems demands high sensitivity from limited probe energy and has motivated the field's key benchmark&#8212;the standard quantum limit. Here we report the first entanglement-enhanced measurement of a delicate material system. We non-destructively probe an atomic spin ensemble by means of near-resonant Faraday rotation, a measurement that is limited by probe-induced scattering in quantum-memory and spin-squeezing applications. We use narrowband, atom-resonant NOON states to beat the standard quantum limit of sensitivity by more than five standard deviations, both on a per-photon and per-damage basis. This demonstrates quantum enhancement with fully realistic loss and noise, including variable-loss effects. The experiment opens the way to ultra-gentle probing of single atoms, single molecules, quantum gases and living cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO \u2013 Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, Castelldefels (Barcelona), 08860, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Florian Wolfgramm"", "",\u00a0Federica A.

letter,Frequency-multiplexed in vivo multiphoton phosphorescence lifetime microscopy,"<p>Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is widely used in vivo for optical sectioning deep inside scattering tissue. Phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM) is a powerful technique for obtaining biologically relevant chemical information through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer and phosphorescence quenching. Point-measurement PLIM of phosphorescence quenching probes has recently provided oxygen partial pressure measurements in small rodent brain vasculature identified by high-resolution MPM. However, the maximum fluorescence generation rate, which is inversely proportional to the phosphorescence lifetime, fundamentally limits PLIM pixel rates. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a parallel-excitation/parallel-collection MPM&#8211;PLIM system that increases the pixel rate by a factor of 100 compared with conventional configurations, while simultaneously acquiring lifetime and intensity images at depth in vivo. Full-frame, three-dimensional, in vivo PLIM imaging of phosphorescent quenching dye is presented for the first time and defines a new platform for biological and medical imaging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, 212 Clark Hall, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Scott S.

letter,Spatial and spectral coherent control with frequency combs,"<p>Quantum coherent control is a powerful tool for steering the outcome of quantum processes towards a desired final state by the accurate manipulation of quantum interference between multiple pathways. Although coherent control techniques have found applications in many fields of science, the possibilities for spatial and high-resolution frequency control have remained limited. Here, we show that the use of counter-propagating broadband pulses enables the generation of fully controlled spatial excitation patterns. This spatial control approach also provides decoherence reduction, which allows the use of the high-frequency resolution of an optical frequency comb. We exploit the counter-propagating geometry to perform spatially selective excitation of individual species in a multicomponent gas mixture, as well as frequency determination of hyperfine constants of atomic rubidium with unprecedented accuracy.

letter,Focusing of X-ray free-electron laser pulses with reflective optics,"<p>X-ray free-electron lasers produce intense femtosecond pulses that have applications in exploring new frontiers in science. The unique characteristics of X-ray free-electron laser radiation can be enhanced significantly using focusing optics. However, with such an optical device, even a slight deviation from the ideal design can lead to considerable errors in the focusing properties.

letter,Direct determination of the transition to localization of light in three dimensions,"<p>Diffusive wave transport in three-dimensional media should show a phase transition, with increasing disorder, to a state without transport. This transition was first discussed by Anderson in the context of the metal&#8211;insulator transition, but is generic for all waves, as was realized later. However, the quest for the experimental demonstration of &#8216;Anderson&#8217; localization in three dimensions has been a challenging task. For electrons and cold atoms, the challenge lies in the possibility of bound states in a disordered potential. Therefore, electromagnetic and acoustic waves have been the prime candidates for the observation of Anderson localization. The main challenge in using light lies in the distinction between the effects of absorption and localization. Here, we present measurements of the time dependence of the transverse width of the transmitted-light intensity distribution, which provides a direct measure of the localization length, independent of absorption. This provides direct evidence for a localization transition in three dimensions.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Fachbereich Physik, University of Konstanz, Universit\u00e4tsstrasse 10, Konstanz, 78457, Germany"", ""authors"": [""T.

article,Photoconductivity of biased graphene,"<p>Graphene is a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors, terahertz imagers and plasmonic devices. The origin of the photoresponse in graphene junctions has been studied extensively and is attributed to either thermoelectric or photovoltaic effects. In addition, hot carrier transport and carrier multiplication are thought to play an important role. Here, we report the intrinsic photoresponse in biased but otherwise homogeneous graphene. In this classic photoconductivity experiment, the thermoelectric effects are insignificant. Instead, the photovoltaic and a photo-induced bolometric effect dominate the photoresponse. The measured photocurrent displays polarity reversal as it alternates between these two mechanisms in a backgate voltage sweep. Our analysis yields elevated electron and phonon temperatures, with the former an order higher than the latter, shedding light on the understanding of the hot electron-driven photoresponse in graphene and its energy loss pathway via phonons.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IBM Thomas J.

article,Deterministic polarization chaos from a laser diode,"<p>Fifty years after the invention of the laser diode, and forty years after the butterfly effect signified the unpredictability of deterministic chaos, it is commonly believed that a laser diode behaves like a damped nonlinear oscillator and cannot be driven into chaotic operation without additional forcing or parameter modulation. Here, we counter that belief and report the first example of a free-running laser diode generating chaos. The underlying physics comprises a nonlinear coupling between two elliptically polarized modes in a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser. We identify chaos in experimental time series and show, theoretically, the bifurcations leading to single- and double-scroll attractors with characteristics similar to Lorenz chaos. The reported polarization chaos resembles noise-driven mode hopping, but shows opposite statistical properties. Our findings open up new research areas for the creation of controllable and integrated sources of optical chaos.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Sup\u00e9lec OPTEL Research Group, Laboratoire Mat\u00e9riaux Optiques, Photonique et Syst\u00e8mes (LMOPS) EA-4423, 2 rue Edouard Belin, Metz, 57070, France"", ""authors"": [""Martin Virte"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Marc Sciamanna""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics and Photonics (B-PHOT TONA), Brussels Photonics Team, Vrije Universiteit Brussels, Pleinlaan 2, Brussels, 1050, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Martin Virte"", "",\u00a0Krassimir Panajotov"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hugo Thienpont""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Solid-State Physics, 72 Tzarigradsko Chaussee Boulevard, Sofia, 1784, Bulgaria"", ""authors"": [""Krassimir Panajotov""]}]",False,"[""Martin Virte"", ""Krassimir Panajotov"", ""Hugo Thienpont"", ""Marc Sciamanna""]","Virte, M., Panajotov, K., Thienpont, H. et al.

article,Suppression of interactions in multimode random lasers in the Anderson localized regime,"<p>Understanding random lasing is a formidable theoretical challenge. Unlike conventional lasers, random lasers have no resonator to trap light, they are highly multimode with potentially strong modal interactions, and they are based on disordered gain media, where photons undergo random multiple scattering. Interference effects notoriously modify the propagation of waves in such random media, but their fate in the presence of nonlinearity and interactions is poorly understood. Here, we present a semiclassical theory for multimode random lasing in the strongly scattering regime. We show that Anderson localization, a wave interference effect, is not affected by the presence of nonlinearities. To the contrary, its presence suppresses interactions between simultaneously lasing modes. Consequently, each lasing mode in a strongly scattering random laser is given by a single long-lived, Anderson localized mode of the passive cavity, the frequency and wave profile of which do not vary with pumping, even in the multimode regime when modes spatially overlap.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, 845 11, Slovakia"", ""authors"": [""Peter Stano""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 82, Basel, CH-4056, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Peter Stano""]}, {""address"": ""Physics Department, University of Arizona, 1118 E 4th Street, Tucson, 85721, Arizona, USA"", ""authors"": [""Philippe Jacquod""]}, {""address"": ""College of Optical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, 85721, Arizona, USA"", ""authors"": [""Philippe Jacquod""]}, {""address"": ""D\u00e9partment de Physique Th\u00e9orique, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, Gen\u00e8ve, CH-1211, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Philippe Jacquod""]}]",False,"[""Peter Stano"", ""Philippe Jacquod""]","Stano, P., Jacquod, P.

article,Bell's measure in classical optical coherence,"<p>The statistical description of optical fields in classical coherence theory is the foundation for many applications in metrology, microscopy, lithography and astronomy. Partial coherence is commonly attributed to underlying fluctuations originating at the source or arising upon passage through a random medium. A less acknowledged source of uncertainty (partial coherence) stems from the act of ignoring a degree of freedom of a beam when observing another degree of freedom coupled to (or classically entangled with) it. We demonstrate here that Bell's measure, which is commonly used in tests of quantum non-locality, may be used as a quantitative tool in classical optical coherence to delineate native incoherence associated with statistical fluctuations from correlation- (or, entanglement-) based incoherence. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the concepts recently developed in quantum information science to classical optical coherence theory and optical signal processing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CREOL, The College of Optics & Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32816, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kumel H.
