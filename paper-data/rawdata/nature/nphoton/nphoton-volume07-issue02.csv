letter,Marker-free phase nanoscopy,"<p>We introduce a microscopic method that determines quantitative optical properties beyond the optical diffraction limit and allows direct imaging of unstained living biological specimens. In established holographic microscopy, complex fields are measured using interferometric detection, allowing diffraction-limited phase measurements. Here, we show that non-invasive optical nanoscopy can achieve a lateral resolution of 90&#160;nm by using a quasi-2&#960;-holographic detection scheme and complex deconvolution. We record holograms from different illumination directions on the sample plane and observe subwavelength tomographic variations of the specimen. Nanoscale apertures serve to calibrate the tomographic reconstruction and to characterize the imaging system by means of the coherent transfer function. This gives rise to realistic inverse filtering and guarantees true complex field reconstruction. The observations are shown for nanoscopic porous cell frustule (diatoms), for the direct study of bacteria (Escherichia coli), and for a time-lapse approach to explore the dynamics of living dendritic spines (neurones).</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Advanced Photonics Laboratory, Microvision and Microdiagnostic Group (SCI STI CHD), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Yann Cotte"", "",\u00a0Fatih Toy"", "",\u00a0Nicolas Pavillon"", "",\u00a0Daniel Boss"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christian Depeursinge""]}, {""address"": ""Brain and Mind Institute, Laboratory of Neuroenergetics and Cellular Dynamics (LNDC), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Pascal Jourdain"", "",\u00a0Daniel Boss"", "",\u00a0Pierre Magistretti"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Pierre Marquet""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Psychiatry-University Hospital, Centre de Neurosciences Psychiatriques, Prilly-Lausanne, 1008, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Pierre Magistretti"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Pierre Marquet""]}]",False,"[""Yann Cotte"", ""Fatih Toy"", ""Pascal Jourdain"", ""Nicolas Pavillon"", ""Daniel Boss"", ""Pierre Magistretti"", ""Pierre Marquet"", ""Christian Depeursinge""]","Cotte, Y., Toy, F., Jourdain, P. et al.

letter,Radiofrequency signal-generation system with over seven octaves of continuous tuning,"<p>Spectrum congestion and demand for higher data rates are driving a push towards higher carrier frequencies in wireless communications, necessitating sources of exceptionally pure, widely tunable radiofrequency carrier signals. There is increasing interest in the exploration of ultrawide-bandwidth optoelectronic systems with a view to meeting this need. Here, we present an optoelectronic system based on sideband-injection-locked lasers for generating low-noise carriers, which is tunable over a frequency span of more than seven octaves. A nonlinear electronic element generates a broad comb of radiofrequency harmonics from a low-frequency reference oscillator, and a broadband optical modulator converts them into optical sidebands for injection seeding. Utilizing a reference tuned from 0.5 to 4&#160;GHz, continuously tunable signals from 0.5 to 110&#160;GHz are reported, which preserve the timing jitter of the reference. By using high-performance phase modulators and photodetectors, we believe that this system could be extended to operation at &gt;300&#160;GHz, and could be realized in a compact, integrated package.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Delaware, Newark, 19716, Delaware, USA"", ""authors"": [""Garrett J.

letter,"Experimental demonstration of optical transport, sorting and self-arrangement using a 'tractor beam'","<p>Following the Keplerian idea of optical forces, one would intuitively expect that an object illuminated by sunlight radiation or a laser beam will be accelerated along the direction of photon flow. Recent theoretical studies have shown that small particles can be pulled by light beams against the photon stream, even in beams with uniform optical intensity along the propagation axis. Here, we present a geometry to generate such a &#8216;tractor beam&#8217;, and experimentally demonstrate its functionality using spherical microparticles of various sizes, as well as its enhancement with optically self-arranged structures of microparticles. In addition to the pulling of the particles, we also demonstrate that their two-dimensional motion and one-dimensional sorting may be controlled conveniently by rotation of the polarization of the linearly polarized incident beam. The relative simplicity of this geometry could serve to encourage its widespread application, and ongoing investigations will broaden the understanding of the light&#8211;matter interaction through studies combining more interacting micro-objects with various properties.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Scientific Instruments of the ASCR, v.v.i, Kr\u00e1lovopolsk\u00e1 147, Brno, 612 64, Czech Republic"", ""authors"": [""O.

letter,Real-time observation of ultrafast Rabi oscillations between excitons and plasmons in metal nanostructures with J-aggregates,"<p>Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), optical excitations at the interface between a metal and a dielectric, carry significant potential for guiding and manipulating light on the nanoscale. However, their weak optical nonlinearities hinder active device fabrication, for example, for all-optical switching or information processing. Recently, strong optical dipole coupling has been demonstrated between SPPs and nonlinear quantum emitters with normal mode splittings of up to 700&#160;meV (refs&#160;&#8211;). The predicted ultrafast energy transfer between quantum emitters and SPP fields could be a crucial microscopic mechanism for switching light by light on the nanoscale. Here, we present the first real-time observation of ultrafast Rabi oscillations in a J-aggregate/metal nanostructure, indicating coherent energy transfer between excitonic quantum emitters and SPP fields. We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the coupling energy by controlling the exciton density on a 10&#160;fs timescale, which represents a step towards coherent, all-optical ultrafast plasmonic circuits and devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Physik and Center of Interface Science, Carl von Ossietzky Universit\u00e4t, Oldenburg, 26129, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Parinda Vasa"", "",\u00a0Wei Wang"", "",\u00a0Robert Pomraenke"", "",\u00a0Melanie Lammers"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christoph Lienau""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India"", ""authors"": [""Parinda Vasa""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, IFN-CNR, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, 20133, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Margherita Maiuri"", "",\u00a0Cristian Manzoni"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Giulio Cerullo""]}]",False,"[""Parinda Vasa"", ""Wei Wang"", ""Robert Pomraenke"", ""Melanie Lammers"", ""Margherita Maiuri"", ""Cristian Manzoni"", ""Giulio Cerullo"", ""Christoph Lienau""]","Vasa, P., Wang, W., Pomraenke, R. et al.

letter,Realization of three-dimensional guiding of photons in photonic crystals,"<p>Three-dimensional photonic crystals are expected to provide a fundamental building block for the realization of three-dimensional manipulation of photons. However, because of the lack of systematic design principles to precisely control bending and guiding in three dimensions, as well as advancements in the fabrication technology necessary for the realization of large-area, defect-free three-dimensional photonic crystals, the arbitrary three-dimensional manipulation of photons has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we develop a new design concept for three-dimensional waveguides and bends, and realize it experimentally in silicon three-dimensional photonic crystals. We demonstrate clear three-dimensional optical guiding phenomena, in which light is incident on the crystal from one side, is bent vertically and horizontally (and is even split into two or trapped by an intermediate nanocavity), and is finally emitted from the other side of the crystal. These results will open the door to the realization of three-dimensional optical chips with various functionalities.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kenji Ishizaki"", "",\u00a0Masaki Koumura"", "",\u00a0Katsuyoshi Suzuki"", "",\u00a0Kou Gondaira"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Susumu Noda""]}]",False,"[""Kenji Ishizaki"", ""Masaki Koumura"", ""Katsuyoshi Suzuki"", ""Kou Gondaira"", ""Susumu Noda""]","Ishizaki, K., Koumura, M., Suzuki, K. et al.

letter,Phase modulation at the few-photon level for weak-nonlinearity-based quantum computing,"<p>The ability of a few-photon light field to impart an appreciable phase shift on another light field is critical for many quantum information applications. A recently proposed paradigm for quantum computation utilizes weak nonlinearities, where a strong field mediates such cross-phase shifts between single photons. Such a protocol promises to be feasible in terms of scalability to many qubits if a cross-phase shift of 10<sup>&#8211;5</sup> to 10<sup>&#8211;2</sup> radians per photon can be achieved. A promising platform to achieve such cross-phase shifts is the hollow-core photonic bandgap fibre, which can highly confine atomic vapours and light over distances much greater than the diffraction length. Here, we produce large cross-phase shifts of 0.3&#160;mrad per photon with a fast response time (&lt;5&#160;ns) using rubidium atoms confined to a hollow-core photonic bandgap fibre, which represents, to our knowledge, the largest such nonlinear phase shift induced in a single pass through a room-temperature medium.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Vivek Venkataraman"", "",\u00a0Kasturi Saha"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Alexander L.

article,Limits on classical communication from quantum entropy power inequalities,"<p>Almost all modern communication systems rely on electromagnetic fields. The additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is often a good approximate description of such a system, and its information-carrying capacity is given by a simple formula. The quantum analogue of AWGN channels, the bosonic Gaussian noise channel, accurately describes many quantum optical communication systems of interest. Estimating its capacity is significantly more difficult; although some simple coding strategies are known, whether or not more sophisticated techniques could dramatically improve communication rates has been unknown. Here, we present strong new upper bounds for the classical capacity of bosonic Gaussian noise channels. These results imply that known coding techniques are typically close to optimal. Our main technical tool is an entropy power inequality bounding the entropy produced as two quantum signals combine at a beamsplitter. Its proof relies on a quantum diffusion process which smooths arbitrary states towards Gaussians.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IBM TJ Watson Research Center, 1101 Kitchawan Road, Yorktown Heights, 10598, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Robert K\u00f6nig"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Graeme Smith""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Waterloo, N2L3G1, ON, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Robert K\u00f6nig""]}]",False,"[""Robert K\u00f6nig"", ""Graeme Smith""]","König, R., Smith, G.

article,Experimental demonstration of a receiver beating the standard quantum limit for multiple nonorthogonal state discrimination,"<p>Measurement of the state of a quantum system with inherent quantum uncertainty (noise) approaching the ultimate physical limits is of both technological and fundamental interest. Quantum noise prevents any mutually nonorthogonal quantum states, such as coherent states, from being distinguished with perfect accuracy. Optimized quantum measurements for nonorthogonal coherent states allow, in principle, for state discrimination sensitivities surpassing the standard quantum limit. Realizing quantum receivers that can detect multiple coherent states with sensitivity levels approaching the ultimate quantum limits is fundamental to quantum-enhanced measurements, and can optimize the performance of quantum and classical communications as well as future implementations of quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate the first quantum receiver that unconditionally discriminates four nonorthogonal coherent states with error probabilities below the standard quantum limit. This receiver achieves error rates four times lower than is possible with any ideal conventional receiver with perfect detection efficiency.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland and National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, 20899, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""F.

article,Strain-induced pseudomagnetic field and photonic Landau levels in dielectric structures,"<p>Magnetic effects at optical frequencies are notoriously weak, so magneto-optical devices must be large to create a sufficient effect. In graphene, it has been shown that inhomogeneous strains can induce &#8216;pseudomagnetic fields&#8217; that behave in a similar manner to real ones. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that it is possible to induce such a field at optical frequencies in a photonic lattice. To our knowledge, this is the first realization of a pseudomagnetic field in optics. The field yields &#8216;photonic Landau levels&#8217; separated by bandgaps in the spatial spectrum of the structured dielectric lattice. The gaps between these highly degenerate levels lead to transverse optical confinement. The use of strain allows for the exploration of magnetic-like effects in a non-resonant way that would be otherwise inaccessible in optics. It also suggests the possibility that aperiodic photonic-crystal structures can achieve greater field enhancement and slow-light effects than periodic structures via high density of states at the Landau levels. Generalizing these concepts to systems beyond optics, such as matter waves in optical potentials, offers new intriguing physics that is fundamentally different from that in purely periodic structures.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physics Department, Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, 32000, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Mikael C.
