review article,Optics of photonic quasicrystals,"<p>The physics of periodic systems are of fundamental importance and result in various phenomena that govern wave transport and interference. However, deviations from periodicity may result in higher complexity and give rise to a number of surprising effects. One such deviation can be found in the field of optics in the realization of photonic quasicrystals, a class of structures made from building blocks that are arranged using well-designed patterns but lack translational symmetry. Nevertheless, these structures, which lie between periodic and disordered structures, still show sharp diffraction patterns that confirm the existence of wave interference resulting from their long-range order. In this Review, we discuss the beautiful physics unravelled in photonic quasicrystals of one, two and three dimensions, and describe how they can influence optical transmission and reflectivity, photoluminescence, light transport, plasmonics and laser action.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, 84112, Utah, USA"", ""authors"": [""Z.

review article,Disordered photonics,"<p>What do lotus flowers have in common with human bones, liquid crystals with colloidal suspensions, and white beetles with the beautiful stones of the Taj Mahal? The answer is they all feature disordered structures that strongly scatter light, in which light waves entering the material are scattered several times before exiting in random directions. These randomly distributed rays interfere with each other, leading to interesting, and sometimes unexpected, physical phenomena. This Review describes the physics behind the optical properties of disordered structures and how knowledge of multiple light scattering can be used to develop new applications. The field of disordered photonics has grown immensely over the past decade, ranging from investigations into fundamental topics such as Anderson localization and other transport phenomena, to applications in imaging, random lasing and solar energy.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""European Laboratory for Non-linear Spectroscopy, University of Florence, Via Nello Carrara 1 - 50019, Sesto Fiorentino (Firenze), Italy"", ""authors"": [""Diederik S.

review article,Anderson localization of light,"<p>Over the past decade, the Anderson localization of light and a wide variety of associated phenomena have come to the forefront of research. Numerous investigations have been made into the underlying physics of how disorder affects transport in a crystalline lattice incorporating disorder. The physics involved relies on the analogy between the paraxial equation for electromagnetic waves and the Schr&#246;dinger equation describing quantum phenomena. Experiments have revealed how wavefunctions evolve during the localization process, and have led to discoveries of new physics that are universal to wave systems incorporating disorder.

letter,In vivo three-photon microscopy of subcortical structures within an intact mouse brain,"<p>Two-photon fluorescence microscopy enables scientists in various fields including neuroscience, embryology and oncology to visualize in vivo and ex vivo tissue morphology and physiology at a cellular level deep within scattering tissue. However, tissue scattering limits the maximum imaging depth of two-photon fluorescence microscopy to the cortical layer within mouse brain, and imaging subcortical structures currently requires the removal of overlying brain tissue or the insertion of optical probes. Here, we demonstrate non-invasive, high-resolution, in vivo imaging of subcortical structures within an intact mouse brain using three-photon fluorescence microscopy at a spectral excitation window of 1,700&#160;nm. Vascular structures as well as red fluorescent protein-labelled neurons within the mouse hippocampus are imaged. The combination of the long excitation wavelength and the higher-order nonlinear excitation overcomes the limitations of two-photon fluorescence microscopy, enabling biological investigations to take place at a greater depth within tissue.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nicholas G.

letter,Achieving few-femtosecond time-sorting at hard X-ray free-electron lasers,"<p>Recently, few-femtosecond pulses have become available at hard X-ray free-electron lasers. Coupled with the available sub-10 fs optical pulses, investigations into few-femtosecond dynamics are not far off. However, achieving sufficient synchronization between optical lasers and X-ray pulses continues to be challenging. We report a &#8216;measure-and-sort&#8217; approach, which achieves sub-10 fs root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) error measurement at hard X-ray FELs, far beyond the 100&#8211;200 fs r.m.s. jitter limitations. This timing diagnostic, now routinely available at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), is based on ultrafast free-carrier generation in optically transparent materials. Correlation between two independent measurements enables unambiguous demonstration of &#8764;6 fs r.m.s. error in reporting the optical/X-ray delay, with single shot error suggesting the possibility of reaching few-femtosecond resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Hamburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""M.

letter,Quantum-state transfer from an ion to a photon,"<p>One model for quantum networks is based on the probabilistic measurement of two photons, each entangled with a distant node, such as an atom or atomic ensemble. A second, deterministic model transfers information directly from an atom onto a cavity photon, which carries it to a second node, as recently demonstrated with neutral atoms. In both cases, the challenge is to transfer information efficiently while preserving coherence. Here, following the second scheme, we map the quantum state of an ion onto a photon within an optical cavity. Using an ion enables deterministic state initialization, while the cavity provides coherent coupling to a well-defined output mode. Although it is often assumed that a cavity-based quantum interface requires the strong coupling regime, we show transfer fidelities of 92% in the presence of non-negligible decoherence and characterize the interplay between fidelity and efficiency. Our time-independent mapping process offers a promising route towards ion-based quantum networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik, Universit\u00e4t Innsbruck, Technikerstra\u00dfe 25, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria"", ""authors"": [""A.

article,Calculating unknown eigenvalues with a quantum algorithm,"<p>A quantum algorithm solves computational tasks using fewer physical resources than the best-known classical algorithm. Of most interest are those for which an exponential reduction is achieved. The key example is the phase estimation algorithm, which provides the quantum speedup in Shor's factoring algorithm and quantum simulation algorithms. To date, fully quantum experiments of this type have demonstrated only the read-out stage of quantum algorithms, but not the steps in which input data is read in and processed to calculate the final quantum state. Indeed, knowing the answer beforehand was essential. We present a photonic demonstration of a full quantum algorithm&#8212;the iterative phase estimation algorithm (IPEA)&#8212;without knowing the answer in advance. This result suggests practical applications of the phase estimation algorithm, including quantum simulations and quantum metrology in the near term, and factoring in the long term.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""H.

article,Biological measurement beyond the quantum limit,"<p>Dynamic biological measurements require low light levels to avoid damaging the specimen. With this constraint on optical power, quantum noise fundamentally limits the measurement sensitivity. This limit can only be surpassed by extracting more information per photon by using quantum correlations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the quantum shot noise limit can be overcome for measurements of living systems. Quantum-correlated light with amplitude noise squeezed 75% below the vacuum level is used to perform microrheology experiments within Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells. Naturally occurring lipid granules are tracked in real time as they diffuse through the cytoplasm, and the quantum noise limit is surpassed by 42%. The laser-based microparticle tracking technique used is compatible with non-classical light and is immune to low-frequency noise, leading the way to achieving a broad range of quantum-enhanced measurements in biology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Queensland, St Lucia, 4072, Queensland, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Michael A.

article,Frequency-upconverted stimulated emission by simultaneous five-photon absorption,"<p>Since the invention of the laser in 1960, multiphoton effects have become useful in techniques for real applications as well as conceptual predictions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of frequency-upconverted stimulated emission from a novel fluorophore through simultaneous five-photon absorption. Compared to lower-order nonlinear absorption, the fifth-order dependence on input light intensity of the five-photon absorption process will provide much stronger spatial confinement, allowing the achievement of a much higher contrast in imaging. Stimulated emission has also been achieved by the absorption of two to four photons under near-infrared laser excitation, making this gain medium a promising multiphoton imaging probe with attractive features, including the absence of autofluorescence from biological samples, large penetration depth, and improved sensitivity and resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of Structural Chemistry and Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials Chemistry and Physics, Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fuzhou, 350002, Fujian, China"", ""authors"": [""Qingdong Zheng"", "",\u00a0Haomiao Zhu"", "",\u00a0Shan-Ci Chen"", "",\u00a0Changquan Tang"", "",\u00a0En Ma"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xueyuan Chen""]}]",False,"[""Qingdong Zheng"", ""Haomiao Zhu"", ""Shan-Ci Chen"", ""Changquan Tang"", ""En Ma"", ""Xueyuan Chen""]","Zheng, Q., Zhu, H., Chen, S. et al.

article,Efficient colour splitters for high-pixel-density image sensors,"<p>When the pixel size of image sensors shrinks to the wavelength of light, this results in low signal levels for a given photon flux per pixel as a result of scaling laws. Because many image sensors require colour filters, it becomes crucial for small-pixel sensors to have an efficient filtering method that can capture all incident photons without absorbing them. Here, we propose a new method to split colours by using a microscale plate-like structure with a transparent medium that has a higher refractive index than the surrounding material. We experimentally demonstrate that this principle of colour splitting based on near-field deflection can generate colour images with minimal signal loss. From comparisons of the sum of the total integrated values for the colour channels, we confirm the amount of light received is 1.85 times that of the conventional colour filter method of the Bayer array, while maintaining the same level of resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Device Solutions Center, Panasonic Corporation, 3-1-1 Yagumo-nakamachi, Moriguchi City, Osaka, 570-8501, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Seiji Nishiwaki"", "",\u00a0Tatsuya Nakamura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masa-aki Suzuki""]}, {""address"": ""Cloud Solutions Center, Panasonic Corporation, 1006 \u00d4aza-Kadoma, Kadoma City, Osaka, 571-8501, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Masao Hiramoto""]}, {""address"": ""Image Sensor Business Unit, Semiconductor Business Group, Industrial Devices Company, Panasonic Corporation, 1\u00a0K\u00f4tari-yakemachi, Nagaokaky\u00f4 City, Kyoto, 617-8520, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Toshiya Fujii""]}]",False,"[""Seiji Nishiwaki"", ""Tatsuya Nakamura"", ""Masao Hiramoto"", ""Toshiya Fujii"", ""Masa-aki Suzuki""]","Nishiwaki, S., Nakamura, T., Hiramoto, M. et al.

article,Wide-field optical detection of nanoparticles using on-chip microscopy and self-assembled nanolenses,"<p>The direct observation of nanoscale objects is a challenging task for optical microscopy because the scattering from an individual nanoparticle is typically weak at optical wavelengths. Electron microscopy therefore remains one of the gold standard visualization methods for nanoparticles, despite its high cost, limited throughput and restricted field-of-view. Here, we describe a high-throughput, on-chip detection scheme that uses biocompatible wetting films to self-assemble aspheric liquid nanolenses around individual nanoparticles to enhance the contrast between the scattered and background light. We model the effect of the nanolens as a spatial phase mask centred on the particle and show that the holographic diffraction pattern of this effective phase mask allows detection of sub-100&#160;nm particles across a large field-of-view of &gt;20&#160;mm<sup>2</sup>.
