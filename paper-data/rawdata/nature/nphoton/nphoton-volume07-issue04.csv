letter,Functional patterned multiphoton excitation deep inside scattering tissue,"<p>Stochastic distortion of light beams in scattering samples makes in-depth photoexcitation in brain tissue a major challenge. A common solution for overcoming scattering involves adaptive pre-compensation of the unknown distortion. However, this requires long iterative searches for sample-specific optimized corrections, which is a problem when applied to optical neurostimulation where typical timescales in the system are in the millisecond range. Thus, photoexcitation in scattering media that is independent of the properties of a specific sample would be an ideal solution. Here, we show that temporally focused two-photon excitation with generalized phase contrast enables photoexcitation of arbitrary spatial patterns within turbid tissues with remarkable robustness to scattering. We demonstrate three-dimensional confinement of tailored photoexcitation patterns &gt;200&#160;&#181;m in depth, both in numerical simulations and through brain slices combined with patch-clamp recording of photoactivated channelrhodopsin-2.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Neurophysiology and New Microscopies Laboratory, Wavefront Engineering Microscopy Group, CNRS UMR 8154, INSERM U603, Paris Descartes University, 45 rue des Saints P\u00e8res, Paris Cedex 06, 75270, France"", ""authors"": [""Eirini Papagiakoumou"", "",\u00a0Aur\u00e9lien B\u00e8gue"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Valentina Emiliani""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Ben Leshem"", "",\u00a0Osip Schwartz"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dan Oron""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratory of Brain Physiology, CNRS UMR 8118, Paris Descartes University, 45 rue des Saints P\u00e8res, Paris Cedex 06, 75270, France"", ""authors"": [""Brandon M.

letter,Towards high-capacity fibre-optic communications at the speed of light in vacuum,"<p>Wide-bandwidth signal transmission with low latency is emerging as a key requirement in a number of applications, including the development of future exaflop-scale supercomputers, financial algorithmic trading and cloud computing. Optical fibres provide unsurpassed transmission bandwidth, but light propagates 31% slower in a silica glass fibre than in vacuum, thus compromising latency. Air guidance in hollow-core fibres can reduce fibre latency very significantly. However, state-of-the-art technology cannot achieve the combined values of loss, bandwidth and mode-coupling characteristics required for high-capacity data transmission. Here, we report a fundamentally improved hollow-core photonic-bandgap fibre that provides a record combination of low loss (3.5&#160;dB&#160;km<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and wide bandwidth (160&#160;nm), and use it to transmit 37&#160;&#215;&#160;40&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> channels at a 1.54&#160;&#181;s&#160;km<sup>&#8722;1</sup> faster speed than in a conventional fibre.

letter,Silicon coupled with plasmon nanocavities generates bright visible hot luminescence,"<p>To address the limitations in device speed and performance in silicon-based electronics, there have been extensive studies on silicon optoelectronics with a view to achieving ultrafast optical data processing. The biggest challenge has been to develop an efficient silicon-based light source, because the indirect bandgap of silicon gives rise to extremely low emission efficiencies. Although light emission in quantum-confined silicon at sub-10&#160;nm length scales has been demonstrated, there are difficulties in integrating quantum structures with conventional electronics. It is desirable to develop new concepts to obtain emission from silicon at length scales compatible with current electronic devices (20&#8211;100&#160;nm), which therefore do not utilize quantum-confinement effects. Here, we demonstrate an entirely new method to achieve bright visible light emission in &#8216;bulk-sized&#8217; silicon coupled with plasmon nanocavities at room temperature, from non-thermalized carrier recombination. The highly enhanced emission (internal quantum efficiency of &gt;1%) in plasmonic silicon, together with its size compatibility with current silicon electronics, provides new avenues for developing monolithically integrated light sources on conventional microchips.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 19104, Pennsylvania, USA"", ""authors"": [""Chang-Hee Cho"", "",\u00a0Carlos O.

letter,Exploiting shot noise correlations in the photodetection of ultrashort optical pulse trains,"<p>Photocurrent shot noise represents the fundamental quantum limit for amplitude, phase and timing measurements of optical signals. It is generally assumed that non-classical states of light must be employed to alter the standard, time-invariant shot noise detection limit. However, in the detection of periodic signals, correlations in the shot noise spectrum can impact the quantum limit of detection. Here, we show how these correlations can be exploited to improve shot noise-limited optical pulse timing measurements by several orders of magnitude. This has allowed us to realize a photodetected pulse train timing noise floor at an unprecedented 25&#160;zs&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> (corresponding phase noise of &#8722;179&#160;dBc&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1</sup> on a 10 GHz carrier), &#8764;5 dB below the level predicted by the accepted time-invariant shot noise behaviour.

article,Weyl points and line nodes in gyroid photonic crystals,"<p>Weyl points and line nodes are three-dimensional linear point and line degeneracies between two bands. In contrast to two-dimensional Dirac points, which are their lower-dimensional analogues, Weyl points are stable in momentum space, and the associated surface states are predicted to be topologically non-trivial. However, Weyl points are yet to be discovered in nature. Here, we report photonic crystals based on double-gyroid structures, exhibiting frequency-isolated Weyl points with complete phase diagrams by breaking the parity and time-reversal symmetries. Gapless surface dispersions associated with non-zero Chern numbers are demonstrated. Line nodes are also found in similar geometries, the associated surface states forming flat dispersion bands.

article,Speckle-scale focusing in the diffusive regime with time reversal of variance-encoded light (TROVE),"<p>Focusing of light in the diffusive regime inside scattering media has long been considered impossible. Recently, this limitation has been overcome with time reversal of ultrasound-encoded light (TRUE), but the resolution of this approach is fundamentally limited by the large number of optical modes within the ultrasound focus. Here, we introduce a new approach, time reversal of variance-encoded light (TROVE), which demixes these spatial modes by variance encoding to break the resolution barrier imposed by the ultrasound. By encoding individual spatial modes inside the scattering sample with unique variances, we effectively uncouple the system resolution from the size of the ultrasound focus.

article,Single-nanowire solar cells beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit,"<p>Light management is of great importance in photovoltaic cells, as it determines the fraction of incident light entering the device. An optimal p&#8211;n junction combined with optimal light absorption can lead to a solar cell efficiency above the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. Here, we show how this is possible by studying photocurrent generation for a single core&#8211;shell p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction GaAs nanowire solar cell grown on a silicon substrate. At 1&#160;sun illumination, a short-circuit current of 180&#160;mA&#160;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup> is obtained, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that predicted from the Lambert&#8211;Beer law.

article,Quantum teleportation using a light-emitting diode,"<p>Teleportation of optical qubits can enable reliable logic operations in massively parallel quantum computers, as well as the formation of secure quantum networks. Photon teleportation has previously used laser-generated entangled photons created in random quantities. However, the practical complexities of the generating scheme coupled with errors caused by multipair emission have complicated its deployment in useful quantum information technology. Here, we demonstrate teleportation of single photonic qubits, mediated by individual pairs of entangled photons generated by an electrically driven entangled light source realized by embedding a single semiconductor quantum dot within a light-emitting diode. Teleportation is achieved with six general input states, with asymmetrically distributed fidelities, and an average fidelity above the limit possible with classical light. A theoretical framework is created that reproduces our experiments with close agreement. The unique sub-Poissonian nature of our photonic teleporter together with its electrical operation will help lift the complexity restriction of future quantum information applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Toshiba Research Europe Limited, 208 Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge, CB4 0GZ, UK"", ""authors"": [""J.

article,Full characterization of polarization states of light via direct measurement,"<p>Ascertaining the physical state of a system is vital in order to understand and predict its behaviour. However, due to their fragile nature, the direct observation of quantum states has, until recently, been elusive. Historically, determination of the quantum state has been performed indirectly through the use of tomography. We report on two experiments showing that an alternative approach can be used to determine the polarization quantum state in a simple, fast and general manner. The first experiment entails the direct measurement of the probability amplitudes describing pure polarization states of light, the first such measurement on a two-level system. The second experiment entails the direct measurement of the Dirac distribution (a phase-space quasi-probability distribution informationally equivalent to the density matrix), demonstrating that the direct measurement procedure is applicable to general (that is, potentially mixed) quantum states. Our work has applications to measurements in foundational quantum mechanics, quantum information and quantum metrology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, K1N 6N5, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Jeff Z.

article,Anderson localization of entangled photons in an integrated quantum walk,"<p>First predicted for quantum particles in the presence of a disordered potential, Anderson localization is a ubiquitous effect, observed also in classical systems, arising from the destructive interference of waves propagating in static disordered media. Here we report the observation of this phenomenon for pairs of polarization-entangled photons in a discrete quantum walk affected by position-dependent disorder. By exploiting polarization entanglement of photons to simulate different quantum statistics, we experimentally investigate the interplay between the Anderson localization mechanism and the bosonic/fermionic symmetry of the wavefunction. The disordered lattice is realized by an integrated array of interferometers fabricated in glass by femtosecond laser writing. A novel technique is used to introduce a controlled phase shift into each unit mesh of the network. This approach yields great potential for quantum simulation and for implementing a computational power beyond the one of a classical computer in the &#8216;hard-to-simulate&#8217; scenario.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Istituto di Fotonica e Nanotecnologie, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IFN-CNR), Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, 32, Milano, I-20133, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Andrea Crespi"", "",\u00a0Roberto Osellame"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Roberta Ramponi""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, Politecnico di Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, 32, Milano, I-20133, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Andrea Crespi"", "",\u00a0Roberto Osellame"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Roberta Ramponi""]}, {""address"": ""NEST, Scuola Normale Superiore and Istituto di Nanoscienze - CNR, Pisa, I-56126, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Vittorio Giovannetti"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Rosario Fazio""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117542, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Rosario Fazio""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Piazzale Aldo Moro, 5, Roma, I-00185, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Linda Sansoni"", "",\u00a0Francesco De Nicola"", "",\u00a0Fabio Sciarrino"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Paolo Mataloni""]}, {""address"": ""Istituto Nazionale di Ottica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (INO-CNR), Largo Enrico Fermi, 6, Firenze, I-50125, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Fabio Sciarrino"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Paolo Mataloni""]}]",False,"[""Andrea Crespi"", ""Roberto Osellame"", ""Roberta Ramponi"", ""Vittorio Giovannetti"", ""Rosario Fazio"", ""Linda Sansoni"", ""Francesco De Nicola"", ""Fabio Sciarrino"", ""Paolo Mataloni""]","Crespi, A., Osellame, R., Ramponi, R. et al.

article,Quantum control of a spin qubit coupled to a photonic crystal cavity,"<p>A key ingredient for a quantum network is an interface between stationary quantum bits and photons, which act as flying qubits for interactions and communication. Photonic crystal architectures are promising platforms for enhancing the coupling of light to solid-state qubits. Quantum dots can be integrated into a photonic crystal, with optical transitions coupling to photons and spin states forming a long-lived quantum memory. Many researchers have now succeeded in coupling these emitters to photonic crystal cavities, but there have been no demonstrations of a functional spin qubit and quantum gates in this environment. Here, we have developed a coupled cavity&#8211;quantum dot system in which the dot is controllably charged with a single electron. We perform the initialization, rotation and measurement of a single electron spin qubit using laser pulses, and find that the cavity can significantly improve these processes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, 20375, District of Columbia, USA"", ""authors"": [""Samuel G.
