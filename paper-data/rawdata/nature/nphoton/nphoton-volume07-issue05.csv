letter,Spectral compression of single photons,"<p>Photons are critical to quantum technologies because they can be used for virtually all quantum information tasks, for example, in quantum metrology, as the information carrier in photonic quantum computation, as a mediator in hybrid systems, and to establish long-distance networks. The physical characteristics of photons in these applications differ drastically; spectral bandwidths span 12 orders of magnitude from 50&#160;THz (ref.&#160;) for quantum-optical coherence tomography to 50&#160;Hz for certain quantum memories. Combining these technologies requires coherent interfaces that reversibly map centre frequencies and bandwidths of photons to avoid excessive loss. Here, we demonstrate bandwidth compression of single photons by a factor of 40 as well as tunability over a range 70 times that bandwidth via sum-frequency generation with chirped laser pulses. This constitutes a time-to-frequency interface for light capable of converting time-bin to colour entanglement, and enables ultrafast timing measurements. It is a step towards arbitrary waveform generation for single and entangled photons.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, Canada"", ""authors"": [""J.

letter,Plasmonic nano-protractor based on polarization spectro-tomography,"<p>The detection of molecular and nanoparticle labels with nanometre spatial resolution is of great interest for biomolecular and material sciences. Nanosensors capable of monitoring bending and rotations of biomolecules or characterizing soft materials assembled using DNA as scaffolds are highly desirable. A powerful idea incorporated in optical spectroscopic rulers is to transduce changes in spatial arrangement into spectral differences. With few exceptions, current spectroscopic rulers such as fluorescent resonant energy transfer and the recently demonstrated plasmonic ruler provide merely one-dimensional information about the distance between labelling entities. Here, we propose and demonstrate a three-dimensional spectroscopic nanosensor, called a &#8216;plasmonic protractor&#8217;, based on a plasmonic nanostructure formed between a plasmonic sphere and a nanolabel attached to it. A polarization-resolved scattering technique enables the reconstruction of the nanolabel's location and orientation with deep subdiffraction spatial resolution. This plasmonic far-field, in situ spatial arrangement sensor greatly expands the capability of existing spectroscopic rulers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and the Center for Complex Quantum Systems, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, 78712, Texas, USA"", ""authors"": [""Farbod Shafiei"", "",\u00a0Chihhui Wu"", "",\u00a0Yanwen Wu"", "",\u00a0Alexander B.

letter,A quantum logic gate between a solid-state quantum bit and a photon,"<p>Integrated nanophotonic devices create strong light&#8211;matter interactions that are important for the development of solid-state quantum networks, distributed quantum computers and ultralow-power optoelectronics. A key component for many of these applications is the photonic quantum logic gate, where the quantum state of a solid-state quantum bit (qubit) conditionally controls the state of a photonic qubit. These gates are crucial for the development of robust quantum networks, non-destructive quantum measurements and strong photon&#8211;photon interactions. Here, we experimentally realize a quantum logic gate between an optical photon and a solid-state qubit. The qubit is composed of a quantum dot strongly coupled to a nanocavity, which acts as a coherently controllable qubit system that conditionally flips the polarization of a photon on picosecond timescales, implementing a controlled-NOT gate. Our results represent an important step towards solid-state quantum networks and provide a versatile approach for probing quantum dot&#8211;photon interactions on ultrafast timescales.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IREAP, University of Maryland, College Park and Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hyochul Kim"", "",\u00a0Ranojoy Bose"", "",\u00a0Thomas C.

letter,Experimental demonstration of long-distance continuous-variable quantum key distribution,"<p>Distributing secret keys with information-theoretic security is arguably one of the most important achievements of the field of quantum information processing and communications. The rapid progress in this field has enabled quantum key distribution in real-world conditions and commercial devices are now readily available. Quantum key distribution systems based on continuous variables provide the major advantage that they only require standard telecommunication technology. However, to date, these systems have been considered unsuitable for long-distance communication. Here, we overcome all previous limitations and demonstrate for the first time continuous-variable quantum key distribution over 80&#160;km of optical fibre. All aspects of a practical scenario are considered, including the use of finite-size data blocks for secret information computation and key distillation.

letter,Air-to-ground quantum communication,"<p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the first commercial application in the new field of quantum information, with first routine applications in government and financial sectors and with successful demonstrations of trusted node networks. Today, the main goal is efficient long-range key distribution via either quantum repeaters or satellites, with a view to enabling global secure communication. En route to achieving QKD via satellites, a free-space demonstration of secure key distribution was performed between two ground stations, over a distance of 144&#160;km. This scenario is comparable to links between satellites in low Earth orbit and ground stations with respect to both attenuation and fluctuations. However, key exchange with rapidly moving platforms remained to be demonstrated. Here, we prove, for the first time, the feasibility of BB84 QKD between an aeroplane and a ground station.

article,Direct and full-scale experimental verifications towards ground–satellite quantum key distribution,"<p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides the only intrinsically unconditional secure method for communication based on the principle of quantum mechanics. Compared with fibre-based demonstrations, free-space links could provide the most appealing solution for communication over much larger distances. Despite significant efforts, all realizations to date rely on stationary sites. Experimental verifications are therefore extremely crucial for applications to a typical low Earth orbit satellite. To achieve direct and full-scale verifications of our set-up, we have carried out three independent experiments with a decoy-state QKD system, and overcome all conditions.

article,Damping pathways of mid-infrared plasmons in graphene nanostructures,"<p>Plasmon is the quantum of the collective oscillation of electrons. How plasmon loses its energy (or damping) plays a pivotal role in plasmonic science and technology. Graphene plasmon is of particular interest, partly because of its potentially low damping rate. However, to date, damping pathways have not been clearly unravelled experimentally. Here, we demonstrate mid-infrared (4&#8211;15 &#181;m) plasmons in graphene nanostructures with dimensions as small as 50 nm (with a mode area of &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>&#160;&#181;m<sup>2</sup>). We also reveal damping channels via graphene intrinsic optical phonons and scattering from the edges. Plasmon lifetimes of 20&#160;fs or less are observed when damping via the emission of graphene optical phonons is allowed. Furthermore, surface polar phonons in the SiO<sub>2</sub> substrate under graphene nanostructures lead to a significantly modified plasmon dispersion and damping, in contrast to the case of a nonpolar diamond-like-carbon substrate. Our study paves the way for applications of graphene in plasmonic waveguides, modulators and detectors from sub-terahertz to mid-infrared regimes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IBM Thomas J.

article,A polymer optoelectronic interface restores light sensitivity in blind rat retinas,"<p>Interfacing organic electronics with biological substrates offers new possibilities for biotechnology by taking advantage of the beneficial properties exhibited by organic conducting polymers. These polymers have been used for cellular interfaces in several applications, including cellular scaffolds, neural probes, biosensors and actuators for drug release. Recently, an organic photovoltaic blend has been used for neuronal stimulation via a photo-excitation process. Here, we document the use of a single-component organic film of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to trigger neuronal firing upon illumination. Moreover, we demonstrate that this bio&#8211;organic interface restores light sensitivity in explants of rat retinas with light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. These findings suggest that all-organic devices may play an important future role in subretinal prosthetic implants.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Neuroscience and Brain Technologies, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova 16163, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Diego Ghezzi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Fabio Benfenati""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Nano Science and Technology@PoliMi, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milano 20133, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Maria Rosa Antognazza"", "",\u00a0Sebastiano Bellani"", "",\u00a0Erica Lanzarini"", "",\u00a0Nicola Martino"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Guglielmo Lanzani""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento di Tecnologie Biomediche, Universit\u00e0 dell'Aquila, L'Aquila, 67100, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Rita Maccarone"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Silvia Bisti""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Politecnico di Milano, Piazza L.

article,High-efficiency quantum-dot light-emitting devices with enhanced charge injection,"<p>We report a colour-saturated, red quantum-dot light-emitting device (QLED) using an inverted organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid device structure and colloidal CdSe&#8211;CdS (core&#8211;shell) quantum-dot emitters. The strong electronic coupling of quantum dots to an adjacent layer of ZnO nanocrystals (which form the electron transport layer) facilitates charge transfer, which is responsible for both injecting electrons and maintaining an optimal charge balance for the quantum dot emitters. We show that QLED performance can be modified by controlling the distance of the electroluminescence recombination zone within the quantum dot film from the quantum dot&#8211;ZnO interface. Devices are reported with a luminous efficiency of 19&#160;cd&#160;A<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 18% (which is close to the theoretical maximum of 20%) and an internal quantum efficiency of 90%.

article,Mesoscopic light transport by very strong collective multiple scattering in nanowire mats,"<p>Under the extreme condition of the scattering length being much shorter than the wavelength, light transport in random media is strongly modified by mesoscopic interference, and can even be halted in an effect known as Anderson localization. Anderson localization in three dimensions has recently been realized for acoustic waves and for cold atoms. Mats of disordered, high-refractive-index semiconductor nanowires are one of the strongest three-dimensional scattering materials for light, but localization has not been shown. Here, we use statistical methods originally developed for microwave waveguides to demonstrate that transport of light through nanowire mats is strongly correlated and governed by mesoscopic interference contributions. Our results confirm the contribution of only a few open modes to the transmission.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Faculty of Physical and Applied Sciences, University of Southampton, Highfield, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK"", ""authors"": [""Tom Strudley"", "",\u00a0Claire Blejean"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Otto L.
