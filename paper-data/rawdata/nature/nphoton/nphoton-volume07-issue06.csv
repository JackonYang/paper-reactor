letter,Optical two-way time and frequency transfer over free space,"<p>The transfer of high-quality time&#8211;frequency signals between remote locations underpins many applications, including precision navigation and timing, clock-based geodesy, long-baseline interferometry, coherent radar arrays, tests of general relativity and fundamental constants, and future redefinition of the second. However, present microwave-based time&#8211;frequency transfer is inadequate for state-of-the-art optical clocks and oscillators that have femtosecond-level timing jitter and accuracies below 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;17</sup>. Commensurate optically based transfer methods are therefore needed. Here we demonstrate optical time&#8211;frequency transfer over free space via two-way exchange between coherent frequency combs, each phase-locked to the local optical oscillator. We achieve 1&#160;fs timing deviation, residual instability below 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;18</sup> at 1,000&#160;s and systematic offsets below 4&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;19</sup>, despite frequent signal fading due to atmospheric turbulence or obstructions across the 2&#160;km link. This free-space transfer can enable terrestrial links to support clock-based geodesy. Combined with satellite-based optical communications, it provides a path towards global-scale geodesy, high-accuracy time&#8211;frequency distribution and satellite-based relativity experiments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Standards and Technology, 325 Broadway, Boulder, 80305, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Fabrizio R.

letter,Quantum tele-amplification with a continuous-variable superposition state,"<p>Optical coherent states are classical light fields with high purity, and are essential carriers of information in optical networks. If these states could be controlled in the quantum regime, allowing for their quantum superposition (referred to as a Schr&#246;dinger-cat state), then novel quantum-enhanced functions such as coherent-state quantum computing (CSQC), quantum metrology and a quantum repeater could be realized in the networks. Optical cat states are now routinely generated in laboratories. An important next challenge is to use them for implementing the aforementioned functions. Here, we demonstrate a basic CSQC protocol, where a cat state is used as an entanglement resource for teleporting a coherent state with an amplitude gain. We also show how this can be extended to a loss-tolerant quantum relay of multi-ary phase-shift keyed coherent states. These protocols could be useful in both optical and quantum communications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), 4-2-1 Nukui-kitamachi, Koganei, 184-8795, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Jonas S.

letter,Real-time in vivo computed optical interferometric tomography,"<p>High-resolution real-time tomography of scattering tissues is important for many areas of medicine and biology. However, the compromise between transverse resolution and depth-of-field, in addition to low sensitivity deep in tissue, continues to impede progress towards cellular-level volumetric tomography. Computed imaging has the potential to solve these long-standing limitations. Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy is a computed imaging technique enabling high-resolution volumetric tomography with spatially invariant resolution. However, its potential for clinical diagnostics remains largely untapped because full volume reconstructions required lengthy post-processing, and the phase-stability requirements have been difficult to satisfy in vivo. Here, we demonstrate how three-dimensional Fourier-domain resampling, in combination with high-speed optical coherence tomography, can achieve high-resolution in vivo tomography. Enhanced depth sensitivity was achieved over a depth of field extended in real time by more than an order of magnitude. This work lays the foundation for high-speed volumetric cellular-level tomography.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 405 N.

letter,Far-field imaging of non-fluorescent species with subdiffraction resolution,"<p>Super-resolution optical microscopy is providing a new means by which to view as yet unseen details on a nanoscopic scale. Current far-field super-resolution techniques rely on fluorescence as the readout. Here, we demonstrate a scheme for breaking the diffraction limit in far-field imaging of non-fluorescent species by using spatially controlled saturation of electronic absorption. Our method is based on a pump&#8211;probe process where a modulated pump field perturbs the charge carrier density in a sample, thus modulating the transmission of a probe field. A doughnut-shaped laser beam is then added to transiently saturate the electronic transition in the periphery of the focal volume, so the induced modulation in the sequential probe pulse only occurs at the focal centre. By raster-scanning the three collinearly aligned beams, high-speed subdiffraction-limited imaging of graphite nanoplatelets is performed. This technique has the potential to enable super-resolution imaging of nanomaterials and non-fluorescent chromophores, which may remain out of reach to fluorescence-based methods.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, 47907, Indiana, USA"", ""authors"": [""Pu Wang"", "",\u00a0Mikhail N.

letter,Subwavelength light focusing using random nanoparticles,"<p>There has been an escalation in interest in developing methods to control the near field because of its role in subwavelength optics. Many novel ideas have emerged in the field of plasmonics, super-resolution optical imaging and lithography, among others. However, the near field generated in plasmonic metamaterials is fundamentally restricted by their predesigned structure, and super-resolution optical techniques do not directly control the near field. Here, we achieve direct control of the optical near field by shaping the wavefront impinging on turbid media consisting of random nanoparticles. The linear relation between input far field and scattered output near fields allows us to coherently control the near field at arbitrary positions. Direct control of the near field through scattering control offers novel approaches for subwavelength optics and may have direct applications in bio- and nanophotonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305\u2013701, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jung-Hoon Park"", "",\u00a0Chunghyun Park"", "",\u00a0HyeonSeung Yu"", "",\u00a0Yong-Hoon Cho"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0YongKeun Park""]}, {""address"": ""Graduate School of Nanoscience and Technology (WCU) and KAIST Institute for the NanoCentury, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305\u2013701, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Chunghyun Park"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yong-Hoon Cho""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Material Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151\u2013742, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jimin Park"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ki Tae Nam""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305\u2013701, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Seungyong Han"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Seung Hwan Ko""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, 305\u2013701, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jonghwa Shin""]}]",False,"[""Jung-Hoon Park"", ""Chunghyun Park"", ""HyeonSeung Yu"", ""Jimin Park"", ""Seungyong Han"", ""Jonghwa Shin"", ""Seung Hwan Ko"", ""Ki Tae Nam"", ""Yong-Hoon Cho"", ""YongKeun Park""]","Park, J., Park, C., Yu, H. et al.

article,Analysis of enhanced light emission from highly strained germanium microbridges,"<p>Tensile strain is a widely discussed means for inducing a direct bandgap in Ge for the realization of a semiconductor laser compatible with Si microelectronics. We present a top-down fabrication approach for creating high uniaxial tensile stress in suspended Ge structures, which enhances&#8212;by a factor of more than 20&#8212;the strain induced by thermal mismatch of Ge layers grown on silicon or silicon-on-insulator substrates. Strain values up to 3.1% are measured using Raman spectroscopy, in excellent agreement with simulations using a biaxial thermal strain of 0.15%. As expected from the high value of strain, a 210&#160;meV peak energy shift in the emission with respect to bulk Ge and a strong increase (&#215;25) in the integrated photoluminescence intensity are observed. Although 3.1% uniaxial strain does not transform Ge into a direct-gap material, our model calculation predicts an optical gain of 460&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>19</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup> n-doped structures at an electron&#8211;hole injection density of 3&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>19</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratory for Micro- and Nanotechnology (LMN), Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, CH-5232, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Enhanced energy storage in chaotic optical resonators,"<p>Chaos is a phenomenon that occurs in many aspects of contemporary science. In classical dynamics, chaos is defined as a hypersensitivity to initial conditions. The presence of chaos is often unwanted, as it introduces unpredictability, which makes it difficult to predict or explain experimental results. Conversely, we demonstrate here how chaos can be used to enhance the ability of an optical resonator to store energy. We combine analytic theory with ab initio simulations and experiments in photonic-crystal resonators to show that a chaotic resonator can store six times more energy than its classical counterpart of the same volume. We explain the observed increase by considering the equipartition of energy among all degrees of freedom of the chaotic resonator (that is, the cavity modes) and discover a convergence of their lifetimes towards a single value. A compelling illustration of the theory is provided by enhanced absorption in deformed polystyrene microspheres.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""PRIMALIGHT, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia"", ""authors"": [""C.

article,Polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells employing Förster resonance energy transfer,"<p>There are two crucial tasks for realizing high-efficiency polymer solar cells (PSCs): increasing the range of the spectral absorption of light and efficiently harvesting photogenerated excitons. Here, we describe F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer-based heterojunction polymer solar cells that incorporate squaraine dye. The high absorbance of squaraine in the near-infrared region broadens the spectral absorption of the solar cells and assists in developing an ordered nanomorphology for enhanced charge transport. Femtosecond spectroscopic studies reveal highly efficient (up to 96%) excitation energy transfer from poly(3-hexylthiophene) to squaraine occurring on a picosecond timescale. We demonstrate a 38% increase in power conversion efficiency to reach 4.5%, and suggest that this system has improved exciton migration over long distances. This architecture transcends traditional multiblend systems, allowing multiple donor materials with separate spectral responses to work synergistically, thereby enabling an improvement in light absorption and conversion. This opens up a new avenue for the development of high-efficiency polymer solar cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, 06511, Connecticut, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jing-Shun Huang"", "",\u00a0Tenghooi Goh"", "",\u00a0Xiaokai Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andr\u00e9 D.

article,Experimental observation of the optical spin–orbit torque,"<p>Electrical and optical control of magnetization are of central importance in the research and applications of spintronics. Non-relativistic angular momentum transfer or relativistic spin&#8211;orbit coupling provide efficient means by which electrical current driven through a ferromagnet can exert a torque on the magnetization. Ferromagnetic semiconductors like (Ga,Mn)As are suitable model systems with which to search for optical counterparts of these phenomena, where photocarriers excited by a laser pulse exert torque upon magnetization. Here, we report the observation of an optical spin&#8211;orbit torque (OSOT) in (Ga,Mn)As. The phenomenon originates from spin&#8211;orbit coupling of non-equilibrium photocarriers excitated by helicity-independent pump laser pulses, which do not impart angular momentum. In our measurements of the time-dependent magnetization trajectories, the signatures of OSOT are clearly distinct from the competing thermal excitation mechanism, and OSOT can even dominate in (Ga,Mn)As materials with appropriately controlled micromagnetic parameters.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague, Ke Karlovu 3, 121 16 Prague 2, Czech Republic"", ""authors"": [""N.
