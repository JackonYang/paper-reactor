letter,Certified quantum non-demolition measurement of a macroscopic material system,"<p>Quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements improve sensitivity by evading measurement back-action. The technique was first proposed to detect mechanical oscillations in gravity-wave detectors and demonstrated in the measurement of optical fields, which led to the development of rigorous criteria to distinguish QND from similar non-classical measurements. Recent QND measurements of macroscopic material systems such as atomic ensembles and mechanical oscillators show some QND features, but not full QND character. Here we demonstrate certified QND measurement of the collective spin of an atomic ensemble. We observed quantum-state preparation (QSP) and information-damage trade-off (IDT) beyond their classical limits by seven and 12 standard deviations, respectively. Our techniques complement recent work with microscopic systems and can be used for quantum metrology and memory, the preparation and detection of non-Gaussian states, and proposed quantum simulation and information protocols. They should enable QND measurements of dynamical quantum variables and the realization of QND-based quantum information protocols.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Av.

letter,Joining the quantum state of two photons into one,"<p>Photons are the ideal carriers of quantum information for communication. Each photon can have a single or multiple qubits encoded in its internal quantum state, as defined by optical degrees of freedom such as polarization, wavelength, transverse modes and so on. However, as photons do not interact, multiplexing and demultiplexing the quantum information across photons has not been possible hitherto. Here, we introduce and demonstrate experimentally a physical process, named &#8216;quantum joining&#8217;, in which the two-dimensional quantum states (qubits) of two input photons are combined into a single output photon, within a four-dimensional Hilbert space. The inverse process is also proposed, in which the four-dimensional quantum state of a single photon is split into two photons, each carrying a qubit. Both processes can be iterated, and hence provide a flexible quantum interconnect to bridge multiparticle protocols of quantum information with multidegree-of-freedom ones, with possible applications in future quantum networking.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, Roma, I-00185, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Chiara Vitelli"", "",\u00a0Nicol\u00f2 Spagnolo"", "",\u00a0Lorenzo Aparo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Fabio Sciarrino""]}, {""address"": ""Center of Life NanoScience at La Sapienza, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Viale Regina Elena, 255, Roma, I-00185, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Chiara Vitelli""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Napoli Federico II, Complesso Universitario di Monte S.

letter,Towards quantum-dot arrays of entangled photon emitters,"<p>To make photonic quantum information a reality, a number of extraordinary challenges need to be overcome. One challenge is to achieve large arrays of reproducible &#8216;entangled&#8217; photon generators, while maintaining compatibility for integration with optical devices and detectors. Semiconductor quantum dots are potentially ideal for this as they allow photons to be generated on demand without relying on probabilistic processes. Nevertheless, most quantum-dot systems are limited by their intrinsic lack of symmetry, which allows only a small number (typically 1 out of 100, or worse) of good dots to be achieved per chip. The recent retraction of Mohan et al. seemed to question the very possibility of simultaneously achieving site control and high symmetry. Here, we show that with a new family of (111)-grown pyramidal site-controlled InGaAs<sub>1&#8211;&#948;</sub>N<sub>&#948;</sub> quantum dots it is possible to overcome previous hurdles and obtain areas with up to 15% of polarization-entangled photon emitters, with fidelities as high as 0.721&#160;&#177;&#160;0.043.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Tyndall National Institute, University College Cork, Lee Maltings, Cork, Ireland"", ""authors"": [""Gediminas Juska"", "",\u00a0Valeria Dimastrodonato"", "",\u00a0Lorenzo O.

letter,"Frequency-agile, rapid scanning spectroscopy","<p>Challenging applications in trace gas measurements require low uncertainty and high acquisition rates. Many cavity-enhanced spectroscopies exhibit significant sensitivity and potential, but their scanning rates are limited by reliance on either mechanical or thermal frequency tuning. Here, we present frequency-agile, rapid scanning spectroscopy (FARS) in which a high-bandwidth electro-optic modulator steps a selected laser sideband to successive optical cavity modes. This approach involves no mechanical motion and allows for a scanning rate of 8&#160;kHz per cavity mode, a rate that is limited only by the cavity response time itself. Unlike rapidly frequency-swept techniques, FARS does not reduce the measurement duty cycle, degrade the spectrum's frequency axis or require an unusual cavity configuration. FARS allows for a sensitivity of &#8764;2 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;12</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> and a tuning range exceeding 70&#160;GHz.

letter,Wideband dye-sensitized solar cells employing a phosphine-coordinated ruthenium sensitizer,"<p>Low-cost renewable energies are necessary for the realization of a low-carbon society. Organic photovoltaics such as organic thin-film solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising candidates for realizing low-cost solar cells. However, device efficiencies are still considerably lower than those of traditional inorganic solar cells. To improve organic photovoltaic performance, approaches are needed to extend the absorption of organic compounds to longer wavelengths. Here, we report efficient DSSCs that exploit near-infrared, spin-forbidden singlet-to-triplet direct transitions in a phosphine-coordinated Ru(II) sensitizer, DX1. A DSSC using DX1 generated a photocurrent density of 26.8&#160;mA&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, the highest value for an organic photovoltaic reported to date.

letter,Experimental boson sampling,"<p>Universal quantum computers promise a dramatic increase in speed over classical computers, but their full-size realization remains challenging. However, intermediate quantum computational models have been proposed that are not universal but can solve problems that are believed to be classically hard. Aaronson and Arkhipov have shown that interference of single photons in random optical networks can solve the hard problem of sampling the bosonic output distribution. Remarkably, this computation does not require measurement-based interactions or adaptive feed-forward techniques. Here, we demonstrate this model of computation using laser-written integrated quantum networks that were designed to implement unitary matrix transformations. We characterize the integrated devices using an in situ reconstruction method and observe three-photon interference that leads to the boson-sampling output distribution. Our results set a benchmark for a type of quantum computer with the potential to outperform a conventional computer through the use of only a few photons and linear-optical elements.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Faculty of Physics, University of Vienna, Boltzmanngasse 5, Vienna, A-1090, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Max Tillmann"", "",\u00a0Borivoje Daki\u0107"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Philip Walther""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Boltzmanngasse 3, Vienna, A-1090, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Max Tillmann"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Philip Walther""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Applied Physics, Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller Universit\u00e4t Jena, Max-Wien-Platz 1, Jena, D-07743, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Ren\u00e9 Heilmann"", "",\u00a0Stefan Nolte"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Alexander Szameit""]}]",False,"[""Max Tillmann"", ""Borivoje Daki\u0107"", ""Ren\u00e9 Heilmann"", ""Stefan Nolte"", ""Alexander Szameit"", ""Philip Walther""]","Tillmann, M., Dakić, B., Heilmann, R. et al.

letter,Integrated multimode interferometers with arbitrary designs for photonic boson sampling,"<p>The evolution of bosons undergoing arbitrary linear unitary transformations quickly becomes hard to predict using classical computers as we increase the number of particles and modes. Photons propagating in a multiport interferometer naturally solve this so-called boson sampling problem, thereby motivating the development of technologies that enable precise control of multiphoton interference in large interferometers. Here, we use novel three-dimensional manufacturing techniques to achieve simultaneous control of all the parameters describing an arbitrary interferometer. We implement a small instance of the boson sampling problem by studying three-photon interference in a five-mode integrated interferometer, confirming the quantum-mechanical predictions. Scaled-up versions of this set-up are a promising way to demonstrate the computational advantage of quantum systems over classical computers.

letter,Selection-rule breakdown in plasmon-induced electronic excitation of an isolated single-walled carbon nanotube,"<p>Optical transitions between electronic levels are restricted according to the selection rules governed by the parities of electronic wavefunctions. If this restriction can be removed, then drastic improvements in the efficiency and diversity of photoreactions may be realized. Because the selection rules are based on the long wavelength approximation, wherein the field amplitude is assumed to be constant within a molecule, a localized plasmon that has an electromagnetic field with a significantly high gradient is expected to violate the conventional limitations of the optical response. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of controlling the optical electronic transitions of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) using metal nanodimers with a controlled nanogap distance. Highly systematic identification of the excitations of individual SWNTs through well-resolved Raman signals implies a breakdown of the selection rules due to the strong field gradient in the radial direction of the SWNTs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, North 10 West 8, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0810, Hokkaido, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Mai Takase"", "",\u00a0Keiichiro Komeda"", "",\u00a0Masanobu Nara"", "",\u00a0Hideki Nabika"", "",\u00a0Satoshi Yasuda"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kei Murakoshi""]}, {""address"": ""Photon Pioneers Center, Osaka University, 2-8 Yamadaoka, Suita, 565-0871, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Hiroshi Ajiki""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics and Electronics, Osaka Prefecture University, 1-1 Gakuen-cho, Naka-ku, Sakai, 599-8531, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yoshihiko Mizumoto"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hajime Ishihara""]}]",False,"[""Mai Takase"", ""Hiroshi Ajiki"", ""Yoshihiko Mizumoto"", ""Keiichiro Komeda"", ""Masanobu Nara"", ""Hideki Nabika"", ""Satoshi Yasuda"", ""Hajime Ishihara"", ""Kei Murakoshi""]","Takase, M., Ajiki, H., Mizumoto, Y. et al.

letter,Towards isolated attosecond pulses at megahertz repetition rates,"<p>The strong-field process of high-harmonic generation is the foundation for generating isolated attosecond pulses, which are the fastest controllable events ever induced. This coherent extreme-ultraviolet radiation has become an indispensable tool for resolving ultrafast motion in atoms and molecules. Despite numerous spectacular developments in the new field of attoscience, the low data-acquisition rates imposed by low-repetition-rate (maximum of 3&#160;kHz) laser systems hamper the advancement of these sophisticated experiments. Consequently, the availability of high-repetition-rate sources will overcome a major obstacle in this young field. Here, we present the first megahertz-level source of extreme-ultraviolet continua with evidence of isolated attosecond pulses using a fibre laser-pumped optical parametric amplifier for high-harmonic generation at 0.6&#160;MHz. This 200-fold increase in repetition rate will enable and promote a vast variety of new applications, such as attosecond-resolution coincidence and photoelectron spectroscopy, or even video-rate acquisition for spatially resolved pump&#8211;probe measurements.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Friedrich-Schiller-Universit\u00e4t Jena, Abbe Center of Photonics, Institute of Applied Physics, Albert-Einstein-Stra\u00dfe 15, 07745, Jena, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Manuel Krebs"", "",\u00a0Steffen H\u00e4drich"", "",\u00a0Stefan Demmler"", "",\u00a0Jan Rothhardt"", "",\u00a0Jens Limpert"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andreas T\u00fcnnermann""]}, {""address"": ""Helmholtz-Institute Jena, Fr\u00f6belstieg 3, 07743, Jena, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Steffen H\u00e4drich"", "",\u00a0Jan Rothhardt"", "",\u00a0Jens Limpert"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andreas T\u00fcnnermann""]}, {""address"": ""Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2AZ, UK"", ""authors"": [""Amelle Za\u00efr""]}, {""address"": ""Max-Born Institute for Nonlinear Optics and Short Pulse Spectroscopy, Max-Born-Stra\u00dfe 2A, Berlin, 12489, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Luke Chipperfield""]}, {""address"": ""Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Albert-Einstein-Stra\u00dfe 7, Jena, 07745, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Andreas T\u00fcnnermann""]}]",False,"[""Manuel Krebs"", ""Steffen H\u00e4drich"", ""Stefan Demmler"", ""Jan Rothhardt"", ""Amelle Za\u00efr"", ""Luke Chipperfield"", ""Jens Limpert"", ""Andreas T\u00fcnnermann""]","Krebs, M., Hädrich, S., Demmler, S. et al.

article,Phase-conjugated twin waves for communication beyond the Kerr nonlinearity limit,"<p>Kerr nonlinearity imposes a limit on the achievable transmission performance and capacity of optical fibre communication links. We show that the nonlinear distortions of a pair of phase-conjugated twin waves are essentially anticorrelated, so cancellation of signal-to-signal nonlinear interactions can be achieved by coherently superimposing the twin waves at the end of the transmission line. We demonstrate that by applying this approach to fibre communication, nonlinear distortions can be reduced by &gt;8.5&#160;dB. In dispersive nonlinear transmission, the nonlinearity cancellation additionally requires a dispersion-symmetry condition that can be satisfied by appropriately predispersing the signals. By using these techniques we succeed in transmitting a 400&#160;Gb&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> superchannel over 12,800&#160;km of fibre. We further show a connection between the nonlinearity cancellation and a nonlinear noise squeezing effect. The concept of using phase-conjugated twin waves to suppress nonlinear interactions may prove beneficial in other physical systems governed by the nonlinear Schr&#246;dinger equation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Bell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent, 791 Holmdel-Keyport Road, Holmdel, 07733, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiang Liu"", "",\u00a0A.

article,Few-fJ/bit data transmissions using directly modulated lambda-scale embedded active region photonic-crystal lasers,"<p>A low operating energy is needed for nanocavity lasers designed for on-chip photonic network applications. On-chip nanocavity lasers must be driven by current because they act as light sources driven by electronic circuits. Here, we report the high-speed direct modulation of a lambda-scale embedded active region photonic-crystal (LEAP) laser that holds three records for any type of laser operated at room temperature: a low threshold current of 4.8&#160;&#181;A, a modulation current efficiency of 2.0&#160;GHz&#160;&#181;A<sup>&#8722;0.5</sup> and an operating energy of 4.4&#160;fJ&#160;bit<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Five major technologies make this performance possible: a compact buried heterostructure, a photonic-crystal nanocavity, a lateral p&#8211;n junction realized by ion implantation and thermal diffusion, an InAlAs sacrificial layer and current-blocking trenches. We believe that an output power of 2.17&#160;&#181;W and an operating energy of 4.4&#160;fJ&#160;bit<sup>&#8722;1</sup> will enable us to realize on-chip photonic networks in combination with the recently developed highly sensitive receivers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1 Morinosato-Wakamiya, Atsugi-shi, 243-0198, Kanagawa, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Koji Takeda"", "",\u00a0Tomonari Sato"", "",\u00a0Wataru Kobayashi"", "",\u00a0Koichi Hasebe"", "",\u00a0Takaaki Kakitsuka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shinji Matsuo""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1 Morinosato-Wakamiya, Atsugi-shi, 243-0198, Kanagawa, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Kengo Nozaki"", "",\u00a0Hideaki Taniyama"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}, {""address"": ""Nanophotonics Center, NTT Corporation, 3-1 Morinosato-Wakamiya, Atsugi-shi, 243-0198, Kanagawa, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Koji Takeda"", "",\u00a0Tomonari Sato"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Kengo Nozaki"", "",\u00a0Hideaki Taniyama"", "",\u00a0Masaya Notomi"", "",\u00a0Koichi Hasebe"", "",\u00a0Takaaki Kakitsuka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shinji Matsuo""]}]",False,"[""Koji Takeda"", ""Tomonari Sato"", ""Akihiko Shinya"", ""Kengo Nozaki"", ""Wataru Kobayashi"", ""Hideaki Taniyama"", ""Masaya Notomi"", ""Koichi Hasebe"", ""Takaaki Kakitsuka"", ""Shinji Matsuo""]","Takeda, K., Sato, T., Shinya, A. et al.
