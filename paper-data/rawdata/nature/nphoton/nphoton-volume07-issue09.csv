review article,Resonant and nonresonant control over matter and light by intense terahertz transients,"<p>Electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz (THz) frequency range is a fascinating spectroscopic tool that provides resonant access to fundamental modes, including the motions of free electrons, the rotations of molecules, the vibrations of crystal lattices and the precessions of spins. Consequently, THz waves have been extensively used to probe such responses with high sensitivity. However, owing to recent developments in high-power sources, scientists have started to abandon the role of pure observers and are now exploiting intense THz radiation to engineer transient states of matter. This Review provides an overview and illustrative examples of how the electric and magnetic fields of intense THz transients can be used to control matter and light resonantly and nonresonantly.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physical Chemistry, Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, Faradayweg 4-6, Berlin, 14195, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Tobias Kampfrath""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8502, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Koichiro Tanaka""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (WPI-iCeMS), Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Koichiro Tanaka""]}, {""address"": ""CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-1-8, Kawaguchi, Saitama, 332-0012, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Koichiro Tanaka""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Keith A.

review article,Wave engineering with THz quantum cascade lasers,"<p>Quantum cascade lasers are compact devices based on mature compound semiconductors such as GaAs that take advantage of highly developed optoelectronic fabrication techniques to integrate linear and nonlinear functions. This Review discusses terahertz-wave engineering using quantum cascade lasers with a particular focus on techniques that have been implemented to control their spectral and output beam properties. After briefly introducing the types of active regions and surveying present maximum operating temperatures, we review several photonic structures used for frequency and beam engineering, ranging from distributed feedback lasers to photonic crystals. We then describe techniques that allow the upconversion of terahertz quantum cascade laser radiation in the near-infrared region using nonlinear intracavity mixing. Finally, we review frequency stabilization of terahertz quantum cascade lasers with a special emphasis on phase locking to near-infrared frequency combs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Mat\u00e9riaux et Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes Quantiques, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot and CNRS, UMR7162, Paris, 75205, France"", ""authors"": [""Carlo Sirtori"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Stefano Barbieri""]}, {""address"": ""Institut d'Electronique Fondamentale, Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud and CNRS, UMR8622, Orsay, 91405, France"", ""authors"": [""Raffaele Colombelli""]}]",False,"[""Carlo Sirtori"", ""Stefano Barbieri"", ""Raffaele Colombelli""]","Sirtori, C., Barbieri, S. & Colombelli, R.

review article,Superconducting emitters of THz radiation,"<p>Layered superconductors such as the copper-oxide high-temperature superconductor Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+&#948;</sub> are emerging as compact sources of coherent continuous-wave electromagnetic radiation in the subterahertz and terahertz frequency ranges. The basis of their operation is the Josephson effect, which intrinsically occurs between the superconducting layers. The Josephson effect naturally converts a direct-current voltage into a high-frequency electric current. Therefore, a unique property of the devices reviewed here is the wide tunability of their frequency by varying the bias voltage. Recently, emission powers of free-space radiation of several hundreds of microwatts and emission linewidths as low as 6 MHz at 600 GHz have been achieved. These devices are promising for new applications in imaging, medical diagnostics, spectroscopy and security.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, 60439, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ulrich Welp""]}, {""address"": ""Division of Materials Science, Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8573, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuo Kadowaki""]}, {""address"": ""Physikalisches Institut and Center for Collective Quantum Phenomena in LISA+, Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, D-72076, T\u00fcbingen, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Reinhold Kleiner""]}]",False,"[""Ulrich Welp"", ""Kazuo Kadowaki"", ""Reinhold Kleiner""]","Welp, U., Kadowaki, K. & Kleiner, R.

letter,Observing molecular spinning via the rotational Doppler effect,"<p>When a wave is reflected from a moving object, its frequency is Doppler shifted. Similarly, when circularly polarized light is scattered from a rotating object, a rotational Doppler frequency shift may be observed, with manifestations ranging from the quantum world (fluorescence spectroscopy, rotational Raman scattering and so on) to satellite-based global positioning systems. Here, we observe for the first time the Doppler frequency shift phenomenon for a circularly polarized light wave propagating through a gas of synchronously spinning molecules. An ensemble of such spinning molecules was produced by double-pulse laser excitation, with the first pulse aligning the molecules and the second (linearly polarized at a 45&#176; angle) causing a concerted unidirectional rotation of the &#8216;molecular propellers&#8217;. We observed the resulting rotating birefringence of the gas by detecting a Doppler-shifted wave that is circularly polarized in a sense opposite to that of the incident probe.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemical Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Omer Korech"", "",\u00a0Uri Steinitz"", "",\u00a0Ilya Sh.

letter,Brightening of excitons in carbon nanotubes on dimensionality modification,"<p>Despite the attractive one-dimensional characteristics of carbon nanotubes, their typically low luminescence quantum yield, restricted because of their one-dimensional nature, has limited the performance of nanotube-based light-emitting devices. Here, we report the striking brightening of excitons (bound electron&#8211;hole pairs) in carbon nanotubes through an artificial modification of their effective dimensionality from one dimension to zero dimensions. Exciton dynamics in carbon nanotubes with luminescent, local zero-dimension-like states generated by oxygen doping were studied as model systems. We found that the luminescence quantum yield of the excitons confined in the zero-dimension-like states can be more than at least one order larger (&#8764;18%) than that of the intrinsic one-dimensional excitons (typically &#8764;1%), not only because of the reduced non-radiative decay pathways but also due to an enhanced radiative recombination probability beyond that of intrinsic one-dimensional excitons.

letter,Off-resonant magnetization dynamics phase-locked to an intense phase-stable terahertz transient,"<p>Controlling magnetization dynamics with a femtosecond laser is attracting interest both in fundamental science and in industry because of the potential to achieve magnetic switching at ever faster speeds. Here, we report a coherent, phase-locked coupling between a high-field single-cycle terahertz transient and the magnetization of ferromagnetic cobalt films. The visualized magnetization dynamics follow the temporal terahertz field oscillation, are tightly locked to the terahertz phase and are induced in the absence of resonant excitations and energy deposition. The magnetic response occurs on the timescale of the stimulus and is thus two orders of magnitude faster than the Larmor precession response. The experimental results are excellently reproduced by the Landau&#8211;Lifshift&#8211;Gilbert semi-empirical model, indicating its applicability to ultrafast magnetization dynamics and also demonstrating the marginal effect of the co-propagating terahertz electric field. This novel phenomenon of phase-locked control of magnetization with a strong terahertz field suggests new opportunities for ultrafast data storage.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Paul Scherrer Institute, SwissFEL, Villigen PSI, 5232, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""C.

article,Terahertz polarization pulse shaping with arbitrary field control,"<p>Polarization shaping of terahertz pulses enables us to manipulate the temporal evolution of the amplitude and direction of electric-field vectors in a prescribed manner. Such arbitrary control of terahertz waves has great potential in expanding the scope of terahertz spectroscopy, the manipulation of terahertz nonlinear phenomena and coherent control. This is analogous to the use of pulse-shaping techniques for optical frequencies that involve light's polarization states as a controllable degree of freedom. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method for generating a prescribed terahertz polarization-shaped waveform by the optical rectification of a laser pulse whose instantaneous polarization state and intensity are controlled by an optical pulse shaper. We have developed a deterministic procedure to derive input parameters for the pulse shaper that are adequate to generate the desired terahertz polarization-shaped waveform, with the benefit of simple polarization selection rules for the rectification process of light waves propagating along the three-fold axis of a nonlinear optical crystal.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 2-24-16 Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo, 184-8588, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Masaaki Sato"", "",\u00a0Takayuki Suzuki"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kazuhiko Misawa""]}, {""address"": ""CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Sanbancho Bldg, 5 Sanbancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-0075, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Masaaki Sato"", "",\u00a0Takuya Higuchi"", "",\u00a0Natsuki Kanda"", "",\u00a0Kuniaki Konishi"", "",\u00a0Kosuke Yoshioka"", "",\u00a0Takayuki Suzuki"", "",\u00a0Kazuhiko Misawa"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Makoto Kuwata-Gonokami""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takuya Higuchi"", "",\u00a0Natsuki Kanda"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Makoto Kuwata-Gonokami""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takuya Higuchi"", "",\u00a0Kosuke Yoshioka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Makoto Kuwata-Gonokami""]}, {""address"": ""RIKEN Advanced Science Institute, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Natsuki Kanda""]}, {""address"": ""Photon Science Center, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Natsuki Kanda"", "",\u00a0Kuniaki Konishi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Makoto Kuwata-Gonokami""]}, {""address"": ""Interdisciplinary Research Unit in Photon-nano Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology 2-24-16 Naka-cho, Koganei, Tokyo, 184-8588, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takayuki Suzuki"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kazuhiko Misawa""]}]",False,"[""Masaaki Sato"", ""Takuya Higuchi"", ""Natsuki Kanda"", ""Kuniaki Konishi"", ""Kosuke Yoshioka"", ""Takayuki Suzuki"", ""Kazuhiko Misawa"", ""Makoto Kuwata-Gonokami""]","Sato, M., Higuchi, T., Kanda, N. et al.

article,Versatile surface plasmon resonance of carbon-dot-supported silver nanoparticles in polymer optoelectronic devices,"<p>The coupling of surface plasmons and excitons in organic materials can improve the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Here, we prepare carbon-dot-supported silver nanoparticles (CD&#8211;Ag nanoparticles) using the carbon dots both as a reducing agent and a template to fabricate solution-processable polymer light-emitting diodes and polymer solar cells. The surface plasmon resonance effect of CD&#8211;Ag nanoparticles allows significant radiative emission and additional light absorption, leading to remarkably enhanced current efficiency of 27.16&#160;cd&#160;A<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and a luminous efficiency of 18.54&#160;lm&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in polymer light-emitting diodes as well as a power conversion efficiency of 8.31% and an internal quantum efficiency of 99% in polymer solar cells compared with control devices (current efficiency&#160;=&#160;11.65&#160;cd&#160;A<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and luminous efficiency&#160;=&#160;6.33&#160;lm&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in polymer light-emitting diodes; power conversion efficiency&#160;=&#160;7.53% and internal quantum efficiency&#160;=&#160;91% in polymer solar cells).

article,"Wide-field, high-resolution Fourier ptychographic microscopy","<p>We report an imaging method, termed Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM), which iteratively stitches together a number of variably illuminated, low-resolution intensity images in Fourier space to produce a wide-field, high-resolution complex sample image. By adopting a wavefront correction strategy, the FPM method can also correct for aberrations and digitally extend a microscope's depth of focus beyond the physical limitations of its optics.As a demonstration, we built a microscope prototype with a half-pitch resolution of 0.78 &#181;m, a field of view of &#8764;120 mm<sup>2</sup> and a resolution-invariant depth of focus of 0.3&#160;mm (characterized at 632&#160;nm).

article,Compact spectrometer based on a disordered photonic chip,"<p>Light scattering in disordered media has been studied extensively due to its prevalence in natural and artificial systems. In photonics most of the research has focused on understanding and mitigating the effects of scattering, which are often detrimental. For certain applications, however, intentionally introducing disorder can actually improve device performance, as in photovoltaics. Here, we demonstrate a spectrometer based on multiple light scattering in a silicon-on-insulator chip featuring a random structure. The probe signal diffuses through the chip generating wavelength-dependent speckle patterns, which are detected and used to recover the input spectrum after calibration. A spectral resolution of 0.75&#160;nm at a wavelength of 1,500&#160;nm in a 25-&#956;m-radius structure is achieved. Such a compact, high-resolution spectrometer is well suited for lab-on-a-chip spectroscopy applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Yale University, New Haven, 06520, Connecticut, USA"", ""authors"": [""Brandon Redding"", "",\u00a0Seng Fatt Liew"", "",\u00a0Raktim Sarma"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hui Cao""]}]",False,"[""Brandon Redding"", ""Seng Fatt Liew"", ""Raktim Sarma"", ""Hui Cao""]","Redding, B., Liew, S., Sarma, R. et al.

article,High-resolution electroluminescent imaging of pressure distribution using a piezoelectric nanowire LED array,"<p>Emulation of the sensation of touch through high-resolution electronic means could become important in future generations of robotics and human&#8211;machine interfaces. Here, we demonstrate that a nanowire light-emitting diode-based pressure sensor array can map two-dimensional distributions of strain with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 2.7&#160;&#181;m, corresponding to a pixel density of 6,350&#160;dpi. Each pixel is composed of a single n-ZnO nanowire/p-GaN light-emitting diode, the emission intensity of which depends on the local strain owing to the piezo-phototronic effect. A pressure map can be created by reading out, in parallel, the electroluminescent signal from all of the pixels with a time resolution of 90&#160;ms. The device may represent a major step towards the digital imaging of mechanical signals by optical means, with potential applications in artificial skin, touchpad technology, personalized signatures, bio-imaging and optical microelectromechanical systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Materials Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, 30332-0245, Georgia, USA"", ""authors"": [""Caofeng Pan"", "",\u00a0Lin Dong"", "",\u00a0Guang Zhu"", "",\u00a0Simiao Niu"", "",\u00a0Ruomeng Yu"", "",\u00a0Qing Yang"", "",\u00a0Ying Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zhong Lin Wang""]}, {""address"": ""Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100083, China"", ""authors"": [""Caofeng Pan"", "",\u00a0Lin Dong"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zhong Lin Wang""]}]",False,"[""Caofeng Pan"", ""Lin Dong"", ""Guang Zhu"", ""Simiao Niu"", ""Ruomeng Yu"", ""Qing Yang"", ""Ying Liu"", ""Zhong Lin Wang""]","Pan, C., Dong, L., Zhu, G. et al.
