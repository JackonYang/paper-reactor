review article,Developments in laser-driven plasma accelerators,"<p>Laser-driven plasma accelerators provide acceleration gradients that are three orders of magnitude greater than those generated by conventional accelerators, offering the potential to shrink the length of accelerators by the same factor. To date, laser acceleration of electron beams to produce particle energies comparable to those offered by synchrotron light sources has been demonstrated with plasma acceleration stages that are only a few centimetres long. This Review describes the operation principles of laser-driven plasma accelerators, and gives an overview of their development from their proposal in 1979 to recent demonstrations. Potential applications of plasma accelerators are described, and the challenges that must be overcome before they can become practical tools are discussed.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK"", ""authors"": [""S.

letter,The laminar–turbulent transition in a fibre laser,"<p>Studying the transition from a linearly stable coherent laminar state to a highly disordered state of turbulence is conceptually and technically challenging, and of great interest because all pipe and channel flows are of that type. In optics, understanding how a system loses coherence, as spatial size or the strength of excitation increases, is a fundamental problem of practical importance. Here, we report our studies of a fibre laser that operates in both laminar and turbulent regimes. We show that the laminar phase is analogous to a one-dimensional coherent condensate and the onset of turbulence is due to the loss of spatial coherence. Our investigations suggest that the laminar&#8211;turbulent transition in the laser is due to condensate destruction by clustering dark and grey solitons. This finding could prove valuable for the design of coherent optical devices as well as systems operating far from thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, B4 7ET, UK"", ""authors"": [""E.

letter,Linear momentum increase and negative optical forces at dielectric interface,"<p>Light carries momenta that can be transferred to objects. Relying on gradient forces created by structured light, one can trap and move microscopic particles. Aside from the conservative action of gradient forces, light always pushes an object along its direction of propagation. Here, we demonstrate that gradientless light fields can exert pulling forces on arbitrary objects in a purely passive dielectric environment and without resorting to non-paraxial illumination, interference of multiple beams, gain or other exotic materials. The forces acting against the flow of light arise naturally due to the appropriate amplification of the photon linear momentum when light is scattered from one dielectric medium into another with higher refractive index. This situation opens up a number of intriguing prospects for optical forces and their effects on surface-bound objects. Here, we demonstrate that this new mechanism can be used to manipulate objects over macroscopic distances along dielectric interfaces.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CREOL, The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, 4000 Central Florida Boulevard, Orlando, 32816, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""Veerachart Kajorndejnukul"", "",\u00a0Sergey Sukhov"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Aristide Dogariu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, 4 Engineering Drive 3, 117576, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Weiqiang Ding"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Cheng-Wei Qiu""]}]",False,"[""Veerachart Kajorndejnukul"", ""Weiqiang Ding"", ""Sergey Sukhov"", ""Cheng-Wei Qiu"", ""Aristide Dogariu""]","Kajorndejnukul, V., Ding, W., Sukhov, S. et al.

letter,Realization of an all-dielectric zero-index optical metamaterial,"<p>Metamaterials offer unprecedented flexibility for manipulating the optical properties of matter, including the ability to access negative index, ultrahigh index and chiral optical properties. Recently, metamaterials with near-zero refractive index have attracted much attention. Light inside such materials experiences no spatial phase change and extremely large phase velocity, properties that can be applied for realizing directional emission, tunnelling waveguides, large-area single-mode devices and electromagnetic cloaks. However, at optical frequencies, the previously demonstrated zero- or negative-refractive-index metamaterials have required the use of metallic inclusions, leading to large ohmic loss, a serious impediment to device applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an impedance-matched zero-index metamaterial at optical frequencies based on purely dielectric constituents. Formed from stacked silicon-rod unit cells, the metamaterial has a nearly isotropic low-index response for transverse-magnetic polarized light, leading to angular selectivity of transmission and directive emission from quantum dots placed within the material.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Interdisciplinary Materials Science Program, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, 37212, Tennessee, USA"", ""authors"": [""Parikshit Moitra"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yuanmu Yang""]}, {""address"": ""School for Science and Math at Vanderbilt, Nashville, 37232, Tennessee, USA"", ""authors"": [""Zachary Anderson""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, 37831, Tennessee, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ivan I.

letter,Relativistic plasma nanophotonics for ultrahigh energy density physics,"<p>The heating of dense matter to extreme temperatures motivates the development of powerful lasers. However, the barrier the critical electron density imposes to light penetration into ionized materials results in the deposition of most of the laser energy into a thin surface layer at typically only 0.1% of solid density. Here, we demonstrate that trapping of femtosecond laser pulses of relativistic intensity deep within ordered nanowire arrays can volumetrically heat dense matter into a new ultrahot plasma regime. Electron densities nearly 100 times greater than the typical critical density and multi-keV temperatures are achieved using laser pulses of only 0.5&#160;J energy. We obtained extraordinarily high degrees of ionization (for example, 52 times ionized Au) and gigabar pressures only exceeded in the central hot spot of highly compressed thermonuclear fusion plasmas. Scaling to higher laser intensities promises to create plasmas with temperatures and pressures approaching those in the centre of the Sun.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, 80523, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Michael A.

letter,Miniature chiral beamsplitter based on gyroid photonic crystals,"<p>The linearly polarizing beamsplitter is a widely used optical component in photonics. It is typically built from a linearly birefringent crystal such as calcite, which has different critical reflection angles for s- and p-polarized light, leading to the transmission of one linear polarization and angled reflection of the other. However, the analogue for splitting circularly polarized light has yet to be demonstrated due to a lack of natural materials with sufficient circular birefringence. Here, we present a nano-engineered photonic-crystal chiral beamsplitter that fulfils this task. It consists of a prism featuring a nanoscale chiral gyroid network and can separate left- and right-handed circularly polarized light in the wavelength region around 1.615&#160;&#181;m. The structure is fabricated using a galvo-dithered direct laser writing method and could become a useful component for developing integrated photonic circuits that provide a new form of polarization control.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre for Micro-Photonics and CUDOS, Faculty of Engineering and Industrial Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, 3122, Victoria, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Mark D.

letter,Digitally synthesized beat frequency multiplexing for sub-millisecond fluorescence microscopy,"<p>Fluorescence imaging is the most widely used method for unveiling the molecular composition of biological specimens. However, the weak optical emission of fluorescent probes and the trade-off between imaging speed and sensitivity are problematic for acquiring blur-free images of fast phenomena, such as sub-millisecond biochemical dynamics in live cells and tissues, and cells flowing at high speed. Here, we report a technique that achieves real-time pixel readout rates that are one order of magnitude faster than a modern electron multiplier charge-coupled device&#8212;the gold standard in high-speed fluorescence imaging technology. Termed fluorescence imaging using radiofrequency-tagged emission (FIRE), this approach maps the image into the radiofrequency spectrum using the beating of digitally synthesized optical fields. We demonstrate diffraction-limited confocal fluorescence imaging of stationary cells at a frame rate of 4.4&#160;kHz, and fluorescence microscopy in flow at a velocity of 1&#160;m&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, corresponding to a throughput of approximately 50,000 cells per second.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Eric D.

article,"Ultrathin, highly flexible and stretchable PLEDs","<p>We demonstrate ultrathin (2&#160;&#181;m thick) red and orange polymer light-emitting diodes with unprecedented mechanical properties in terms of their flexibility and ability to be stretched. The devices have a luminance greater than 100&#160;cd&#160;m<sup>&#8211;2</sup>, sufficient for a variety of optoelectronic applications including indoor displays. They can be operated as free-standing ultrathin films, allowing for crumpling during device operation. Furthermore, they may be applied to almost any surface whether rigid or elastomeric, and can withstand the associated mechanical deformation. They are shown to be extremely flexible, with radii of curvature under 10&#160;&#181;m, and stretch-compatible to 100% tensile strain. Such ultrathin light-emitting foils constitute an important step towards integration with malleable materials like textiles and artificial skin.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physical Chemistry, Johannes Kepler University, Linz Institute for Organic Solar Cells (LIOS), Altenbergerstrasse 69, Linz, 4040, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Matthew S.

article,Elastomeric polymer light-emitting devices and displays,"<p>The emergence of devices that combine elasticity with electronic or optoelectronic properties offers exciting new opportunities for applications, but brings significant materials challenges. Here, we report the fabrication of an elastomeric polymer light-emitting device (EPLED) using a simple, all-solution-based process. The EPLED features a pair of transparent composite electrodes comprising a thin percolation network of silver nanowires inlaid in the surface layer. The resulting EPLED, which exhibits rubbery elasticity at room temperature, is collapsible, and can emit light when exposed to strains as large as 120%. It can also survive repeated continuous stretching cycles, and small stretching is shown to significantly enhance its light-emitting efficiency. The fabrication process is scalable and was readily adapted for the demonstration of a simple passive matrix monochrome display featuring a 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 pixel array.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jiajie Liang"", "",\u00a0Lu Li"", "",\u00a0Xiaofan Niu"", "",\u00a0Zhibin Yu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Qibing Pei""]}]",False,"[""Jiajie Liang"", ""Lu Li"", ""Xiaofan Niu"", ""Zhibin Yu"", ""Qibing Pei""]","Liang, J., Li, L., Niu, X. et al.

article,Polymer solar cells with enhanced fill factors,"<p>Recent advances in polymer solar cell (PSC) performance have resulted from compressing the bandgap to enhance the short-circuit current while lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital to increase the open-circuit voltage. Nevertheless, PSC power conversion efficiencies are still constrained by low fill factors, typically below 70%. Here, we report PSCs with exceptionally high fill factors by combining complementary materials design, synthesis, processing and device engineering strategies. The donor polymers, PTPD3T and PBTI3T, when incorporated into inverted bulk-heterojunction PSCs with a PC<sub>71</sub>BM acceptor, result in PSCs with fill factors of 76&#8211;80%. The enhanced performance is attributed to highly ordered, closely packed and properly oriented active-layer microstructures with optimal horizontal phase separation and vertical phase gradation. The result is efficient charge extraction and suppressed bulk and interfacial bimolecular recombination. The high fill factors yield power conversion efficiencies of up to 8.7% from polymers with suboptimal bandgaps, suggesting that efficiencies above 10% should be realizable by bandgap modification.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry and the Materials Research Center, the Argonne-Northwestern Solar Energy Research Center, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, 60208, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xugang Guo"", "",\u00a0Nanjia Zhou"", "",\u00a0Sylvia J.

article,Electromagnetic channel capacity for practical purposes,"<p>What is the maximum rate at which digital information can be communicated without error using electromagnetic signals, such as radio communication? According to Shannon theory this rate is the capacity of the communication channel, which is obtained by maximizing the mutual information between the channel's input and output. Shannon theory, however, has been developed within classical physics, whereas electromagnetic signals are, ultimately, quantum-mechanical entities. To account for this fact, the capacity must be expressed in terms of a complicated optimization of the Holevo information, but explicit solutions are still unknown for arguably the most elementary electromagnetic channel, the one degraded by additive thermal noise. We place bounds on the thermal channel's Holevo information that determine the capacity up to corrections that are insignificant for practical scenarios such as those with high noise or low transmissivity. Our results apply to any bosonic thermal-noise channel, including electromagnetic signalling at any frequency.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NEST, Scuola Normale Superiore and Istituto Nanoscienze-CNR, piazza dei Cavalieri 7, Pisa, I-56126, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Vittorio Giovannetti""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Seth Lloyd""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento Fisica \u2018A.
