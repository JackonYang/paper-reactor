review article,High-power fibre lasers,"<p>Fibre lasers are now associated with high average powers and very high beam qualities. Both these characteristics are required by many industrial, defence and scientific applications, which explains why fibre lasers have become one of the most popular laser technologies. However, this success, which is largely founded on the outstanding characteristics of fibres as an active medium, has only been achieved through researchers around the world striving to overcome many of the limitations imposed by the fibre architecture. This Review focuses on these limitations, both past and current, and the creative solutions that have been proposed for overcoming them. These solutions have enabled fibre lasers to generate the highest diffraction-limited average power achieved to date by solid-state lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Applied Physics, Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller-Universit\u00e4t Jena, Max-Wien-Platz 1, Jena, 07743, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Cesar Jauregui"", "",\u00a0Jens Limpert"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andreas T\u00fcnnermann""]}, {""address"": ""Helmholtz Institute Jena, Fr\u00f6belstieg 3, Jena, 07743, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Jens Limpert"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andreas T\u00fcnnermann""]}, {""address"": ""Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Albert-Einstein-Strasse 7, Jena, 07745, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Jens Limpert"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andreas T\u00fcnnermann""]}]",False,"[""Cesar Jauregui"", ""Jens Limpert"", ""Andreas T\u00fcnnermann""]","Jauregui, C., Limpert, J. & Tünnermann, A.

letter,Chip-integrated ultrafast graphene photodetector with high responsivity,"<p>Graphene-based photodetectors have attracted strong interest for their exceptional physical properties, which include an ultrafast response across a broad spectrum, a strong electron&#8211;electron interaction and photocarrier multiplication. However, the weak optical absorption of graphene limits its photoresponsivity. To address this, graphene has been integrated into nanocavities, microcavities and plasmon resonators, but these approaches restrict photodetection to narrow bands. Hybrid graphene&#8211;quantum dot architectures can greatly improve responsivity, but at the cost of response speed. Here, we demonstrate a waveguide-integrated graphene photodetector that simultaneously exhibits high responsivity, high speed and broad spectral bandwidth. Using a metal-doped graphene junction coupled evanescently to the waveguide, the detector achieves a photoresponsivity exceeding 0.1&#160;A&#160;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> together with a nearly uniform response between 1,450 and 1,590&#160;nm.

letter,High-responsivity graphene/silicon-heterostructure waveguide photodetectors,"<p>Graphene-based photonic devices, such as ultrafast photodetectors, optical modulators and tunable surface plasmon polariton devices, have experienced rapid development in recent years because they benefit greatly from graphene's strong field-controlled optical response. Here, we demonstrate a graphene/silicon-heterostructure photodiode formed by integrating graphene onto a silicon optical waveguide on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) with a near to mid-infrared operational range. The waveguide enables absorption of evanescent light that propagates parallel to the graphene sheet, which results in a responsivity as high as 0.13 A W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at a 1.5&#160;V bias for 2.75&#160;&#181;m light at room temperature. A photocurrent dependence on bias polarity was observed and attributed to two distinct mechanisms for optical absorption, that is, direct and indirect transitions in graphene at 1.55&#160;&#181;m and 2.75&#160;&#181;m, respectively.

letter,CMOS-compatible graphene photodetector covering all optical communication bands,"<p>Optical interconnects are becoming attractive alternatives to electrical wiring in intra- and interchip communication links. Particularly, the integration with silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology has received considerable interest because of the ability of cost-effective integration of electronics and optics on a single chip. Although silicon enables the realization of optical waveguides and passive components, the integration of another, optically absorbing, material is required for photodetection. Traditionally, germanium or compound semiconductors are used for this purpose; however, their integration with silicon technology faces major challenges. Recently, graphene emerged as a viable alternative for optoelectronic applications, including photodetection. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-wideband CMOS-compatible photodetector based on graphene. We achieved a multigigahertz operation over all fibre-optic telecommunication bands beyond the wavelength range of strained germanium photodetectors, the responsivity of which is limited by their bandgap. Our work complements the recent demonstration of a CMOS-integrated graphene electro-optical modulator, and paves the way for carbon-based optical interconnects.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Vienna University of Technology, Institute of Photonics, Gu\u00dfhausstra\u00dfe 27\u201329, Vienna, 1040, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Andreas Pospischil"", "",\u00a0Marco M.

letter,Nonlinear laser lithography for indefinitely large-area nanostructuring with femtosecond pulses,"<p>Dynamical systems based on the interplay of nonlinear feedback mechanisms are ubiquitous in nature. Well-understood examples from photonics include mode locking and a broad class of fractal optics, including self-similarity. In addition to the fundamental interest in such systems, fascinating technical functionalities that are difficult or even impossible to achieve with linear systems can emerge naturally from them if the right control tools can be applied. Here, we demonstrate a method that exploits positive nonlocal feedback to initiate, and negative local feedback to regulate, the growth of ultrafast laser-induced metal&#8211;oxide nanostructures with unprecedented uniformity, at high speed, low cost and on non-planar or flexible surfaces. The nonlocal nature of the feedback allows us to stitch the nanostructures seamlessly, enabling coverage of indefinitely large areas with subnanometre uniformity in periodicity.

article,Trapping light by mimicking gravitational lensing,"<p>One of the most fascinating predictions of the theory of general relativity is the effect of gravitational lensing, the bending of light in close proximity to massive stellar objects. Recently, artificial optical materials have been proposed to study the various aspects of curved spacetimes, including light trapping and Hawking radiation. However, the development of experimental &#8216;toy&#8217; models that simulate gravitational lensing in curved spacetimes remains a challenge, especially for visible light. Here, by utilizing a microstructured optical waveguide around a microsphere, we propose to mimic curved spacetimes caused by gravity, with high precision. We experimentally demonstrate both far-field gravitational lensing effects and the critical phenomenon in close proximity to the photon sphere of astrophysical objects under hydrostatic equilibrium. The proposed microstructured waveguide can be used as an omnidirectional absorber, with potential light harvesting and microcavity applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures & Department of Physics, National Center of Microstructures and Quantum Manipulation, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China"", ""authors"": [""C.

article,Experimental realization of an epsilon-near-zero metamaterial at visible wavelengths,"<p>Optical materials with a dielectric constant near zero have the unique property that light advances with almost no phase advance. Although such materials have been made artificially in the microwave and far-infrared spectral range, bulk three-dimensional epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) engineered materials in the visible spectral range have been elusive. Here, we present an optical metamaterial composed of a carefully sculpted parallel array of subwavelength silver and silicon nitride nanolamellae that shows a vanishing effective permittivity, as demonstrated by interferometry. Good impedance matching and high optical transmission are demonstrated. The ENZ condition can be tuned over the entire visible spectral range by varying the geometry, and may enable novel micro/nanooptical components, for example, transmission enhancement, wavefront shaping, controlled spontaneous emission and superradiance.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Nanophotonics, FOM Institute AMOLF, Science Park 104, Amsterdam, 1098 XG, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Ruben Maas"", "",\u00a0James Parsons"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Albert Polman""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, 200 South 33rd Street, Philadelphia, 19104-6314, Pennsylvania, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nader Engheta""]}]",False,"[""Ruben Maas"", ""James Parsons"", ""Nader Engheta"", ""Albert Polman""]","Maas, R., Parsons, J., Engheta, N. et al.

article,Two-stage seeded soft-X-ray free-electron laser,"<p>We report the first generation of coherent, tunable, variable-polarization, soft X-ray femtosecond pulses, generated by a seeded free-electron laser (FEL) operating in the fresh bunch, two-stage harmonic upshift configuration. Characterization of the radiation proves this FEL configuration can produce single-transverse-mode, narrow-spectral-bandwidth output pulses of several tens of microjoules energy and low pulse-to-pulse wavelength jitter at final wavelengths of 10.8&#160;nm and below. The fresh bunch configuration enhances the FEL emission at high harmonic orders by avoiding a gain depression due to the energy spread induced by the first-stage FEL interaction. Coherent signals measured down to 4.3&#160;nm suggest this configuration is directly scalable to photon energies that will enable scientific investigations below the carbon K-edge, including access to the L-edges of many magnetic materials, with an energy per pulse unlocking the gate for experiments in the soft X-ray region with close to Fourier-transform-limited pulses.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A. di interesse nazionale, Strada Statale 14-km 163,5 in AREA Science Park, Basovizza, 34149, Trieste, Italy"", ""authors"": [""E.

article,Real-time wavefront shaping through scattering media by all-optical feedback,"<p>Controlling light through dynamically varying heterogeneous media is a sought-after goal with important applications ranging from free-space communication to nanosurgery. The underlying challenge is to control a large number of degrees of freedom of the optical wavefront, at timescales shorter than the medium dynamics. Many advances have been reported recently following the demonstration of focusing through turbid samples by wavefront shaping, where spatial light modulators with more than 1,000&#160;degrees of freedom were used. Unfortunately, spatial light modulator-based wavefront shaping requires feedback from a detector or camera and is currently limited to slowly varying samples. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach for wavefront shaping utilizing all-optical feedback. We show that the complex wavefront required to focus light scattered by turbid samples (including thin biological tissues) can be generated at submicrosecond timescales by the process of field self-organization inside a multimode laser cavity, without requiring electronic feedback, spatial light modulators or phase-conjugation crystals.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Micha Nixon"", "",\u00a0Ori Katz"", "",\u00a0Eran Small"", "",\u00a0Yaron Bromberg"", "",\u00a0Asher A.

article,Induced transparency by coupling of Tamm and defect states in tunable terahertz plasmonic crystals,"<p>Photonic crystals and metamaterials have emerged as two classes of tailorable materials that enable the precise control of light. Plasmonic crystals, which can be thought of as photonic crystals fabricated from plasmonic materials, Bragg scatter incident electromagnetic waves from a repeated unit cell. However, plasmonic crystals, like metamaterials, are composed of subwavelength unit cells. Here, we study terahertz plasmonic crystals of several periods in a two-dimensional electron gas. This plasmonic medium is both extremely subwavelength (&#8764;&#955;/100) and reconfigurable through the application of voltages to metal electrodes. Weakly localized crystal surface states known as Tamm states are observed. By introducing an independently controlled plasmonic defect that interacts with the Tamm states, we demonstrate a frequency-agile electromagnetically induced transparency phenomenon. The observed 50% in situ tuning of the plasmonic crystal band edges should be realizable in materials such as graphene to actively control plasmonic crystal dispersion in the infrared.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87185, USA"", ""authors"": [""Gregory C.
