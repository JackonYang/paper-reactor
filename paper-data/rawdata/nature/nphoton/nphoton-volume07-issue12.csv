review article,Hyperbolic metamaterials,"<p>Electromagnetic metamaterials, artificial media created by subwavelength structuring, are useful for engineering electromagnetic space and controlling light propagation. Such materials exhibit many unusual properties that are rarely or never observed in nature. They can be employed to realize useful functionalities in emerging metadevices based on light. Here, we review hyperbolic metamaterials &#8212; one of the most unusual classes of electromagnetic metamaterials. They display hyperbolic (or indefinite) dispersion, which originates from one of the principal components of their electric or magnetic effective tensor having the opposite sign to the other two principal components. Such anisotropic structured materials exhibit distinctive properties, including strong enhancement of spontaneous emission, diverging density of states, negative refraction and enhanced superlensing effects.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Research University for Information Technology, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO), St. Petersburg, 197101, Russia"", ""authors"": [""Alexander Poddubny"", "",\u00a0Ivan Iorsh"", "",\u00a0Pavel Belov"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yuri Kivshar""]}, {""address"": ""Ioffe Physical Technical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, 194021, Russia"", ""authors"": [""Alexander Poddubny""]}, {""address"": ""Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Skolkovo, 143025, Russia"", ""authors"": [""Pavel Belov""]}, {""address"": ""Nonlinear Physics Centre and Centre for Ultrahigh-Bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems (CUDOS), Research School of Physics and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, 0200, ACT, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Yuri Kivshar""]}]",False,"[""Alexander Poddubny"", ""Ivan Iorsh"", ""Pavel Belov"", ""Yuri Kivshar""]","Poddubny, A., Iorsh, I., Belov, P. et al.

letter,Petahertz optical oscilloscope,"<p>The time-dependent field of an electromagnetic pulse can be measured if there is a fast enough gate. For terahertz radiation, femtosecond photoinjection of free carriers into a semiconductor in the presence of the terahertz radiation can serve as the gate. For visible or infrared radiation, attosecond photoionization of a gas target in the presence of the optical field is a direct analogue. Here, we show that nonlinear optical mixing in a medium in which attosecond pulses are being generated can also be used to measure the time-dependent field of an optical pulse. The gate is the phase accumulated by the recollision electron during the subcycle time interval between ionization and recombination. We show that the instantaneous field of an unknown pulse is imprinted onto the deflection of the attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulse using an all-optical set-up with a bandwidth up to 1&#160;PHz.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Joint Attosecond Science Laboratory, University of Ottawa and National Research Council, 100 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, K1A 0R6, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Kyung Taec Kim"", "",\u00a0Chunmei Zhang"", "",\u00a0Andrew D.

letter,Optically pumped room-temperature GaAs nanowire lasers,"<p>Near-infrared lasers are important for optical data communication, spectroscopy and medical diagnosis. Semiconductor nanowires offer the possibility of reducing the footprint of devices for three-dimensional device integration and hence are being extensively studied in the context of optoelectronic devices. Although visible and ultraviolet nanowire lasers have been demonstrated widely, progress towards room-temperature infrared nanowire lasers has been limited because of material quality issues and Auger recombination. (Al)GaAs is an important material system for infrared lasers that is extensively used for conventional lasers. GaAs has a very large surface recombination velocity, which is a serious issue for nanowire devices because of their large surface-to-volume ratio. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature lasing in core&#8211;shell&#8211;cap GaAs/AlGaAs/GaAs nanowires by properly designing the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity, optimizing the material quality and minimizing surface recombination.

letter,Multiphoton absorption in amyloid protein fibres,"<p>Fibrillization of peptides leads to the formation of amyloid fibres, which, when in large aggregates, are responsible for diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Here, we show that amyloids have strong nonlinear optical absorption, which is not present in native non-fibrillized protein. Z-scan and pump&#8211;probe experiments indicate that insulin and lysozyme &#946;-amyloids, as well as &#945;-synuclein fibres, exhibit either two-photon, three-photon or higher multiphoton absorption processes, depending on the wavelength of light. We propose that the enhanced multiphoton absorption is due to a cooperative mechanism involving through-space dipolar coupling between excited states of aromatic amino acids densely packed in the fibrous structures. This finding will provide the opportunity to develop nonlinear optical techniques to detect and study amyloid structures and also suggests that new protein-based materials with sizable multiphoton absorption could be designed for specific applications in nanotechnology, photonics and optoelectronics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, SE-41296, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Piotr Hanczyc"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Bengt Norden""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, 50-370, Poland"", ""authors"": [""Piotr Hanczyc"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Marek Samoc""]}]",False,"[""Piotr Hanczyc"", ""Marek Samoc"", ""Bengt Norden""]","Hanczyc, P., Samoc, M. & Norden, B.

letter,Enhanced two-photon excited fluorescence from imaging agents using true thermal light,"<p>Two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) is a standard technique in modern microscopy, but is still affected by photodamage to the probe. It has been proposed that TPEF can be enhanced using entangled photons, but this has proven challenging. Recently, it was shown that some features of entangled photons can be mimicked with thermal light, which finds application in ghost imaging, subwavelength lithography and metrology. Here, we use true thermal light from a superluminescent diode to demonstrate TPEF that is enhanced compared to coherent light, using two common fluorophores and luminescent quantum dots, which suit applications in imaging and microscopy. We find that the TPEF rate is directly proportional to the measured degree of second-order coherence, as predicted by theory. Our results show that photon bunching in thermal light can be exploited in two-photon microscopy, with the photon statistic providing a new degree of freedom.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Physics and Astronomy, Photonics, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, D-14476, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Andreas Jechow"", "",\u00a0Michael Seefeldt"", "",\u00a0Henning Kurzke"", "",\u00a0Axel Heuer"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ralf Menzel""]}]",False,"[""Andreas Jechow"", ""Michael Seefeldt"", ""Henning Kurzke"", ""Axel Heuer"", ""Ralf Menzel""]","Jechow, A., Seefeldt, M., Kurzke, H. et al.

letter,Wireless sub-THz communication system with high data rate,"<p>In communications, the frequency range 0.1&#8211;30&#160;THz is essentially terra incognita. Recently, research has focused on this terahertz gap, because the high carrier frequencies promise unprecedented channel capacities. Indeed, data rates of 100&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> were predicted for 2015. Here, we present, for the first time, a single-input and single-output wireless communication system at 237.5&#160;GHz for transmitting data over 20&#160;m at a data rate of 100&#160;Gbit&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. This breakthrough results from combining terahertz photonics and electronics, whereby a narrow-band terahertz carrier is photonically generated by mixing comb lines of a mode-locked laser in a uni-travelling-carrier photodiode. The uni-travelling-carrier photodiode output is then radiated over a beam-focusing antenna. The signal is received by a millimetre-wave monolithic integrated circuit comprising novel terahertz mixers and amplifiers. We believe that this approach provides a path to scale wireless communications to Tbit s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> rates over distances of &gt;1&#160;km.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, 76131, Germany"", ""authors"": [""S.

letter,Ultra-large-scale continuous-variable cluster states multiplexed in the time domain,"<p>Quantum computers promise ultrafast performance for certain tasks. Experimentally appealing, measurement-based quantum computation requires an entangled resource called a cluster state, with long computations requiring large cluster states. Previously, the largest cluster state consisted of eight photonic qubits or light modes, and the largest multipartite entangled state of any sort involved 14 trapped ions. These implementations involve quantum entities separated in space and, in general, each experimental apparatus is used only once. Here, we circumvent this inherent inefficiency by multiplexing light modes in the time domain. We deterministically generate and fully characterize a continuous-variable cluster state containing more than 10,000 entangled modes. This is, by three orders of magnitude, the largest entangled state created to date. The entangled modes are individually addressable wave packets of light in two beams. Furthermore, we present an efficient scheme for measurement-based quantum computation on this cluster state based on sequential applications of quantum teleportation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo, 113-8656, Bunkyo-ku, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Shota Yokoyama"", "",\u00a0Ryuji Ukai"", "",\u00a0Seiji C.

article,Light-guiding hydrogels for cell-based sensing and optogenetic synthesis in vivo,"<p>Polymer hydrogels are widely used as cell scaffolds for biomedical applications. Although the biochemical and biophysical properties of hydrogels have been investigated extensively, little attention has been paid to their potential photonic functionalities. Here, we report cell-integrated polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels for in vivo optical-sensing and therapy applications. Hydrogel patches containing cells were implanted in awake, freely moving mice for several days and shown to offer long-term transparency, biocompatibility, cell viability and light-guiding properties (loss of &lt;1&#160;dB&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>). Using optogenetic, glucagon-like peptide-1 secreting cells, we conducted light-controlled therapy using the hydrogel in a mouse model with diabetes and obtained improved glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, real-time optical readout of encapsulated heat-shock-protein-coupled fluorescent reporter cells made it possible to measure the nanotoxicity of cadmium-based bare and shelled quantum dots (CdTe; CdSe/ZnS) in vivo.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Harvard Medical School and Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, 50 Blossom Street, Boston, 02114, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Myunghwan Choi"", "",\u00a0Jin Woo Choi"", "",\u00a0Sedat Nizamoglu"", "",\u00a0Sei Kwang Hahn"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Seok Hyun Yun""]}, {""address"": ""WCU Graduate School of Nanoscience and Technology, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, 373-1 Guseong-dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Myunghwan Choi"", "",\u00a0Seonghoon Kim"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Seok Hyun Yun""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Pharmacology, Wonkwang Institute of Interfused Biomedical Science, School of Dentistry, Wonkwang University, Seoul, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Jin Woo Choi""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, 77 Cheongam-Ro, Nam-Gu, Pohang, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Sei Kwang Hahn""]}]",False,"[""Myunghwan Choi"", ""Jin Woo Choi"", ""Seonghoon Kim"", ""Sedat Nizamoglu"", ""Sei Kwang Hahn"", ""Seok Hyun Yun""]","Choi, M., Choi, J., Kim, S. et al.

article,Transparent polymer solar cells employing a layered light-trapping architecture,"<p>Organic solar cells have unique properties that make them very attractive as a renewable energy source. Of particular interest are semi-transparent cells, which have the potential to be integrated into building fa&#231;ades yet not completely block light. However, making organic cells transparent limits the metal electrode thickness to a few nanometres, drastically reducing its reflectivity and the device photon-harvesting capacity. Here, we propose and implement an ad hoc path for light-harvesting recovery to bring the photon-to-charge conversion up to almost 80% that of its opaque counterpart. We report semi-transparent PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM cells that exhibit 30% visible light transmission and 5.6% power conversion efficiency. Non-periodic photonic crystals are used to trap near-infrared and near-ultraviolet photons. By modifying the layer structure it is possible to tune the device colour without significantly altering cell performance.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, Castelldefels (Barcelona), 08860, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Rafael Betancur"", "",\u00a0Pablo Romero-Gomez"", "",\u00a0Alberto Martinez-Otero"", "",\u00a0Xavier Elias"", "",\u00a0Marc Maym\u00f3"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jordi Martorell""]}, {""address"": ""Departament de F\u00edsica i Enginyeria Nuclear, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Terrassa, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Jordi Martorell""]}]",False,"[""Rafael Betancur"", ""Pablo Romero-Gomez"", ""Alberto Martinez-Otero"", ""Xavier Elias"", ""Marc Maym\u00f3"", ""Jordi Martorell""]","Betancur, R., Romero-Gomez, P., Martinez-Otero, A. et al.

article,Imaging topological edge states in silicon photonics,"<p>Topological features&#8212;global properties not discernible locally&#8212;emerge in systems ranging from liquid crystals to magnets to fractional quantum Hall systems. A deeper understanding of the role of topology in physics has led to a new class of matter&#8212;topologically ordered systems. The best known examples are quantum Hall effects, where insensitivity to local properties manifests itself as conductance through edge states that is insensitive to defects and disorder. Current research into engineering topological order primarily focuses on analogies to quantum Hall systems, where the required magnetic field is synthesized in non-magnetic systems. Here, we realize synthetic magnetic fields for photons at room temperature, using linear silicon photonics. We observe, for the first time, topological edge states of light in a two-dimensional system and show their robustness against intrinsic and introduced disorder. Our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using photonics to realize topological order in both non-interacting and many-body regimes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Joint Quantum Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology/University of Maryland, College Park, 20742, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""M.
