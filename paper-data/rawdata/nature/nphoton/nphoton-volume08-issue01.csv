review article,Nanofocusing of electromagnetic radiation,"<p>Nanofocusing of electromagnetic radiation, that is, reducing the cross sections of propagating optical modes far beyond the diffraction limit in dielectric media, can be achieved in tapered metal&#8211;dielectric waveguides that support surface plasmon&#8211;polariton modes. Although the main principles of nanofocusing were formulated over a decade ago, a deep theoretical understanding and conclusive experimental verification were achieved only a few years ago. These advances have spawned a variety of new important technological possibilities for the efficient delivery, control and manipulation of optical radiation on the nanoscale. Here, we present the underlying physical principles of radiation nanofocusing in metallic nanostructures, overview recent progress and major developments, and consider future directions and potential applications of this subfield of nano-optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nanophotonics Pty.

letter,Nanointerferometric amplitude and phase reconstruction of tightly focused vector beams,"<p>Highly confined vectorial electromagnetic field distributions are an excellent tool for detailed studies in nano-optics, such as nonlinear microscopy, advanced fluorescence imaging or nanoplasmonics. Such field distributions can be generated, for instance, by tight focusing of polarized light beams. To guarantee high resolution in the investigation of objects with subwavelength dimensions, precise knowledge of the spatial distribution of the exciting vectorial field is of utmost importance. The full-field reconstruction methods presented to date involve, for example, complex near-field techniques. Here, we demonstrate a simple and straightforward-to-implement measurement scheme and reconstruction algorithm based on the scattering signal of a single spherical nanoparticle as a field probe. We are able to reconstruct the amplitudes and relative phases of the individual focal field components with subwavelength resolution from a single scan measurement without the need for polarization analysis of the scattered light. This scheme has the potential to improve microscopy and nanoscopy techniques.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Guenther-Scharowsky-Strasse 1/Building 24, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Thomas Bauer"", "",\u00a0Sergej Orlov"", "",\u00a0Peter Banzer"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gerd Leuchs""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Optics, Information and Photonics, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Staudtstrasse 7/B2, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Thomas Bauer"", "",\u00a0Sergej Orlov"", "",\u00a0Ulf Peschel"", "",\u00a0Peter Banzer"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gerd Leuchs""]}, {""address"": ""Cluster of Excellence \u2018Engineering of Advanced Materials\u2019, Naegelsbachstrasse 49b, Erlangen, 91052, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Ulf Peschel""]}]",False,"[""Thomas Bauer"", ""Sergej Orlov"", ""Ulf Peschel"", ""Peter Banzer"", ""Gerd Leuchs""]","Bauer, T., Orlov, S., Peschel, U. et al.

letter,Quasi-monoenergetic and tunable X-rays from a laser-driven Compton light source,"<p>The maximum achievable photon energy of compact, conventional, Compton-scattering X-ray sources is currently limited by the maximum permissible field gradient of conventional electron accelerators. An alternative compact Compton X-ray source architecture with no such limitation is based instead on a high-field-gradient laser&#8211;wakefield accelerator. In this case, a single high-power (100&#160;TW) laser system generates intense laser pulses, which are used for both electron acceleration and scattering. Although such all-laser-based sources have been demonstrated to be bright and energetic in proof-of-principle experiments, to date they have lacked several important distinguishing characteristics of conventional Compton sources. We now report the experimental demonstration of all-laser-driven Compton X-rays that are both quasi-monoenergetic (&#8764;50% full-width at half-maximum) and tunable (&#8764;70 keV to &gt;1 MeV).

letter,Tunable lifetime multiplexing using luminescent nanocrystals,"<p>Optical multiplexing plays an important role in applications such as optical data storage, document security, molecular probes and bead assays for personalized medicine. Conventional fluorescent colour coding is limited by spectral overlap and background interference, restricting the number of distinguishable identities. Here, we show that tunable luminescent lifetimes &#964; in the microsecond region can be exploited to code individual upconversion nanocrystals. In a single colour band, one can generate more than ten nanocrystal populations with distinct lifetimes ranging from 25.6&#160;&#181;s to 662.4&#160;&#181;s and decode their well-separated lifetime identities, which are independent of both colour and intensity. Such &#8216;&#964;-dots&#8217; potentially suit multichannel bioimaging, high-throughput cytometry quantification, high-density data storage, as well as security codes to combat counterfeiting.

letter,Carrier-envelope phase effects on the strong-field photoemission of electrons from metallic nanostructures,"<p>Sharp metallic nanotapers irradiated with few-cycle laser pulses are emerging as a source of highly confined coherent electron wave packets with attosecond duration and strong directivity. The possibility to steer, control or switch such electron wave packets with light is expected to pave the way towards direct visualization of nanoplasmonic field dynamics and real-time probing of electron motion in solid-state nanostructures. Such pulses can be generated by strong-field-induced tunnelling and acceleration of electrons in the near-field of sharp gold tapers within one half-cycle of the driving laser field. Here, we show the effect of the carrier-envelope phase of the laser field on the generation and motion of strong-field-emitted electrons from such tips. We observe clear variations in the width of plateau-like photoelectron spectra characteristic of the subcycle regime.

letter,Simultaneous measurement of nanoscale electric and magnetic optical fields,"<p>Control of light&#8211;matter interactions at the nanoscale has advanced fields such as quantum optics, photovoltaics and telecommunications. These advances are driven by an improved understanding of the nanoscale behaviour of light, enabled by direct observations of the local electric fields near photonic nanostructures. With the advent of metamaterials that respond to the magnetic component of light, schemes have been developed to measure the nanoscale magnetic field. However, these structures interact not only with the magnetic field, but also with the electric field of light. Here, we demonstrate the essential simultaneous detection of both electric and magnetic fields with subwavelength resolution.

letter,Photocurrent generation in semiconducting and metallic carbon nanotubes,"<p>The fundamental mechanism underlying photocurrent generation in carbon nanotubes has long been an open question. In photocurrent generation, the temperature of the photoexcited charge carriers determines the transport regime by which the electrons and holes are conducted through the nanotube. Here, we identify two different photocurrent mechanisms for metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotube devices with induced p&#8211;n junctions. Our photocurrent measurements as a function of charge carrier doping demonstrate a thermal origin for metallic nanotubes, where photo-excited hot carriers give rise to a current. For semiconducting nanotubes we demonstrate a photovoltaic mechanism, where a built-in electric field results in electron&#8211;hole separation.&#160;Our results provide an understanding of the photoresponse in carbon nanotubes, which is not only of fundamental interest but also of importance for designing carbon-based, high-efficiency photodetectors and energy-harvesting devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, Lorentzweg 1, Delft, 2628 CJ, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Maria Barkelid"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Val Zwiller""]}]",False,"[""Maria Barkelid"", ""Val Zwiller""]","Barkelid, M., Zwiller, V.

article,Laser streaking of free electrons at 25 keV,"<p>Recording electronic motion in atomic systems requires attosecond and picometre resolutions. Current attosecond technology provides photon pulses up to an energy range of 100&#160;eV, with wavelengths far too long to access structures on the atomic scale. In contrast, ultrashort free-electron pulses with sub-&#197;ngstrom de Broglie wavelengths offer the potential to resolve sub-atomic structures.

Our concept is to have an electron beam and a laser beam intersect at an ultrathin metal mirror, and potentially offers attosecond resolution. The technique will be instrumental in advancing ultrafast electron diffraction towards ever higher temporal resolution in the pursuit of the long-term goal of sub-atomic four-dimensional imaging. As a first application, we study the influence of electron&#8211;electron interactions on the characteristics of few-electron pulses.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institute of Quantum Optics, Hans-Kopfermann-Strasse 1, Garching, 85748, Germany"", ""authors"": [""F.

article,Controlling light in scattering media non-invasively using the photoacoustic transmission matrix,"<p>Optical wavefront shaping has emerged as a powerful tool for manipulating light in strongly scattering media. It enables diffraction-limited focusing and imaging at depths where conventional microscopy techniques fail. However, to date, most examples of wavefront shaping have relied on direct access to the targets or implanted probes, and the challenge is to apply it non-invasively inside complex samples. Recently, ultrasonic-tagging techniques have been utilized successfully, but these allow only small acoustically tagged volumes to be addressed at each measurement. Here, we introduce an approach that allows the non-invasive measurement of an optical transmission matrix over a large volume, inside complex samples, using a standard photoacoustic imaging set-up. We demonstrate the use of this matrix for detecting, localizing and selectively focusing light on absorbing targets through diffusive samples, as well as for extracting the scattering medium properties. Combining the transmission-matrix approach with the advantages of photoacoustic imaging opens a path towards deep-tissue imaging and light delivery utilizing endogenous optical contrast.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut Langevin, UMR7587 ESPCI ParisTech and CNRS, INSERM ERL U979, 1 Rue Jussieu, Paris, 75005, France"", ""authors"": [""T.

article,90-degree optical switching of output second-harmonic light in chiral photomagnet,"<p>Optical control of physical properties and functionalities is an attractive area of research in the development of advanced optical materials. Here, we report a magnet that can switch the polarization plane of light by 90&#176; under optical stimulation. The magnet is a chiral structured iron-octacyanoniobate, and its magnetic properties can be reversibly switched by irradiating with blue and red light, which causes light-reversible spin-crossover on the iron(II) ion. Using this material, second-harmonic generation, a nonlinear optical effect, was investigated. The vertical polarization plane was switched to horizontal polarization by irradiating with blue light, and was then returned to the original vertical polarization by irradiating with red light. This phenomenon originates from alternate optical switching between crystallographic and magnetic contributions to second-harmonic generation within the magnet, where the chiral structure and photomagnetism are coupled. The observed perpendicular optical switching should encourage studies in the fields of magneto-optical memory and optoelectronic devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Shin-ichi Ohkoshi"", "",\u00a0Shinjiro Takano"", "",\u00a0Kenta Imoto"", "",\u00a0Marie Yoshikiyo"", "",\u00a0Asuka Namai"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hiroko Tokoro""]}, {""address"": ""CREST, JST, K's Gobancho, 7 Gobancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-0076, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Shin-ichi Ohkoshi""]}, {""address"": ""NEXT, JSPS, 5-3-1 Kojimachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 102-0083, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Hiroko Tokoro""]}]",False,"[""Shin-ichi Ohkoshi"", ""Shinjiro Takano"", ""Kenta Imoto"", ""Marie Yoshikiyo"", ""Asuka Namai"", ""Hiroko Tokoro""]","Ohkoshi, S., Takano, S., Imoto, K. et al. 90-degree optical switching of output second-harmonic light in chiral photomagnet.

article,Giant Raman scattering from J-aggregated dyes inside carbon nanotubes for multispectral imaging,"<p>Raman spectroscopy uses visible light to acquire vibrational fingerprints of molecules, thus making it a powerful tool for chemical analysis in a wide range of media. However, its potential for optical imaging at high resolution is severely limited by the fact that the Raman effect is weak. Here, we report the discovery of a giant Raman scattering effect from encapsulated and aggregated dye molecules inside single-walled carbon nanotubes. Measurements performed on rod-like dyes such as &#945;-sexithiophene and &#946;-carotene, assembled inside single-walled carbon nanotubes as highly polarizable J-aggregates, indicate a resonant Raman cross-section of (3&#160;&#177;&#160;2)&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;21</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;sr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is well above the cross-section required for detecting individual aggregates at the highest optical resolution.
