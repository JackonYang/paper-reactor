review article,Plasmon-induced hot-electron generation at nanoparticle/metal-oxide interfaces for photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices,"<p>Finding higher efficiency schemes for electron&#8211;hole separation is of paramount importance for realizing more efficient conversion of solar energy in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices. Plasmonic energy conversion has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional electron&#8211;hole separation in semiconductor devices. This emerging method is based on the generation of hot electrons in plasmonic nanostructures through electromagnetic decay of surface plasmons. Here, the fundamentals of hot-electron generation, injection and regeneration are reviewed, with special attention paid to recent progress towards photovoltaic devices. This new energy-conversion method potentially offers high conversion efficiencies, while keeping fabrication costs low. However, several considerations regarding the materials, architectures and fabrication methods used need to be carefully evaluated to advance this field.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Environmental Energy Technologies Division, Plasma Applications Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""C\u00e9sar Clavero""]}]",False,"[""C\u00e9sar Clavero""]","Clavero, C.

letter,On-chip quantum interference between silicon photon-pair sources,"<p>Large-scale integrated quantum photonic technologies will require on-chip integration of identical photon sources with reconfigurable waveguide circuits. Relatively complex quantum circuits have been demonstrated already, but few studies acknowledge the pressing need to integrate photon sources and waveguide circuits together on-chip. A key step towards such large-scale quantum technologies is the integration of just two individual photon sources within a waveguide circuit, and the demonstration of high-visibility quantum interference between them. Here, we report a silicon-on-insulator device that combines two four-wave mixing sources in an interferometer with a reconfigurable phase shifter. We configured the device to create and manipulate two-colour (non-degenerate) or same-colour (degenerate) path-entangled or path-unentangled photon pairs. We observed up to 100.0&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4% visibility quantum interference on-chip, and up to 95&#160;&#177;&#160;4% off-chip. Our device removes the need for external photon sources, provides a path to increasing the complexity of quantum photonic circuits and is a first step towards fully integrated quantum technologies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""H.

letter,Wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks with ultrafast frequency combs,"<p>Highly entangled quantum networks (cluster states) lie at the heart of recent approaches to quantum computing. Yet the current approach for constructing optical quantum networks does so one node at a time, which lacks scalability. Here, we demonstrate the single-step fabrication of a multimode quantum resource from the parametric downconversion of femtosecond-frequency combs. Ultrafast pulse shaping is employed to characterize the comb's spectral entanglement. Each of the 511 possible bipartitions among ten spectral regions is shown to be entangled; furthermore, an eigenmode decomposition reveals that eight independent quantum channels (qumodes) are subsumed within the comb. This multicolour entanglement imports the classical concept of wavelength-division multiplexing to the quantum domain by playing upon frequency entanglement to enhance the capacity of quantum-information processing. The quantum frequency comb is easily addressable, robust with respect to decoherence and scalable, which renders it a unique tool for quantum information.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, 4 Place Jussieu, Paris, 75005, France"", ""authors"": [""Jonathan Roslund"", "",\u00a0Renn\u00e9 Medeiros de Ara\u00fajo"", "",\u00a0Shifeng Jiang"", "",\u00a0Claude Fabre"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Nicolas Treps""]}]",False,"[""Jonathan Roslund"", ""Renn\u00e9 Medeiros de Ara\u00fajo"", ""Shifeng Jiang"", ""Claude Fabre"", ""Nicolas Treps""]","Roslund, J., de Araújo, R., Jiang, S. et al.

The experimental implementation is realized with a quantum optical network, and the results are in full agreement with theoretical predictions (with fidelity higher than 0.978).

letter,Sub-cycle control of terahertz high-harmonic generation by dynamical Bloch oscillations,"<p>Ultrafast charge transport in strongly biased semiconductors is at the heart of high-speed electronics, electro-optics and fundamental solid-state physics. Intense light pulses in the terahertz spectral range have opened fascinating vistas. Because terahertz photon energies are far below typical electronic interband resonances, a stable electromagnetic waveform may serve as a precisely adjustable bias. Novel quantum phenomena have been anticipated for terahertz amplitudes, reaching atomic field strengths. We exploit controlled (multi-)terahertz waveforms with peak fields of 72&#160;MV&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to drive coherent interband polarization combined with dynamical Bloch oscillations in semiconducting gallium selenide. These dynamics entail the emission of phase-stable high-harmonic transients, covering the entire terahertz-to-visible spectral domain between 0.1 and 675&#160;THz. Quantum interference of different ionization paths of accelerated charge carriers is controlled via the waveform of the driving field and explained by a quantum theory of inter- and intraband dynamics.

letter,Metal-induced energy transfer for live cell nanoscopy,"<p>The discovery of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has revolutionized our ability to measure inter- and intramolecular distances on the nanometre scale using fluorescence imaging. The phenomenon is based on electromagnetic-field-mediated energy transfer from an optically excited donor to an acceptor. We replace the acceptor molecule with a metallic film and use the measured energy transfer efficiency from donor molecules to metal surface plasmons to accurately deduce the distance between the molecules and metal. Like FRET, this makes it possible to localize emitters with nanometre accuracy, but the distance range over which efficient energy transfer takes place is an order of magnitude larger than for conventional FRET. This creates a new way to localize fluorescent entities on a molecular scale, over a distance range of more than 100&#160;nm. We demonstrate the power of this method by profiling the basal lipid membrane of living cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""III.

letter,Perovskite solar cells employing organic charge-transport layers,"<p>Thin-film photovoltaics play an important role in the quest for clean renewable energy. Recently, methylammonium lead halide perovskites were identified as promising absorbers for solar cells. In the three years since, the performance of perovskite-based solar cells has improved rapidly to reach efficiencies as high as 15%. To date, all high-efficiency perovskite solar cells reported make use of a (mesoscopic) metal oxide, such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub> or ZrO<sub>2</sub>, which requires a high-temperature sintering process. Here, we show that methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layers, when sandwiched between two thin organic charge-transporting layers, also lead to solar cells with high power-conversion efficiencies (12%). To ensure a high purity, the perovskite layers were prepared by sublimation in a high-vacuum chamber. This simple planar device structure and the room-temperature deposition processes are suitable for many conducting substrates, including plastic and textiles.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Instituto de Ciencia Molecular, Universidad de Valencia, C/Catedr\u00e1tico J.

article,Perovskite solar cells with a planar heterojunction structure prepared using room-temperature solution processing techniques,"<p>Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid solar cells that combine a mesoporous scaffold, a perovskite light absorber and an organic hole transporter have emerged at the forefront of solution-processable photovoltaic devices; however, they require processing temperatures of up to 500&#160;&#176;C to sinter the mesoporous metal-oxide support. Here, we report the use of a thin film of ZnO nanoparticles as an electron-transport layer in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>-based solar cells; in contrast to mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>, the ZnO layer is both substantially thinner and requires no sintering. We took advantage of these facts to prepare flexible solar cells with power-conversion efficiencies in excess of 10%. The use of ZnO also results in improvements to device performance for cells prepared on rigid substrates. Solar cells based on this design exhibit power-conversion efficiencies as high as 15.7% when measured under AM1.5G illumination, which makes them some of the highest-performing perovskite solar cells reported to date.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, University of Saskatchewan, 110 Science Place, Saskatoon, S7N 5C9, SK, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Dianyi Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Timothy L.

article,Triplet–triplet exciton dynamics in single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are considered as building blocks for novel optoelectronic and photonic devices. Energy transport, dissipation and nonlinear optical properties of such devices depend critically on the dynamics of singlet and triplet excitons. However, little is known about triplet excitons in SWNTs despite their important role in photovoltaic, photoelectric and other applications. We present pump&#8211;probe and spin-sensitive photoluminescence studies of semiconducting SWNTs that allow the determination of the quantum yield of triplet formation (5&#160;&#177;&#160;2%), the triplet lifetime (30&#160;&#177;&#160;10&#160;&#181;s) and the triplet exciton size (0.65&#160;nm). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation is also found to induce delayed fluorescence. The power-law decay of pump&#8211;probe and time-resolved photoluminescence signals is characteristic of diffusion-limited annihilation in one-dimensional systems and allows an estimation of the triplet diffusion constant of 0.1&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. This work suggests that exciton annihilation in SWNTs is reduced by one-dimensional confinement of diffusive exciton motion.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Julius-Maximilian University W\u00fcrzburg, Am Hubland, 97074, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Dominik Stich"", "",\u00a0Florian Sp\u00e4th"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tobias Hertel""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics and Astronomy, Julius-Maximilian University W\u00fcrzburg, Am Hubland, 97074, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Hannes Kraus"", "",\u00a0Andreas Sperlich"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Vladimir Dyakonov""]}, {""address"": ""Bavarian Center for Applied Energy Research e.V.

article,Temporal solitons in optical microresonators,"<p>Temporal dissipative solitons in a continuous-wave laser-driven nonlinear optical microresonator were observed. The solitons were generated spontaneously when the laser frequency was tuned through the effective zero detuning point of a high-Q resonance, which led to an effective red-detuned pumping. Transition to soliton states were characterized by discontinuous steps in the resonator transmission. The solitons were stable in the long term and their number could be controlled via pump-laser detuning. These observations are in agreement with numerical simulations and soliton theory. Operating in the single-soliton regime allows the continuous output coupling of a femtosecond pulse train directly from the microresonator. This approach enables ultrashort pulse syntheses in spectral regimes in which broadband laser-gain media and saturable absorbers are not available. In the frequency domain the single-soliton states correspond to low-noise optical frequency combs with smooth spectral envelopes, critical to applications in broadband spectroscopy, telecommunications, astronomy and low noise microwave generation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""T.

article,Stimulated Raman scattering microscopy with a robust fibre laser source,"<p>Stimulated Raman scattering microscopy allows label-free chemical imaging and has enabled exciting applications in biology, material science and medicine. It provides a major advantage in imaging speed over spontaneous Raman scattering and has improved image contrast and spectral fidelity compared to coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. Wider adoption of the technique has, however, been hindered by the need for a costly and environmentally sensitive tunable ultrafast dual-wavelength source. We present the development of an optimized all-fibre laser system based on the optical synchronization of two picosecond power amplifiers. To circumvent the high-frequency laser noise intrinsic to amplified fibre lasers, we have further developed a high-speed noise cancellation system based on voltage-subtraction autobalanced detection. We demonstrate uncompromised imaging performance of our fibre-laser-based stimulated Raman scattering microscope with shot-noise-limited sensitivity and an imaging speed up to 1 frame&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Invenio Imaging, Inc., 1600 Adams Dr, Menlo Park, California, 94025, USA"", ""authors"": [""Christian W.
