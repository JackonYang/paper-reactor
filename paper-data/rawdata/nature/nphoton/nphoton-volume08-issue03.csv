review article,"The generation, characterization and applications of broadband isolated attosecond pulses","<p>The generation of extremely short isolated attosecond pulses requires both a broad spectral bandwidth and control of the spectral phase. Rapid progress has been made in both aspects, leading to the generation of light pulses as short as 67 as in 2012, and broadband attosecond continua covering a wide range of extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray wavelengths. Such pulses have been successfully applied in photoelectron and photoion spectroscopy and recently developed attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study electron dynamics in matter. In this Review, we discuss significant recent advances in the generation, characterization and applications of ultrabroadband, isolated attosecond pulses with spectral bandwidths comparable to the central frequency. These pulses can in principle be compressed to a single optical cycle.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CREOL and Department of Physics, Institute for the Frontier of Attosecond Science and Technology (iFAST), University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32816, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""Michael Chini"", "",\u00a0Kun Zhao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zenghu Chang""]}]",False,"[""Michael Chini"", ""Kun Zhao"", ""Zenghu Chang""]","Chini, M., Zhao, K. & Chang, Z.

review article,Manipulating quantum paths for novel attosecond measurement methods,"<p>Sources of attosecond-duration light pulses provide the fastest time resolutions available today for observing ultrafast phenomena in atoms, molecules and condensed matter. The measurement of such pulse durations is challenging because the spectrum lies in the vacuum ultraviolet or soft X-ray range. Two classes of pulse duration measurements now exist; they are classified according to whether the measurement is performed in the generating medium or in a second medium. The first measurement class is called 'in situ' and depends on gently perturbing the electron responsible for attosecond pulse formation. The second measurement class, which we refer to as 'ex situ', takes place in a second medium in which photoelectrons are produced by the attosecond pulses; a synchronized laser field perturbs the photoelectron spectrum. This Review compares and contrasts these two approaches for measuring attosecond pulses.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Joint Attosecond Science Laboratory, National Research Council and University of Ottawa, 100 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, K1A 0R6, ON, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Kyung Taec Kim"", "",\u00a0D.

review article,Attosecond molecular dynamics: fact or fiction?,"<p>The emerging application of attosecond techniques to molecular systems allows the role of electronic coherence in the control of chemical reactions to be investigated. Prompt ionization of molecules by an attosecond pulse may induce charge migration across a molecular structure on attosecond to few-femtosecond timescales, thereby possibly determining the subsequent relaxation pathways that a molecule may take. We discuss how proposals for this 'charge-directed reactivity' fit within the current understanding of quantum control and review the current state of the art of attosecond molecular science.

review article,Attosecond metrology: from electron capture to future signal processing,"<p>The accurate measurement of time lies at the heart of experimental science, and is relevant to everyday life. Extending chronoscopy to ever shorter timescales has been the key to gaining real-time insights into microscopic phenomena, ranging from vital biological processes to the dynamics underlying high technologies. The generation of isolated attosecond pulses in 2001 allowed the fastest of all motions outside the nucleus &#8212; electron dynamics in atomic systems &#8212; to be captured. Attosecond metrology has provided access to several hitherto immeasurably fast electron phenomena in atoms, molecules and solids. The fundamental importance of electron processes for the physical and life sciences, technology and medicine has rendered the young field of attosecond science one of the most dynamically expanding research fields of the new millennium. Here, we review the basic concepts underlying attosecond measurement and control techniques. Among their many potential applications, we focus on the exploration of the fundamental speed limit of electronic signal processing. This endeavour relies on ultimate-speed electron metrology, as provided by attosecond technology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Physik, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t, Am Coulombwall 1, Garching, D-85748, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Ferenc Krausz"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mark I.

letter,Solid-state light-phase detector,"<p>Attosecond science relies on the use of intense, waveform-controlled, few-cycle laser pulses to control extreme nonlinear optical processes taking place within a fraction of an optical period. A number of techniques are available for retrieving the amplitude envelope and chirp of such few-cycle laser pulses. However, their full characterization requires detection of the absolute offset between the rapidly oscillating carrier wave and the pulse envelope, the carrier&#8211;envelope phase (CEP). So far, this has only been feasible with photoelectron spectroscopy, relying on complex vacuum set-ups. Here, we present a technique that enables the detection of the CEP of few-cycle laser pulses under ambient conditions. This is based on the CEP-dependence of directly measurable electric currents generated by the electric field of light in a metal&#8211;dielectric&#8211;metal nanojunction.

letter,Spectral purity transfer between optical wavelengths at the 10−18 level,"<p>Ultrastable lasers and optical frequency combs have been the enabling technologies for the tremendous progress made in precise optical spectroscopy over the last ten years. Recently, to improve the laser frequency stabilization beyond the thermal noise fundamental limit of traditional room-temperature high-finesse optical cavities, new solutions have been developed. These are complex and often wavelength-specific, so the capability to transfer their spectral purity to any optical wavelength is therefore highly desirable. Here, we present an optical frequency comb-based scheme that transfers 4.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;16</sup> fractional frequency stability from a 1,062&#160;nm wavelength laser to a 1,542&#160;nm laser. We demonstrate that this scheme does not hinder the transfer down to 4&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;18</sup> at 1&#160;s, one order of magnitude below previously reported work with comparable systems. This exceeds, by more than one order of magnitude, the stability of any optical oscillator demonstrated to date, and satisfies the stability requirement for quantum projection noise-limited optical lattice clocks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""LNE-SYRTE, Observatoire de Paris, CNRS, UPMC, 61 avenue de l'Observatoire, Paris, 75014, France"", ""authors"": [""Daniele Nicolodi"", "",\u00a0B\u00e9reng\u00e8re Argence"", "",\u00a0Wei Zhang"", "",\u00a0Rodolphe Le Targat"", "",\u00a0Giorgio Santarelli"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yann Le Coq""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratoire Photonique, Num\u00e9rique et Nanosciences, UMR 5298 Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux 1, Institut d'Optique and CNRS, Talence, 33405, 351 Cours de la Lib\u00e9ration, France"", ""authors"": [""Giorgio Santarelli""]}]",False,"[""Daniele Nicolodi"", ""B\u00e9reng\u00e8re Argence"", ""Wei Zhang"", ""Rodolphe Le Targat"", ""Giorgio Santarelli"", ""Yann Le Coq""]","Nicolodi, D., Argence, B., Zhang, W. et al.

letter,On-demand generation of indistinguishable polarization-entangled photon pairs,"<p>An on-demand source of indistinguishable and entangled photon pairs is a fundamental component of various quantum information applications, including optical quantum computing, quantum repeaters, quantum teleportation and quantum communication. Parametric downconversion and four-wave mixing sources of entangled photons have shown high degrees of entanglement and indistinguishability, but the probabilistic nature of their generation process also creates zero or multiple photon pairs following a Poissonian distribution. This limits their use in complex algorithms where many qubits and gate operations are required. Here, we simultaneously show ultrahigh purity (g<sup>(2)</sup>(0)&#160;&lt;&#160;0.004), high entanglement fidelity (0.81&#160;&#177;&#160;0.02), high two-photon interference non-post selective visibilities (0.86&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03 and 0.71&#160;&#177;&#160;0.04) and on-demand generation (efficiency &#949;<sub>pair</sub>&#160;=&#160;0.86&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08) of polarization-entangled photon pairs from a single semiconductor quantum dot.

letter,A quantum memory for orbital angular momentum photonic qubits,"<p>Among the optical degrees of freedom, the orbital angular momentum of light provides unique properties, including mechanical torque action, which has applications for light manipulation, enhanced sensitivity in imaging techniques and potential high-density information coding for optical communication systems. Recent years have also seen a tremendous interest in exploiting orbital angular momentum at the single-photon level in quantum information technologies. In pursuing this endeavour, we demonstrate here the implementation of a quantum memory for quantum bits encoded in this optical degree of freedom. We generate various qubits with computer-controlled holograms, store and retrieve them on demand using a dynamic electromagnetically induced transparency protocol. We further analyse the retrieved states by quantum tomography and thereby demonstrate fidelities exceeding the classical benchmark, confirming the quantum functioning of our storage process.

letter,Voltage-switchable photocurrents in single-walled carbon nanotube–silicon junctions for analog and digital optoelectronics,"<p>Recent progress in silicon photonics has dramatically advanced the possible realization of heterogeneous logic circuits. A variety of Boolean optoelectronic circuits have been proposed.

To demonstrate their scalability, we fabricated a large array of photoactive elements on a centimetre-scale wafer.

article,Electrically driven subwavelength optical nanocircuits,"<p>The miniaturization of electronic and photonic device technologies has facilitated information processing and transport at ever-increasing speeds and decreasing power levels. Nanometallics or &#8216;plasmonics&#8217; has empowered us to break the diffraction limit and open the door to the development of truly nanoscale optical circuits. A logical next step in this development is the realization of compact optical sources capable of electrically driving such nanocircuits. Nanometallic lasers are a possible candidate, but the realization of power-efficient, electrically pumped nanolasers at room temperature is extremely challenging. Here, we explore a plasmonic light-emitting diode as a possible alternative option. We demonstrate that an electrically driven, nano light-emitting diode is capable of directing light emission into a single-mode plasmon waveguide with a cross-sectional area of 0.016&#955;<sup>2</sup> by exploiting the Purcell effect.

article,Unravelling the mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer processes in lead iodide perovskite solar cells,"<p>Lead halide perovskites have recently been used as light absorbers in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic solid-state solar cells, with efficiencies as high as 15% and open-circuit voltages of 1&#160;V. However, a detailed explanation of the mechanisms of operation within this photovoltaic system is still lacking. Here, we investigate the photoinduced charge transfer processes at the surface of the perovskite using time-resolved techniques. Transient laser spectroscopy and microwave photoconductivity measurements were applied to TiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mesoporous films impregnated with CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite and the organic hole-transporting material spiro-OMeTAD. We show that primary charge separation occurs at both junctions, with TiO<sub>2</sub> and the hole-transporting material, simultaneously, with ultrafast electron and hole injection taking place from the photoexcited perovskite over similar timescales. Charge recombination is shown to be significantly slower on TiO<sub>2</sub> than on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Photochemical Dynamics Group, Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Arianna Marchioro"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jacques-E.

The approach extends diffraction tomography to white-light illumination and imaging rather than scattering plane measurements.

The axial dimension of the object was reconstructed by scanning the focus through the object and acquiring a stack of phase-resolved images. We reconstructed the three-dimensional structures of live, unlabelled, red blood cells and compared the results with confocal and scanning electron microscopy images. The 350&#160;nm transverse and 900&#160;nm axial resolution achieved reveals subcellular structures at high resolution in Escherichia coli cells.
