review article,Hollow-core photonic crystal fibres for gas-based nonlinear optics,"<p>Unlike the capillaries conventionally used for gas-based spectral broadening of ultrashort (&lt;100 fs) multi-millijoule pulses, which produce only normal dispersion at usable pressure levels, hollow-core photonic crystal fibres provide pressure-adjustable normal or anomalous dispersion. They also permit low-loss guidance in a hollow channel that is about ten times narrower and has a 100-fold-higher effective nonlinearity than capillary-based systems. This has led to several dramatic results, including soliton compression to few-cycle pulses, widely tunable deep-ultraviolet light sources, novel soliton&#8211;plasma interactions and multi-octave Raman frequency combs. A new generation of versatile and efficient gas-based light sources, which are tunable from the vacuum ultraviolet to the near infrared, and of versatile and efficient pulse compression devices is emerging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Guenther-Scharowsky Strasse 1, 91058, Erlangen, Germany"", ""authors"": [""P.

letter,Broadband single-photon-level memory in a hollow-core photonic crystal fibre,"<p>Storing information encoded in light is critical for realizing optical buffers for all-optical signal processing and quantum memories for quantum information processing. These proposals require efficient interaction between atoms and a well-defined optical mode. Photonic crystal fibres can enhance light&#8211;matter interactions and have engendered a broad range of nonlinear effects; however, the storage of light has proven elusive. Here, we report the first demonstration of an optical memory in a hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. We store gigahertz-bandwidth light in the hyperfine coherence of caesium atoms at room temperature using a far-detuned Raman interaction. We demonstrate a signal-to-noise ratio of 2.6:1 at the single-photon level and a memory efficiency of 27&#160;&#177;&#160;1%. Our results demonstrate the potential of a room-temperature fibre-integrated optical memory for implementing local nodes of quantum information networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PU, UK"", ""authors"": [""M.

letter,Experimental three-photon quantum nonlocality under strict locality conditions,"<p>Quantum correlations, often observed as violations of Bell inequalities, are critical to our understanding of the quantum world, with far-reaching technological and fundamental impact. Many tests of Bell inequalities have studied pairs of correlated particles. However, interest in multi-particle quantum correlations is driving the experimental frontier to test larger systems. All violations to date require supplementary assumptions that open results to loopholes, the closing of which is one of the most important challenges in quantum science. Seminal experiments have closed some loopholes, but no experiment has closed locality loopholes with three or more particles. Here, we close both the locality and freedom-of-choice loopholes by distributing three-photon Greenberger&#8211;Horne&#8211;Zeilinger entangled states to independent observers. We measured a violation of Mermin's inequality with parameter 2.77&#160;&#177;&#160;0.08, violating its classical bound by nine standard deviations. These results are a milestone in multi-party quantum communication and a significant advancement of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Waterloo, 200 University Avenue West, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""C.

letter,Externally refuelled optical filaments,"<p>Plasma channels produced in air through femtosecond laser filamentation hold great promise for a number of applications, including remote sensing, attosecond physics and spectroscopy, channelling microwaves and lightning protection. In such settings, extended filaments are desirable, yet their longitudinal span is limited by dissipative processes. Although various techniques aiming to prolong this process have been explored, the substantial extension of optical filaments remains a challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the natural range of a plasma column can be enhanced by at least an order of magnitude when the filament is prudently accompanied by an auxiliary beam. In this arrangement, the secondary low-intensity &#8216;dressing&#8217; beam propagates linearly and acts as a distributed energy reservoir, continuously refuelling the optical filament. Our approach offers an efficient and viable route towards the generation of extended light strings in air without inducing premature wave collapse or an undesirable beam break-up into multiple filaments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""The College of Optical Sciences, The University of Arizona, 1630 East University Boulevard, Tucson, 85721, Arizona, USA"", ""authors"": [""Maik Scheller"", "",\u00a0Weibo Cheng"", "",\u00a0Jerome V.

letter,Isotropic three-dimensional super-resolution imaging with a self-bending point spread function,"<p>Airy beams maintain their intensity profiles over a large propagation distance without substantial diffraction and exhibit lateral bending during propagation. This unique property has been exploited for the micromanipulation of particles, the generation of plasma channels and the guidance of plasmonic waves, but has not been explored for high-resolution optical microscopy. Here, we introduce a self-bending point spread function (SB-PSF) based on Airy beams for three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence imaging. We designed a side-lobe-free SB-PSF and implemented a two-channel detection scheme to enable unambiguous three-dimensional localization of fluorescent molecules. The lack of diffraction and the propagation-dependent lateral bending make the SB-PSF well suited for precise three-dimensional localization of molecules over a large imaging depth. Using this method, we obtained super-resolution imaging with isotropic three-dimensional localization precision of 10&#8211;15 nm over a 3 &#181;m imaging depth from &#8764;2,000 photons per localization.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA"", ""authors"": [""Shu Jia"", "",\u00a0Joshua C.

letter,Tip-enhanced infrared nanospectroscopy via molecular expansion force detection,"<p>Mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy in the molecular fingerprint region is widely used for chemical identification and quantitative analysis employing infrared absorption spectra databases. The ability to perform mid-infrared spectroscopy with nanometre spatial resolution is highly desirable for applications in materials and life sciences. At present, scattering near-field scanning optical microscopy is considered to be the most sensitive technique for nanoscale mid-infrared spectroscopy under ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate that nanoscale mid-infrared spectra can be obtained with comparable or higher sensitivity by detecting mechanical forces exerted by molecules on the atomic force microscope tip on light excitation. The mechanical approach to mid-infrared nanospectroscopy results in a simple optical set-up that, unlike scattering near-field scanning optical microscopy, requires no cryogenically cooled mid-infrared detectors, is easy to align, and is not affected by sample scattering.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Microelectronics Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin, 10100 Burnet Road, Austin, 78758, Texas, USA"", ""authors"": [""Feng Lu"", "",\u00a0Mingzhou Jin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mikhail A.

letter,X-ray two-photon absorption competing against single and sequential multiphoton processes,"<p>The success of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has extended the frontier of nonlinear optics into the hard X-ray region. Recently, sum-frequency generation has been reported, as well as parametric downconversion. These are of the lowest (second) order, and higher-order processes remain unexplored. Here, we report the first observation of a third-order process: two-photon absorption of a 5.6&#160;keV XFEL beam by germanium. We find that two-photon absorption competes with single and sequential multiphoton processes, but we successfully determine the intrinsic cross-section by analysing the pulse-energy dependence. We also discuss the two-photon absorption cross-section by comparing a new mechanism unique to X-rays with the conventional mechanism and show that the latter is consistent with the present result. The experimental determination and understanding of the cross-section would allow two-photon absorption spectroscopy. Our result indicates that X-ray analogues of other third-order nonlinear optical processes, such as nonlinear Raman and optical Kerr effects, are available for XFEL applications in spectroscopy, imaging and beam control.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""RIKEN SPring-8 Center, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo, 679-5148, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kenji Tamasaku"", "",\u00a0Yuichi Inubushi"", "",\u00a0Kei Sawada"", "",\u00a0Makina Yabashi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tetsuya Ishikawa""]}, {""address"": ""UVSOR facility, Institute for Molecular Science, 38 Nishigo-Naka, Myodaiji-cho, Okazaki-shi, Nagoya, 444-8585, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Eiji Shigemasa""]}, {""address"": ""JASRI, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, Hyogo, 679-5198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Tetsuo Katayama"", "",\u00a0Hirokatsu Yumoto"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Haruhiko Ohashi""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Precision Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8656, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Hidekazu Mimura""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Precision Science and Technology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuto Yamauchi""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Ultra-Precision Science and Technology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuto Yamauchi""]}]",False,"[""Kenji Tamasaku"", ""Eiji Shigemasa"", ""Yuichi Inubushi"", ""Tetsuo Katayama"", ""Kei Sawada"", ""Hirokatsu Yumoto"", ""Haruhiko Ohashi"", ""Hidekazu Mimura"", ""Makina Yabashi"", ""Kazuto Yamauchi"", ""Tetsuya Ishikawa""]","Tamasaku, K., Shigemasa, E., Inubushi, Y. et al.X-ray two-photon absorption competing against single and sequential multiphoton processes.

letter,Two-plasmon quantum interference,"<p>Surface plasma waves on metals arise from the collective oscillation of many free electrons in unison. These waves are usually quantized by direct analogy to electromagnetic fields in free space, with the surface plasmon, the quantum of the surface plasma wave, playing the same role as the photon. It follows that surface plasmons should exhibit all the same quantum phenomena that photons do. Here, we report a plasmonic version of the Hong&#8211;Ou&#8211;Mandel experiment, in which we observe unambiguous two-photon quantum interference between plasmons, confirming that surface plasmons faithfully reproduce this effect with the same visibility and mutual coherence time, to within measurement error, as in the photonic case. These properties are important if plasmonic devices are to be employed in quantum information applications, which typically require indistinguishable particles.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Kavli Nanoscience Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, 91125, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""James S.

letter,Optomechanical self-structuring in a cold atomic gas,"<p>The rapidly developing field of optomechanics aims at the combined control of optical and mechanical modes. In cold atoms, the spontaneous emergence of spatial structures due to optomechanical back-action has been observed in one dimension in optical cavities or highly anisotropic samples. Extensions to higher dimensions that aim to exploit multimode configurations have been suggested theoretically. Here, we describe a simple experiment with many spatial degrees of freedom, in which two continuous symmetries&#8212;rotation and translation in the plane orthogonal to a pump beam axis&#8212;are spontaneously broken. We observe the simultaneous long-range spatial structuring (with hexagonal symmetry) of the density of a cold atomic cloud and of the pump optical field, with adjustable length scale. Being based on coherent phenomena (diffraction and the dipole force), this scheme can potentially be extended to quantum degenerate gases.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut Non Lin\u00e9aire de Nice, UMR 7335 CNRS, 1361 route des Lucioles, Valbonne, 06560, France"", ""authors"": [""G.

article,Efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence,"<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have emerged as cheaper alternatives to high-performance phosphorescent OLEDs with noble-metal-based dopants. However, the efficiencies of blue TADF OLEDs are still low at high luminance, limiting full-colour display. Here, we report a blue OLED containing a 9,10-dihydroacridine/diphenylsulphone derivative that has a comparable performance to today's best phosphorescent OLEDs. The device offers an external quantum efficiency of 19.5% and reduced efficiency roll-off characteristics at high luminance. Through computational simulation, we identified six pretwisted intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) molecules with small singlet&#8211;triplet CT state splitting but different energy relationships between <sup>3</sup>CT and locally excited triplet (<sup>3</sup>LE) states. Systematic comparison of their excited-state dynamics revealed that CT molecules with a large twist angle can emit efficient and short-lifetime (a few microseconds) TADF when the emission peak energy is high enough and the <sup>3</sup>LE state is higher than the <sup>3</sup>CT state.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics Research (OPERA), Kyushu University, 744 Motooka, Nishi-ku, 819-0395, Fukuoka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Qisheng Zhang"", "",\u00a0Bo Li"", "",\u00a0Shuping Huang"", "",\u00a0Hiroko Nomura"", "",\u00a0Hiroyuki Tanaka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Chihaya Adachi""]}, {""address"": ""International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research, Kyushu University, 744 Motooka, Nishi-ku, 819-0395, Fukuoka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Chihaya Adachi""]}]",False,"[""Qisheng Zhang"", ""Bo Li"", ""Shuping Huang"", ""Hiroko Nomura"", ""Hiroyuki Tanaka"", ""Chihaya Adachi""]","Zhang, Q., Li, B., Huang, S. et al.

article,Measurement-based noiseless linear amplification for quantum communication,"<p>Entanglement distillation is an indispensable ingredient in extended quantum communication networks. Distillation protocols are necessarily non-deterministic and require advanced experimental techniques such as noiseless amplification. Recently, it was shown that the benefits of noiseless amplification could be extracted by performing a post-selective filtering of the measurement record to improve the performance of quantum key distribution. We apply this protocol to entanglement degraded by transmission loss of up to the equivalent of 100&#160;km of optical fibre. We measure an effective entangled resource stronger than that achievable by even a maximally entangled resource passively transmitted through the same channel. We also provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of secret key extraction from an otherwise insecure regime. The measurement-based noiseless linear amplifier offers two advantages over its physical counterpart: ease of implementation and near-optimal probability of success. It should provide an effective and versatile tool for a broad class of entanglement-based quantum communication protocols.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Quantum Science, Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Helen M.
