article,The influence of molecular orientation on organic bulk heterojunction solar cells,"<p>In bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics, electron-donating and electron-accepting materials form a distributed network of heterointerfaces in the photoactive layer, where critical photo-physical processes occur. However, little is known about the structural properties of these interfaces due to their complex three-dimensional arrangement and the lack of techniques to measure local order. Here, we report that molecular orientation relative to donor/acceptor heterojunctions is an important parameter in realizing high-performance fullerene-based, bulk heterojunction solar cells. Using resonant soft X-ray scattering, we characterize the degree of molecular orientation, an order parameter that describes face-on (+1) or edge-on (&#8722;1) orientations relative to these heterointerfaces. By manipulating the degree of molecular orientation through the choice of molecular chemistry and the characteristics of the processing solvent, we are able to show the importance of this structural parameter on the performance of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices featuring the electron-donating polymers PNDT&#8211;DTBT, PBnDT&#8211;DTBT or PBnDT&#8211;TAZ.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, 27695, North Carolina, USA"", ""authors"": [""John R.

article,Large-area luminescent solar concentrators based on 'Stokes-shift-engineered' nanocrystals in a mass-polymerized PMMA matrix,"<p>Luminescent solar concentrators are cost-effective complements to semiconductor photovoltaics that can boost the output of solar cells and allow for the integration of photovoltaic-active architectural elements into buildings (for example, photovoltaic windows). Colloidal quantum dots are attractive for use in luminescent solar concentrators, but their small Stokes shift results in reabsorption losses that hinder the realization of large-area devices. Here, we use &#8216;Stokes-shift-engineered&#8217; CdSe/CdS quantum dots with giant shells (giant quantum dots) to realize luminescent solar concentrators without reabsorption losses for device dimensions up to tens of centimetres. Monte-Carlo simulations show a 100-fold increase in efficiency using giant quantum dots compared with core-only nanocrystals. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by using high-optical-quality quantum dot&#8211;polymethylmethacrylate nanocomposites fabricated using a modified industrial method that preserves the light-emitting properties of giant quantum dots upon incorporation into the polymer. Study of these luminescent solar concentrators yields optical efficiencies &gt;10% and an effective concentration factor of 4.4. These results demonstrate the significant promise of Stokes-shift-engineered quantum dots for large-area luminescent solar concentrators.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Dipartimento di Scienza dei Materiali, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, via Cozzi 55, Milano, I-20125, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Francesco Meinardi"", "",\u00a0Annalisa Colombo"", "",\u00a0Roberto Simonutti"", "",\u00a0Monica Lorenzon"", "",\u00a0Luca Beverina"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sergio Brovelli""]}, {""address"": ""Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, 87545, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kirill A.

article,Shape-induced force fields in optical trapping,"<p>Advances in optical tweezers, coupled with the proliferation of two-photon polymerization systems, mean that it is now becoming routine to fabricate and trap non-spherical particles. The shaping of both light beams and particles allows fine control over the flow of momentum from the optical to mechanical regimes. However, understanding and predicting the behaviour of such systems is highly complex in comparison with the traditional optically trapped microsphere. In this Article, we present a conceptually new and simple approach based on the nature of the optical force density. We illustrate the method through the design and fabrication of a shaped particle capable of acting as a passive force clamp, and we demonstrate its use as an optically trapped probe for imaging surface topography. Further applications of the design rules highlighted here may lead to new sensors for probing biomolecule mechanics, as well as to the development of optically actuated micromachines.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""H.H.

article,"Watt-class high-power, high-beam-quality photonic-crystal lasers","<p>The applications of surface-emitting lasers, in particular vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), are currently being extended to various low-power fields including communications and interconnections. However, the fundamental difficulties in increasing their output power by more than several milliwatts while maintaining single-mode operation prevent their application in high-power fields such as material processing, laser medicine and nonlinear optics, despite their advantageous properties of circular beams, the absence of catastrophic optical damage, and their suitability for two-dimensional integration. Here, we demonstrate watt-class high-power, single-mode operation by a two-dimensional photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser under room-temperature, continuous-wave conditions. The two-dimensional band-edge resonant effect of a photonic crystal formed by metal&#8211;organic chemical vapour deposition enables a 1,000 times broader coherent-oscillation area, which results in a high beam quality of M<sup>2</sup>&#160;&#8804;&#160;1.1, narrowing the focus spot by two orders of magnitude compared to VCSELs. Our demonstration promises to realize innovative high-power applications for surface-emitting lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Material Research Group, Central Research Laboratory, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Shizuoka, 434-8601, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuyoshi Hirose"", "",\u00a0Yoshitaka Kurosaka"", "",\u00a0Akiyoshi Watanabe"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Takahiro Sugiyama""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuyoshi Hirose"", "",\u00a0Yong Liang"", "",\u00a0Yoshitaka Kurosaka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Susumu Noda""]}, {""address"": ""JST ACCEL, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 615-8510, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Susumu Noda""]}]",False,"[""Kazuyoshi Hirose"", ""Yong Liang"", ""Yoshitaka Kurosaka"", ""Akiyoshi Watanabe"", ""Takahiro Sugiyama"", ""Susumu Noda""]","Hirose, K., Liang, Y., Kurosaka, Y. et al.

article,Tunable hot-carrier photodetection beyond the bandgap spectral limit,"<p>The spectral response of common optoelectronic photodetectors is restricted by a cutoff wavelength limit &#955;<sub>c</sub> that is related to the activation energy (or bandgap) of the semiconductor structure (or material) (&#916;) through the relationship &#955;<sub>c</sub>&#160;=&#160;hc/&#916;. This spectral rule dominates device design and intrinsically limits the long-wavelength response of a semiconductor photodetector. Here, we report a new, long-wavelength photodetection principle based on a hot&#8211;cold hole energy transfer mechanism that overcomes this spectral limit. Hot carriers injected into a semiconductor structure interact with cold carriers and excite them to higher energy states. This enables a very long-wavelength infrared response. In our experiments, we observe a response up to 55&#160;&#181;m, which is tunable by varying the degree of hot-hole injection, for a GaAs/AlGaAs sample with &#916;&#160;=&#160;0.32&#160;eV (equivalent to 3.9&#160;&#181;m in wavelength).</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University, Atlanta, 30303, Georgia, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yan-Feng Lao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0A.
