article,Cavity-stimulated Raman emission from a single quantum dot spin,"<p>Solid-state quantum emitters have shown strong potential for applications in quantum information, but the spectral inhomogeneity of these emitters poses a significant challenge. We address this issue in a cavity&#8211;quantum dot system by demonstrating cavity-stimulated Raman spin flip emission. This process avoids populating the excited state of the emitter and generates a photon that is Raman shifted from the laser and enhanced by the cavity. The emission is spectrally narrow and tunable over a range of at least 125&#160;GHz, which is two orders of magnitude greater than the natural linewidth. We obtain the regime in which the Raman emission is spin dependent, which couples the photon to a long-lived electron spin qubit. This process can enable an efficient, tunable source of indistinguishable photons and deterministic entanglement of distant spin qubits in a photonic-crystal quantum network.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, 20375, DC, USA"", ""authors"": [""Timothy M.

article,Mapping distributed brain function and networks with diffuse optical tomography,"<p>Mapping of human brain function has revolutionized systems neuroscience. However, traditional functional neuroimaging by positron emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging cannot be used when applications require portability, or are contraindicated because of ionizing radiation (positron emission tomography) or implanted metal (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Optical neuroimaging offers a non-invasive alternative that is radiation free and compatible with implanted metal and electronic devices (for example, pacemakers). However, optical imaging technology has heretofore lacked the combination of spatial resolution and wide field of view sufficient to map distributed brain functions. Here, we present a high-density diffuse optical tomography imaging array that can map higher-order, distributed brain function. The system was tested by imaging four hierarchical language tasks and multiple resting-state networks including the dorsal attention and default mode networks. Finally, we imaged brain function in patients with Parkinson's disease and implanted deep brain stimulators that preclude functional magnetic resonance imaging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, 63110, Missouri, USA"", ""authors"": [""Adam T.

article,Photodynamic therapy by in situ nonlinear photon conversion,"<p>In photodynamic therapy, light is absorbed by a therapy agent (photosensitizer) to generate reactive oxygen, which then locally kills diseased cells. Here, we report a new form of photodynamic therapy in which nonlinear optical interactions of near-infrared laser radiation with a biological medium in situ produce light that falls within the absorption band of the photosensitizer. The use of near-infrared radiation, followed by upconversion to visible or ultraviolet light, provides deep tissue penetration, thus overcoming a major hurdle in treatment. By modelling and experiment, we demonstrate activation of a known photosensitizer, chlorin e6, by in situ nonlinear optical upconversion of near-infrared laser radiation using second-harmonic generation in collagen and four-wave mixing, including coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, produced by cellular biomolecules. The introduction of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering/four-wave mixing to photodynamic therapy in vitro increases the efficiency by a factor of two compared to two-photon photodynamic therapy alone, while second-harmonic generation provides a fivefold increase.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Photonics and Biophotonics and the Department of Chemistry, Institute for Lasers, The University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, 14260, USA"", ""authors"": [""A.

article,Terahertz laser frequency combs,"<p>Terahertz light can be used to identify numerous complex molecules, but has traditionally remained unexploited due to the lack of powerful broadband sources. Pulsed lasers can be used to generate broadband radiation, but such sources are bulky and produce only microwatts of average power. Conversely, although terahertz quantum cascade lasers are compact semiconductor sources of high-power terahertz radiation, their narrowband emission makes them unsuitable for complex spectroscopy. In this work, we demonstrate frequency combs based on terahertz quantum cascade lasers, which combine the high power of lasers with the broadband capabilities of pulsed sources. By fully exploiting the quantum-mechanically broadened gain spectrum available to these lasers, we can generate 5&#160;mW of terahertz power spread across 70 laser lines. This radiation is sufficiently powerful to be detected by Schottky-diode mixers, and will lead to compact terahertz spectrometers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""David Burghoff"", "",\u00a0Tsung-Yu Kao"", "",\u00a0Ningren Han"", "",\u00a0Chun Wang Ivan Chan"", "",\u00a0Xiaowei Cai"", "",\u00a0Yang Yang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Qing Hu""]}, {""address"": ""SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research, Groningen, 9747 AD, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Darren J.

article,"Comparative analysis of spasers, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers and surface-plasmon-emitting diodes","<p>Electrically pumped subwavelength plasmonic lasers (spasers) have attracted significant interest in recent years, but their properties are still not well understood, especially in comparison to the ubiquitous all-dielectric semiconductor microlasers (vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, VCSELs). Our theoretical analysis reveals that, from the fundamental physics point of view, a spaser does not differ from a semiconductor laser, as most of the energy is contained in the oscillations of electrons (free versus bound) and not in the electromagnetic field. At the same time, due to large losses in the metal, the technical characteristics of a spaser differ significantly from the VCSEL in that the spaser has at least three orders of magnitude higher threshold current density, four to five orders of magnitude wider linewidth, and a speed that is only a few times higher than in a VCSEL or an incoherent surface-plasmon-emitting diode. These results should assist researchers in making an informed choice of emitters for various particular optoelectronic applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 21218, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jacob B.

article,Large-scale integration of wavelength-addressable all-optical memories on a photonic crystal chip,"<p>Photonic integration has long been pursued, but remains immature compared with electronics. Nanophotonics is expected to change this situation. However, despite the recent success of nanophotonic devices, there has been no demonstration of large-scale integration. Here, we describe the large-scale and dense integration of optical memories in a photonic crystal chip. To achieve this, we introduce a wavelength-addressable serial integration scheme using a simple cavity-optimization rule. We fully exploit the wavelength-division-multiplexing capability, which is the most important advantage of photonics over electronics, and achieve an extremely large wavelength-channel density. This is the first demonstration of the large-scale photonic integration of nanophotonic devices coupled to waveguides in a single chip, and also the first dense wavelength-division-multiplexing nanophotonic devices other than filters. This work paves the way for optical random-access memories and for a large-scale wavelength-division-multiplexing photonic network-on-chip.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Nanophotonics Center, NTT Corp., 3-1 Morinosato-Wakamiya, Atsugi, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Eiichi Kuramochi"", "",\u00a0Kengo Nozaki"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Koji Takeda"", "",\u00a0Tomonari Sato"", "",\u00a0Shinji Matsuo"", "",\u00a0Hideaki Taniyama"", "",\u00a0Hisashi Sumikura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corp., 3-1 Morinosato-Wakamiya, Atsugi, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Eiichi Kuramochi"", "",\u00a0Kengo Nozaki"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Hideaki Taniyama"", "",\u00a0Hisashi Sumikura"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Photonics Laboratories, NTT Corp., 3-1 Morinosato-Wakamiya, Atsugi, 243-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Koji Takeda"", "",\u00a0Tomonari Sato"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shinji Matsuo""]}]",False,"[""Eiichi Kuramochi"", ""Kengo Nozaki"", ""Akihiko Shinya"", ""Koji Takeda"", ""Tomonari Sato"", ""Shinji Matsuo"", ""Hideaki Taniyama"", ""Hisashi Sumikura"", ""Masaya Notomi""]","Kuramochi, E., Nozaki, K., Shinya, A. et al.

article,Integrated germanium optical interconnects on silicon substrates,"<p>Monolithic integration of optoelectronics with electronics is a much-desired functionality. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to realize low-loss Ge quantum-well photonic interconnects on Si wafers. We show that Ge-rich Si<sub>1&#8211;</sub><sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>x</sub> virtual substrates can act as a passive, high-quality optical waveguide on which low-temperature, epitaxial growth of Ge quantum-well devices can be realized. As a proof of concept, the photonic integration of a passive Si<sub>0.16</sub>Ge<sub>0.84</sub> waveguide and two Ge/SiGe multi-quantum-well active devices, an optical modulator and a photodetector was realized to form a photonic interconnect using a single epitaxial growth step. This demonstration confirms that Ge quantum-well interconnects are feasible for low-voltage, broadband optical links integrated on Si chips. Our approach can be extended to any kind of Ge-based optoelectronic device working within telecommunication wavelengths as long as a suitable Ge concentration is selected for the Ge-rich virtual substrate.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut d'Electronique Fondamentale, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, CNRS UMR 8622, B\u00e2timent 220, Orsay Cedex, 91405, France"", ""authors"": [""Papichaya Chaisakul"", "",\u00a0Delphine Marris-Morini"", "",\u00a0Mohamed-Said Rouifed"", "",\u00a0Paul Crozat"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Laurent Vivien""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica del Politecnico di Milano, L-NESS, Polo di Como, Via Anzani 42, Como, I-22100, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Jacopo Frigerio"", "",\u00a0Daniel Chrastina"", "",\u00a0Stefano Cecchi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Giovanni Isella""]}]",False,"[""Papichaya Chaisakul"", ""Delphine Marris-Morini"", ""Jacopo Frigerio"", ""Daniel Chrastina"", ""Mohamed-Said Rouifed"", ""Stefano Cecchi"", ""Paul Crozat"", ""Giovanni Isella"", ""Laurent Vivien""]","Chaisakul, P., Marris-Morini, D., Frigerio, J. et al.

article,Lead-free solid-state organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells,"<p>Lead-free solution-processed solid-state photovoltaic devices based on methylammonium tin iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>SnI<sub>3</sub>) perovskite semiconductor as the light harvester are reported. Featuring an optical bandgap of 1.3&#160;eV, the CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>SnI<sub>3</sub> perovskite material can be incorporated into devices with the organic hole-transport layer spiro-OMeTAD and show an absorption onset at 950&#160;nm, which is significantly redshifted compared with the benchmark CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> counterpart (1.55&#160;eV). Bandgap engineering was implemented by chemical substitution in the form of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>SnI<sub>3&#8211;x</sub>Br<sub>x</sub> solid solutions, which can be controllably tuned to cover much of the visible spectrum, thus enabling the realization of lead-free solar cells with an initial power conversion efficiency of 5.73% under simulated full sunlight. Further efficiency enhancements are expected following optimization and a better fundamental understanding of the internal electron dynamics and corresponding interfacial engineering. The reported CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>SnI<sub>3&#8211;x</sub>Br<sub>x</sub> perovskite solar cells represent a step towards the realization of low-cost, environmentally friendly solid-state solar cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, 60208, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Feng Hao"", "",\u00a0Constantinos C.
