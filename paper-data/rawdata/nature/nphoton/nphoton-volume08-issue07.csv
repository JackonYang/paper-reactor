article,Extreme ultraviolet radiation with coherence time greater than 1 s,"<p>Many atomic and molecular systems of fundamental interest possess resonance frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) where laser technology is limited and radiation sources have traditionally lacked long-term phase coherence. Recent breakthroughs in XUV frequency comb technology have demonstrated spectroscopy with unprecedented resolution at the megahertz level, but even higher resolutions are desired for future applications in precision measurement. By characterizing heterodyne beats between two XUV comb sources, we demonstrate the capability for sub-hertz spectral resolution. This corresponds to coherence times &gt;1&#160;s at photon energies up to 20&#160;eV, more than six orders of magnitude longer than previously reported. This work establishes the ability of creating highly phase-stable radiation in the XUV with performance rivalling that of visible light. Furthermore, by direct sampling of the phase of the XUV light originating from high-harmonic generation, we demonstrate precise measurements of attosecond strong-field physics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""JILA, National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado, Boulder, 80309-0440, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Craig Benko"", "",\u00a0Thomas K.

article,Efficient real-time detection of terahertz pulse radiation based on photoacoustic conversion by carbon nanotube nanocomposite,"<p>Terahertz sensing plays an important role in industry, biology and material science. Most existing techniques for terahertz detection either require bulky optics or need cryogenic cooling, and the uncooled thermal detectors usually suffer from long integration times (1&#8211;1,000 ms). We propose, and experimentally demonstrate, a novel scheme based on photoacoustic detection of terahertz pulse radiation. The transient and localized heating in a carbon nanotube&#8211;polymer composite by the absorption of terahertz pulse energy produces ultrasound, which is subsequently detected by a highly sensitive acoustic sensor. In contrast to conventional thermal detectors utilizing continuous heat integration, this new method of terahertz detection responds to the energy of each individual terahertz pulse by a time-gated scheme, thus rejecting the continuous radiation from the ambient. In addition, this novel detector possesses advantages such as room-temperature operation, a fast response (&#8764;0.1 &#181;s) allowing real-time detection, compact size (millimetre scale) and wide spectral response.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, Michigan, USA"", ""authors"": [""Sung-Liang Chen"", "",\u00a0Cheng Zhang"", "",\u00a0Tao Ling"", "",\u00a0Momchil T.

article,Spin angular momentum and tunable polarization in high-harmonic generation,"<p>The roles of energy, momentum and orbital angular momentum conservation in high-harmonic generation were studied in the past. Here, we explore the role of spin angular momentum in high-harmonic generation by experimentally generating high harmonics of bichromatic elliptically polarized pump beams that interact with isotropic media. We explain qualitatively many observed intricate selection rules with a model that includes spin conservation in the conversion of many pump photons into a single photon. However, we also observe unequivocal deviations from this model, indicating that emission of an elliptically polarized high-energy photon is accompanied by an additional excitation (radiative or electronic). The presented results are also important for applications, because our system exhibits full control over the polarization of the harmonics, from circular through elliptical to linear polarization, without compromising the efficiency of the process. This work paves the way for a broad range of applications with high-harmonic generation, including ultrafast circular dichroism of molecules and magnetic materials.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Solid State Institute and Physics Department, Technion, Haifa, 32000, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Avner Fleischer"", "",\u00a0Ofer Kfir"", "",\u00a0Tzvi Diskin"", "",\u00a0Pavel Sidorenko"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Oren Cohen""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics and Optical Engineering, Ort Braude College, Karmiel, 21982, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Avner Fleischer""]}]",False,"[""Avner Fleischer"", ""Ofer Kfir"", ""Tzvi Diskin"", ""Pavel Sidorenko"", ""Oren Cohen""]","Fleischer, A., Kfir, O., Diskin, T. et al.

article,Emitters of N-photon bundles,"<p>Controlling the output of a light emitter is one of the basic tasks in photonics, with landmarks such as the development of the laser and single-photon sources. The ever growing range of quantum applications is making it increasingly important to diversify the available quantum sources. Here, we propose a cavity quantum electrodynamics scheme to realize emitters that release their energy in groups (or &#8216;bundles&#8217;) of N photons (where N is an integer). Close to 100% of two-photon emission and 90% of three-photon emission is shown to be within reach of state-of-the-art samples. The emission can be tuned with the system parameters so that the device behaves as a laser or as an N-photon gun. Here, we develop the theoretical formalism to characterize such emitters, with the bundle statistics arising as an extension of the fundamental correlation functions of quantum optics.

article,Fundamental limits and near-optimal design of graphene modulators and non-reciprocal devices,"<p>The potential of graphene for photonic applications was evidenced by recent demonstrations of modulators, polarization rotators and isolators. These promising yet preliminary results raise crucial questions: what is the optimal performance achievable by more complex designs and how can this optimum be achieved in practice? We answer by first demonstrating that the relevant figures of merit for the devices above are subject to absolute theoretical upper bounds. Strikingly, these limits are related only to the conductivity tensor of graphene; thus, we can provide essential roadmap information such as the best possible device performance versus wavelength and graphene quality. Second, based on the theory developed, physical insight and detailed simulations, we demonstrate how structures closely approaching these fundamental limits can be designed, demonstrating the possibility of significant improvement. These results are believed to be of paramount importance for the design of modulators, rotators and isolators using graphene or other two-dimensional materials.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Adaptive MicroNano Wave Systems, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Michele Tamagnone"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Julien Perruisseau-Carrier""]}, {""address"": ""DESY-Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL), Notkestrasse 85, Hamburg, D-22607, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Arya Fallahi""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratory of Electromagnetics and Acoustics (LEMA), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, 1015, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Juan R.

article,Generation of hybrid entanglement of light,"<p>Entanglement between quantum and classical objects is of special interest in the context of fundamental studies of quantum mechanics and potential applications for quantum information processing. In quantum optics, single photons are treated as light quanta while coherent states are considered the most classical of pure states. Recently, entanglement between a single photon and a coherent state in a free-travelling field was identified as a useful resource for optical quantum information processing. However, the extreme difficulty involved in generating such states was highlighted, as it requires clean cross-Kerr nonlinearities. Here, we devise and experimentally demonstrate a scheme to generate such hybrid entanglement by implementing a superposition of two distinct quantum operations. The generated states clearly show entanglement between the two different types of states. Our work opens the way to the generation of hybrid entanglement of greater size and the development of efficient quantum information processing using a new type of qubit.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Center for Macroscopic Quantum Control, Seoul National University, Seoul, 151-742, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Hyunseok Jeong"", "",\u00a0Minsu Kang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Seung-Woo Lee""]}, {""address"": ""Istituto Nazionale di Ottica (INO-CNR), Largo Enrico Fermi 6, Florence, 50125, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Alessandro Zavatta"", "",\u00a0Luca S.

article,Remote creation of hybrid entanglement between particle-like and wave-like optical qubits,"<p>The wave&#8211;particle duality of light has led to two different encodings for optical quantum information processing. Several approaches have emerged based either on particle-like discrete-variable states (that is, finite-dimensional quantum systems) or on wave-like continuous-variable states (that is, infinite-dimensional systems). Here, we demonstrate the generation of entanglement between optical qubits of these different types, located at distant places and connected by a lossy channel. Such hybrid entanglement, which is a key resource for a variety of recently proposed schemes, including quantum cryptography and computing, enables information to be converted from one Hilbert space to the other via teleportation and therefore the connection of remote quantum processors based upon different encodings. Beyond its fundamental significance for the exploration of entanglement and its possible instantiations, our optical circuit holds promise for implementations of heterogeneous network, where discrete- and continuous-variable operations and techniques can be efficiently combined.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, CNRS, 4 place Jussieu, Paris Cedex 05, 75252, France"", ""authors"": [""Olivier Morin"", "",\u00a0Kun Huang"", "",\u00a0Jianli Liu"", "",\u00a0Hanna Le Jeannic"", "",\u00a0Claude Fabre"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Julien Laurat""]}, {""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200062, China"", ""authors"": [""Kun Huang""]}]",False,"[""Olivier Morin"", ""Kun Huang"", ""Jianli Liu"", ""Hanna Le Jeannic"", ""Claude Fabre"", ""Julien Laurat""]","Morin, O., Huang, K., Liu, J. et al.
