article,On the experimental verification of quantum complexity in linear optics,"<p>Quantum computers promise to solve certain problems that are forever intractable to classical computers. The first of these devices are likely to tackle bespoke problems suited to their own particular physical capabilities. Sampling the probability distribution from many bosons interfering quantum-mechanically is conjectured to be intractable to a classical computer but solvable with photons in linear optics. However, the complexity of this type of problem means its solution is mathematically unverifiable, so the task of establishing successful operation becomes one of gathering sufficiently convincing circumstantial or experimental evidence. Here, we develop scalable methods to experimentally establish correct operation for this class of computation, which we implement for three, four and five photons in integrated optical circuits, on Hilbert spaces of up to 50,000 dimensions. Our broad approach is practical for all quantum computational architectures where formal verification methods for quantum algorithms are either intractable or unknown.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""H. H.

article,Truncated-correlation photothermal coherence tomography for deep subsurface analysis,"<p>Photothermal diffusion-wave imaging is a promising technique for the analysis of a range of media. However, traditional diffusion-wave techniques are limited by the physics of parabolic diffusion and can only produce depth-integrated planar images. Here, we report a depth-resolved photothermal imaging modality, henceforth termed truncated-correlation photothermal coherence tomography (TC-PCT). This enables three-dimensional visualization of subsurface features, which is not possible with known optical or photothermal imaging techniques. Examples include imaging of solids with intricate subsurface structures and discontinuities, such as holes in steel, burn depth profiles in tissues, and the structure of bone. It is compatible with regulations concerning maximum permissible exposure and is the photothermal analogue of optical coherence tomography. Axial and lateral resolutions in bone are measured to be &#8764;25 and 100 &#181;m, respectively, with a depth range of &#8764;3.2 mm (approximately four thermal diffusion lengths).</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Center for Advanced Diffusion-Wave Technologies, University of Toronto, 5 King's College Road, Toronto, M5S 3G8, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Sreekumar Kaiplavil"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andreas Mandelis""]}]",False,"[""Sreekumar Kaiplavil"", ""Andreas Mandelis""]","Kaiplavil, S., Mandelis, A.

article,Integrated flexible chalcogenide glass photonic devices,"<p>Photonic integration on thin flexible plastic substrates is important for emerging applications ranging from the realization of flexible interconnects to conformal sensors applied to the skin. Such devices are traditionally fabricated using pattern transfer, which is complicated and has limited integration capacity. Here, we report a convenient monolithic approach to realize flexible, integrated high-index-contrast chalcogenide glass photonic devices. By developing local neutral axis designs and suitable fabrication techniques, we realize a suite of photonic devices including waveguides, microdisk resonators, add&#8211;drop filters and photonic crystals that have excellent optical performance and mechanical flexibility, enabling repeated bending down to sub-millimetre radii without measurable performance degradation. The approach offers a facile fabrication route for three-dimensional high-index-contrast photonics that are difficult to create using traditional methods.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, 19716, Delaware, USA"", ""authors"": [""Lan Li"", "",\u00a0Hongtao Lin"", "",\u00a0Yi Zou"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Juejun Hu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Centre for Mechanics of Solids, Structures and Materials, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, 78712, Texas, USA"", ""authors"": [""Shutao Qiao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Nanshu Lu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Optics and Photonics, CREOL, University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32816, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""Sylvain Danto"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kathleen Richardson""]}, {""address"": ""IRradiance Glass Inc., Orlando, 32828, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kathleen Richardson"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0J.

article,Seeing a single molecule vibrate through time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering,"<p>The motion of chemical bonds within molecules can be observed in real time in the form of vibrational wave packets prepared and interrogated through ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy. Such nonlinear optical measurements are commonly performed on large ensembles of molecules and, as such, are limited to the extent that ensemble coherence can be maintained. Here, we describe vibrational wave packet motion on single molecules, recorded through time-resolved, surface-enhanced, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. The sensitivity required to detect the motion of a single molecule under ambient conditions is achieved by equipping the molecule with a dipolar nano-antenna (a gold dumbbell). In contrast with measurements in ensembles, the vibrational coherence on a single molecule does not undergo pure dephasing. It develops phase fluctuations with characteristic statistics. We present the time evolution of discretely sampled statistical states, and highlight the unique information content in the characteristic, early-time probability distribution function of the signal.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine, 92697, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Steven Yampolsky"", "",\u00a0Dmitry A.

article,Capture of a terahertz wave in a photonic-crystal slab,"<p>With many potential applications in mind, great effort is being applied to develop a terahertz-wave technology platform on which waves can be manipulated with sufficient confinement and efficient interaction for the development of smart components. Here, we utilize the in-plane resonance of a thin, planar photonic-crystal slab with negligible absorption loss to successfully demonstrate and visualize terahertz-wave trapping. We artificially introduce free carriers, which interact with the trapped waves, and capture them in the slab by absorption. Our system exhibits an experimental absorptivity (interaction efficiency) of &#8764;99% and a broad bandwidth (absorptivity of &#8805;90%) that covers 17% of the centre frequency. We also demonstrate its application to the stabilization of terahertz wireless communication systems. Our study shows the capability of photonic crystals as a terahertz-wave platform, the application of which may be extended to other components including filters, couplers, antennas, detectors, modulators, switches and emitters.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, 1\u20133 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, 560-8531, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Ryoma Kakimi"", "",\u00a0Masayuki Fujita"", "",\u00a0Masaya Nagai"", "",\u00a0Masaaki Ashida"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tadao Nagatsuma""]}]",False,"[""Ryoma Kakimi"", ""Masayuki Fujita"", ""Masaya Nagai"", ""Masaaki Ashida"", ""Tadao Nagatsuma""]","Kakimi, R., Fujita, M., Nagai, M. et al.
