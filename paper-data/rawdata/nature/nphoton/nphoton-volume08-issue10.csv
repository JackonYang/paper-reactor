article,Non-invasive single-shot imaging through scattering layers and around corners via speckle correlations,"<p>Optical imaging through and inside complex samples is a difficult challenge with important applications in many fields. The fundamental problem is that inhomogeneous samples such as biological tissue randomly scatter and diffuse light, preventing the formation of diffraction-limited images. Despite many recent advances, no current method can perform non-invasive imaging in real-time using diffused light. Here, we show that, owing to the &#8216;memory-effect&#8217; for speckle correlations, a single high-resolution image of the scattered light, captured with a standard camera, encodes sufficient information to image through visually opaque layers and around corners with diffraction-limited resolution. We experimentally demonstrate single-shot imaging through scattering media and around corners using spatially incoherent light and various samples, from white paint to dynamic biological samples. Our single-shot lensless technique is simple, does not require wavefront-shaping nor time-gated or interferometric detection, and is realized here using a camera-phone. It has the potential to enable imaging in currently inaccessible scenarios.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut Langevin, UMR7587 ESPCI ParisTech and CNRS, INSERM ERL U979, 1 Rue Jussieu, Paris, 75005, France"", ""authors"": [""Ori Katz"", "",\u00a0Pierre Heidmann"", "",\u00a0Mathias Fink"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sylvain Gigan""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, CNRS, Coll\u00e8ge de France, 24 rue Lhomond, Paris, 75005, France"", ""authors"": [""Ori Katz"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sylvain Gigan""]}]",False,"[""Ori Katz"", ""Pierre Heidmann"", ""Mathias Fink"", ""Sylvain Gigan""]","Katz, O., Heidmann, P., Fink, M. et al.

article,On-chip generation of high-order single-photon W-states,"<p>Quantum superposition is the quantum-mechanical property of a particle whereby it inhabits several of its possible quantum states simultaneously. Ideally, this permissible coexistence of quantum states, as defined on any degree of freedom, whether spin, frequency or spatial, can be used to fully exploit the information capacity of the associated physical system. In quantum optics, single photons are the quanta of light, and their coherence properties allow them to establish entangled superpositions between a large number of channels, making them favourable for realizations of quantum information processing schemes. In particular, single-photon W-states (that is, states exhibiting a uniform distribution of the photons across multiple modes) represent a class of multipartite maximally-entangled quantum states that are highly robust to dissipation. Here, we report on the generation and verification of single-photon W-states involving up to 16 spatial modes, and exploit their underlying multi-mode superposition for the on-chip generation of genuine random numbers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Applied Physics, Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller-Universit\u00e4t Jena, Max-Wien-Platz 1, Jena, 07743, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Markus Gr\u00e4fe"", "",\u00a0Ren\u00e9 Heilmann"", "",\u00a0Armando Perez-Leija"", "",\u00a0Robert Keil"", "",\u00a0Felix Dreisow"", "",\u00a0Matthias Heinrich"", "",\u00a0Stefan Nolte"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Alexander Szameit""]}, {""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik, Universit\u00e4t Innsbruck, Technikerstra\u00dfe 25, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Robert Keil""]}, {""address"": ""CREOL, The College of Optics & Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32816, Florida, USA"", ""authors"": [""Matthias Heinrich"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Demetrios N.

article,Ultimate classical communication rates of quantum optical channels,"<p>Optical channels, such as fibres or free-space links, are ubiquitous in today's telecommunication networks. They rely on the electromagnetic field associated with photons to carry information from one point to another in space. A complete physical model of these channels must necessarily take quantum effects into account to determine their ultimate performances. Single-mode, phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels have been extensively studied over past decades, given their importance for practical applications. In spite of this, a long-standing unsolved conjecture on the optimality of Gaussian encodings has prevented finding their classical communication capacity. Here, this conjecture is solved by proving that the vacuum state achieves the minimum output entropy of these channels. This establishes the ultimate achievable bit rate under an energy constraint, as well as the long awaited proof that the single-letter classical capacity of these channels is additive.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NEST, Scuola Normale Superiore and Istituto Nanoscienze-CNR, Pisa, I-56127, Italy"", ""authors"": [""V.

article,Direct generation of three-photon polarization entanglement,"<p>Non-classical states of light are of fundamental importance for emerging quantum technologies. All optics experiments producing multi-qubit entangled states have until now relied on outcome post-selection, a procedure where only the measurement results corresponding to the desired state are considered. This method severely limits the usefulness of the resulting entangled states. Here, we show the direct production of polarization-entangled photon triplets by cascading two entangled downconversion processes. Detecting the triplets with high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors allows us to fully characterize them through quantum state tomography. We use our three-photon entangled state to demonstrate the ability to herald Bell states, a task that was not possible with previous three-photon states, and test local realism by violating the Mermin and Svetlichny inequalities. These results represent a significant breakthrough for entangled multi-photon state production by eliminating the constraints of outcome post-selection, providing a novel resource for optical quantum information processing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, N2L 3G1, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Deny R.
