article,Access to long-term optical memories using photon echoes retrieved from semiconductor spins,"<p>The ability to store optical information is important for both classical and quantum communication. Achieving this in a comprehensive manner (converting the optical field into material excitation, storing this excitation, and releasing it after a controllable time delay) is greatly complicated by the many, often conflicting, properties of the material. More specifically, optical resonances in semiconductor quantum structures with high oscillator strength are inevitably characterized by short excitation lifetimes (and, therefore, short optical memory). Here, we present a new experimental approach to stimulated photon echoes by transferring the information contained in the optical field into a spin system, where it is decoupled from the optical vacuum field and may persist much longer. We demonstrate this for an n-doped CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum well, the storage time of which could be increased by more than three orders of magnitude, from the picosecond range up to tens of nanoseconds.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Experimentelle Physik 2, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund, Dortmund, 44221, Germany"", ""authors"": [""L.

article,All-optical coherent control of vacuum Rabi oscillations,"<p>When an atom strongly couples to a cavity, the two systems can coherently exchange a single quantum excitation through the process of vacuum Rabi oscillation. Controlling this process enables precise synthesis of non-classical light, which plays a central role in quantum information and measurement. Although this control has been realized in microwave-frequency devices, it has been difficult to achieve at optical frequencies, which are essential for quantum communication and metrology. Here, we demonstrate coherent control of vacuum Rabi oscillation in an optical frequency device. We use a photonic molecule composed of two coupled nanocavities to simultaneously achieve strong coupling and a cavity-enhanced a.c. Stark shift. The Stark shift tunes a single quantum dot onto resonance with the photonic molecule on picosecond timescales, creating fast coherent transfer of energy between an atomic and photonic excitation. These results enable ultrafast control of light&#8211;matter quantum interactions in a nanophotonic device platform.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ranojoy Bose"", "",\u00a0Tao Cai"", "",\u00a0Kaushik Roy Choudhury"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Edo Waks""]}, {""address"": ""Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland and National Institute of Standards and Technology, College Park, 20742, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Glenn S.

article,Ultra-high-density spatial division multiplexing with a few-mode multicore fibre,"<p>Single-mode fibres with low loss and a large transmission bandwidth are a key enabler for long-haul high-speed optical communication and form the backbone of our information-driven society. However, we are on the verge of reaching the fundamental limit of single-mode fibre transmission capacity. Therefore, a new means to increase the transmission capacity of optical fibre is essential to avoid a capacity crunch. Here, by employing few-mode multicore fibre, compact three-dimensional waveguide multiplexers and energy-efficient frequency-domain multiple-input multiple-output equalization, we demonstrate the viability of spatial multiplexing to reach a data rate of 5.1&#8197;Tbit&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8197;carrier<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (net 4&#8197;Tbit&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8197;carrier<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) on a single wavelength over a single fibre. Furthermore, by combining this approach with wavelength division multiplexing with 50 wavelength carriers on a dense 50&#8197;GHz grid, a gross transmission throughput of 255&#8197;Tbit&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (net 200&#8197;Tbit&#8197;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) over a 1&#8197;km fibre link is achieved.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, COBRA Research Institute, Eindhoven University of Technology, Den Dolech 2, Eindhoven, PO Box 513, 5600 MB, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""R.

article,Enhancement of laser power-efficiency by control of spatial hole burning interactions,"<p>The laser is an out-of-equilibrium nonlinear wave system where the interplay of the cavity geometry and nonlinear wave interactions mediated by the gain medium determines the self-organized oscillation frequencies and the associated spatial field patterns. In the steady state, a constant energy flux flows through the laser from the pump to the far field, with the ratio of the total output power to the input power determining the power-efficiency. Although nonlinear wave interactions have been modelled and well understood since the early days of laser theory, their impact on the power-efficiency of a laser system is poorly understood. Here, we show that spatial hole burning interactions generally decrease the power-efficiency. We then demonstrate how spatial hole burning interactions can be controlled by a spatially tailored pump profile, thereby boosting the power-efficiency, in some cases by orders of magnitude.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Li Ge"", "",\u00a0Omer Malik"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hakan E.
