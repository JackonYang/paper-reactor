article,Strong light–matter coupling in two-dimensional atomic crystals,"<p>Two-dimensional atomic crystals of graphene, as well as transition-metal dichalcogenides, have emerged as a class of materials that demonstrate strong interaction with light. This interaction can be further controlled by embedding such materials into optical microcavities. When the interaction rate is engineered to be faster than dissipation from the light and matter entities, one reaches the &#8216;strong coupling&#8217; regime. This results in the formation of half-light, half-matter bosonic quasiparticles called microcavity polaritons. Here, we report evidence of strong light&#8211;matter coupling and the formation of microcavity polaritons in a two-dimensional atomic crystal of molybdenum disulphide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) embedded inside a dielectric microcavity at room temperature. A Rabi splitting of 46&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3&#8197;meV is observed in angle-resolved reflectivity and photoluminescence spectra due to coupling between the two-dimensional excitons and the cavity photons. Realizing strong coupling at room temperature in two-dimensional materials that offer a disorder-free potential landscape provides an attractive route for the development of practical polaritonic devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, City College of New York, New York, 10031, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiaoze Liu"", "",\u00a0Tal Galfsky"", "",\u00a0Zheng Sun"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Vinod M.

article,Photon number resolution enables quantum receiver for realistic coherent optical communications,"<p>Quantum-enhanced measurements can provide information about the properties of a physical system with sensitivities beyond what is fundamentally possible with conventional technologies. However, this advantage can be achieved only if quantum measurement technologies are robust against losses and real-world imperfections, and can operate in regimes compatible with existing systems. Here, we demonstrate a quantum receiver for coherent communication, the performance of which not only surpasses the standard quantum limit, but does so for input powers extending to high mean photon numbers. This receiver uses adaptive measurements and photon number resolution to achieve high sensitivity and robustness against imperfections, and ultimately shows the greatest advantage over the standard quantum limit ever achieved by any quantum receiver at power levels compatible with state-of-the-art optical communication systems.

article,Device-level characterization of the flow of light in integrated photonic circuits using ultrafast photomodulation spectroscopy,"<p>Advances in silicon photonics have resulted in rapidly increasing complexity in integrated circuits. New methods that allow the direct characterization of individual optical components in situ, without the need for additional fabrication steps or test structures, are desirable. Here, we present a device-level method for the characterization of photonic chips based on a highly localized modulation in the device using pulsed laser excitation. Optical pumping perturbs the refractive index of silicon, providing a spatially and temporally localized modulation in the transmitted light, enabling time- and frequency-resolved imaging. We demonstrate the versatility of this all-optical modulation technique in imaging and in the quantitative characterization of a range of properties of silicon photonic devices, from group indices in waveguides, to quality factors of a ring resonator, and to the mode structure of a multimode interference device. Ultrafast photomodulation spectroscopy provides important information on devices of complex design, and is easily applicable for testing at the device level.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physics and Astronomy, Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK"", ""authors"": [""Roman Bruck"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Otto L.
