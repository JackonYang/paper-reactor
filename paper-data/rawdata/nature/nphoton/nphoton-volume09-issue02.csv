article,Generation of bright phase-matched circularly-polarized extreme ultraviolet high harmonics,"<p>Circularly-polarized extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation is useful for analysing the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of materials. To date, such radiation has only been available at large-scale X-ray facilities such as synchrotrons. Here, we demonstrate the first bright, phase-matched, extreme ultraviolet circularly-polarized high harmonics source. The harmonics are emitted when bi-chromatic counter-rotating circularly-polarized laser pulses field-ionize a gas in a hollow-core waveguide. We use this new light source for magnetic circular dichroism measurements at the M-shell absorption edges of Co. We show that phase-matching of circularly-polarized harmonics is unique and robust, producing a photon flux comparable to linearly polarized high harmonic sources. This work represents a critical advance towards the development of table-top systems for element-specific imaging and spectroscopy of multiple elements simultaneously in magnetic and other chiral media with very high spatial and temporal resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Solid State Institute and Physics Department, Technion, 32000, Haifa, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Ofer Kfir"", "",\u00a0Avner Fleischer"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Oren Cohen""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics and JILA, University of Colorado and NIST, Boulder, 80309, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Patrik Grychtol"", "",\u00a0Emrah Turgut"", "",\u00a0Ronny Knut"", "",\u00a0Dmitriy Zusin"", "",\u00a0Dimitar Popmintchev"", "",\u00a0Tenio Popmintchev"", "",\u00a0Hans Nembach"", "",\u00a0Henry Kapteyn"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Margaret Murnane""]}, {""address"": ""Electromagnetics Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, 80305, Colorado, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ronny Knut"", "",\u00a0Hans Nembach"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Justin M.

article,Electro-optics of perovskite solar cells,"<p>Organohalide-perovskite solar cells have emerged as a leading next-generation photovoltaic technology. However, despite surging efficiencies, many questions remain unanswered regarding the mechanisms of operation. Here we report a detailed study of the electro-optics of efficient CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>-perovskite-only planar devices. We report the dielectric constants over a large frequency range. Importantly, we found the real part of the static dielectric constant to be &#8764;70, from which we estimate the exciton-binding energy to be of order 2&#8201;meV, which strongly indicates a non-excitonic mechanism. Also, Jonscher's Law behaviour was consistent with the perovskite having ionic character. Accurate knowledge of the cell's optical constants allowed improved modelling and design, and using this information we fabricated an optimized device with an efficiency of 16.5%. The optimized devices have &#8764;100% spectrally flat internal quantum efficiencies and minimal bimolecular recombination. These findings establish systematic design rules to achieve silicon-like efficiencies in simple perovskite solar cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre for Organic Photonics & Electronics, School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences and School of Mathematics and Physics, The University of Queensland, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, 4072, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Qianqian Lin"", "",\u00a0Ardalan Armin"", "",\u00a0Ravi Chandra Raju Nagiri"", "",\u00a0Paul L.

article,Swept confocally-aligned planar excitation (SCAPE) microscopy for high-speed volumetric imaging of behaving organisms,"<p>We report a three-dimensional microscopy technique&#8212;swept, confocally-aligned planar excitation (SCAPE) microscopy&#8212;that allows volumetric imaging of living samples at ultrahigh speeds. Although confocal and two-photon microscopy have revolutionized biomedical research, current implementations are costly, complex and limited in their ability to image three-dimensional volumes at high speeds. Light-sheet microscopy techniques using two-objective, orthogonal illumination and detection require a highly constrained sample geometry and either physical sample translation or complex synchronization of illumination and detection planes. In contrast, SCAPE microscopy acquires images using an angled, swept light sheet in a single-objective, en face geometry. Unique confocal descanning and image rotation optics map this moving plane onto a stationary high-speed camera, permitting completely translationless three-dimensional imaging of intact samples at rates exceeding 20 volumes per second. We demonstrate SCAPE microscopy by imaging spontaneous neuronal firing in the intact brain of awake behaving mice, as well as freely moving transgenic Drosophila larvae.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Radiology, Laboratory for Functional Optical Imaging, Columbia University, New York, 10027, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Matthew B.

article,Einstein–Bohr recoiling double-slit gedanken experiment performed at the molecular level,"<p>Double-slit experiments illustrate the quintessential proof for wave&#8211;particle complementarity. If information is missing about which slit the particle has traversed, the particle, behaving as a wave, passes simultaneously through both slits. This wave-like behaviour and corresponding interference is absent if &#8216;which-slit&#8217; information exists. The essence of Einstein&#8211;Bohr's debate about wave&#8211;particle duality was whether the momentum transfer between a particle and a recoiling slit could mark the path, thus destroying the interference. To measure the recoil of a slit, the slits should move independently. We showcase a materialization of this recoiling double-slit gedanken experiment by resonant X-ray photoemission from molecular oxygen for geometries near equilibrium (coupled slits) and in a dissociative state far away from equilibrium (decoupled slits). Interference is observed in the former case, while the electron momentum transfer quenches the interference in the latter case owing to Doppler labelling of the counter-propagating atomic slits, in full agreement with Bohr's complementarity.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Synchrotron SOLEIL, l'Orme des Merisiers, Saint-Aubin, BP 48, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, 91192, France"", ""authors"": [""Xiao-Jing Liu"", "",\u00a0Faris Gel'mukhanov"", "",\u00a0Minna Patanen"", "",\u00a0Oksana Travnikova"", "",\u00a0Christophe Nicolas"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Catalin Miron""]}, {""address"": ""Theoretical Chemistry and Biology, School of Biotechnology, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, S-106 91, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Quan Miao"", "",\u00a0Faris Gel'mukhanov"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hans \u00c5gren""]}, {""address"": ""College of Electronics, Communication and Physics, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, Shandong, China"", ""authors"": [""Quan Miao""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8577, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kiyoshi Ueda""]}, {""address"": ""Extreme Light Infrastructure \u2013 Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP), \u2018Horia Hulubei\u2019 National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering, 30 Reactorului Street, M\u0103gurele, RO-077125, Jud.

article,Photoacoustically guided wavefront shaping for enhanced optical focusing in scattering media,"<p>Non-invasively focusing light into strongly scattering media, such as biological tissue, is highly desirable but challenging. Recently, ultrasonically guided wavefront-shaping technologies have been developed to address this limitation. So far, the focusing resolution of most implementations has been limited by acoustic diffraction. Here, we introduce nonlinear photoacoustically guided wavefront shaping (PAWS), which achieves optical diffraction-limited focusing in scattering media. We develop an efficient dual-pulse excitation approach to generate strong nonlinear photoacoustic signals based on the Grueneisen relaxation effect. These nonlinear photoacoustic signals are used as feedback to guide iterative wavefront optimization. As a result, light is effectively focused to a single optical speckle grain on the scale of 5&#8211;7&#8197;&#956;m, which is &#8764;10 times smaller than the acoustic focus, with an enhancement factor of &#8764;6,000 in peak fluence. This technology has the potential to benefit many applications that require a highly confined strong optical focus in tissue.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Optical Imaging Laboratory, Washington University in St Louis, St. Louis, 63130-4899, Missouri, USA"", ""authors"": [""Puxiang Lai"", "",\u00a0Lidai Wang"", "",\u00a0Jian Wei Tay"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Lihong V.

article,Deep-ultraviolet to mid-infrared supercontinuum generated in solid-core ZBLAN photonic crystal fibre,"<p>Silica-based photonic crystal fibre has proven highly successful for supercontinuum generation, with smooth and flat spectral power densities. However, fused silica glass suffers from strong material absorption in the mid-infrared (&gt;2,500&#8197;nm), as well as ultraviolet-related optical damage (solarization), which limits performance and lifetime in the ultraviolet (&lt;380&#8197;nm). Supercontinuum generation in silica photonic crystal fibre is therefore only possible between these limits. A number of alternative glasses have been used to extend the mid-infrared performance, including chalcogenides, fluorides and heavy-metal oxides, but none has extended the ultraviolet performance. Here, we describe the successful fabrication (using the stack-and-draw technique) of a ZBLAN photonic crystal fibre with a high air-filling fraction, a small solid core, nanoscale features and near-perfect structure. We also report its use in the generation of ultrabroadband, long-term stable, supercontinua spanning more than three octaves in the spectral range 200&#8211;2,500&#8197;nm.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Guenther-Scharowsky Strasse 1, Bau 24, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Xin Jiang"", "",\u00a0Nicolas Y.
