review article,Physics and applications of laser diode chaos,"<p>This Review Article provides an overview of chaos in laser diodes by surveying experimental achievements in the area and explaining the theory behind the phenomenon. The fundamental physics underpinning laser diode chaos and also the opportunities for harnessing it for potential applications are discussed. The availability and ease of operation of laser diodes, in a wide range of configurations, make them a convenient testbed for exploring basic aspects of nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. It also makes them attractive for practical tasks, such as chaos-based secure communications and random number generation. Avenues for future research and development of chaotic laser diodes are also identified.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Laboratoire Mat\u00e9riaux Optiques, Photonique et Syst\u00e8mes (LMOPS) (CentraleSup\u00e9lec/Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine) and Optics and Electronics (OPTEL) Research Group, 2 Rue Edouard Belin, 57070, Metz, France"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,High-performance multiple-donor bulk heterojunction solar cells,"<p>Broadening the absorption bandwidth of polymer solar cells by incorporating multiple absorber donors into the bulk-heterojunction active layer is an attractive means of resolving the narrow absorption of organic semiconductors. However, this leads to a much more complicated system, and previous efforts have met with only limited success. Here, several dual-donor and multi-donor bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells based on a pool of materials with different absorption ranges and preferred molecular structures were studied. The study shows clearly that compatible polymer donors can coexist harmoniously, but the mixing of incompatible polymers can lead to severe molecular disorder and limit device performance. These results provide guidance for the general use of multiple-donor bulk heterojunctions to overcome the absorption limitation and achieve both high performance and fabrication simplicity for organic solar cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Material Science and Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yang (Michael) Yang"", "",\u00a0Letian Dou"", "",\u00a0Wei-Hsuan Chang"", "",\u00a0Hsin-Sheng Duan"", "",\u00a0Brion Bob"", "",\u00a0Gang Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yang Yang""]}, {""address"": ""Materials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, 60439, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Wei Chen""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Molecular Engineering, the University of Chicago, Chicago, 60637, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Wei Chen""]}, {""address"": ""California NanoSystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yang Yang""]}]",False,"[""Yang (Michael) Yang"", ""Wei Chen"", ""Letian Dou"", ""Wei-Hsuan Chang"", ""Hsin-Sheng Duan"", ""Brion Bob"", ""Gang Li"", ""Yang Yang""]","Yang, Y., Chen, W., Dou, L. et al.

article,Interaction between light and highly confined hypersound in a silicon photonic nanowire,"<p>In the past decade there has been a surge in research at the boundary between photonics and phononics. Most efforts have centred on coupling light to motion in a high-quality optical cavity, typically geared towards manipulating the quantum state of a mechanical oscillator. It was recently predicted that the strength of the light&#8211;sound interaction would increase drastically in nanoscale silicon photonic wires. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, such a giant overlap between near-infrared light and gigahertz sound co-localized in a small-core silicon wire. The wire is supported by a tiny pillar to block the path for external phonon leakage, trapping 10&#8197;GHz phonons in an area of less than 0.1&#8197;&#956;m<sup>2</sup>. Because our geometry can also be studied in microcavities, it paves the way for complete fusion between the fields of cavity optomechanics and Brillouin scattering. The results bode well for the realization of optically driven lasers/sasers, isolators and comb generators on a densely integrated silicon chip.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Photonics Research Group, Ghent University\u2013imec, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Gent 9000, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Rapha\u00ebl Van Laer"", "",\u00a0Bart Kuyken"", "",\u00a0Dries Van Thourhout"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Roel Baets""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Nano- and Biophotonics, Ghent University, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Gent 9000, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Rapha\u00ebl Van Laer"", "",\u00a0Bart Kuyken"", "",\u00a0Dries Van Thourhout"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Roel Baets""]}]",False,"[""Rapha\u00ebl Van Laer"", ""Bart Kuyken"", ""Dries Van Thourhout"", ""Roel Baets""]","Van Laer, R., Kuyken, B., Van Thourhout, D. et al.
