article,"A colour-tunable, weavable fibre-shaped polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell","<p>The emergence of wearable electronics and optoelectronics requires the development of devices that are not only highly flexible but can also be woven into textiles to offer a truly integrated solution. Here, we report a colour-tunable, weavable fibre-shaped polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell (PLEC). The fibre-shaped PLEC is fabricated using all-solution-based processes that can be scaled up for practical applications. The design has a coaxial structure comprising a modified metal wire cathode and a conducting aligned carbon nanotube sheet anode, with an electroluminescent polymer layer sandwiched between them. The fibre shape offers unique and promising advantages. For example, the luminance is independent of viewing angle, the fibre-shaped PLEC can provide a variety of different and tunable colours, it is lightweight, flexible and wearable, and it can potentially be woven into light-emitting clothes for the creation of smart fabrics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Macromolecular Science and Laboratory of Advanced Materials, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Engineering of Polymers, Collaborative Innovation Center of Polymers and Polymer Composite Materials, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China"", ""authors"": [""Zhitao Zhang"", "",\u00a0Yiming Li"", "",\u00a0Xueyi Li"", "",\u00a0Guozhen Guan"", "",\u00a0Houpu Li"", "",\u00a0Yongfeng Luo"", "",\u00a0Fangyuan Zhao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Huisheng Peng""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Application, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200072, China"", ""authors"": [""Kunping Guo"", "",\u00a0Qi Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Bin Wei""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California, Los Angeles, 90095, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Qibing Pei""]}]",False,"[""Zhitao Zhang"", ""Kunping Guo"", ""Yiming Li"", ""Xueyi Li"", ""Guozhen Guan"", ""Houpu Li"", ""Yongfeng Luo"", ""Fangyuan Zhao"", ""Qi Zhang"", ""Bin Wei"", ""Qibing Pei"", ""Huisheng Peng""]","Zhang, Z., Guo, K., Li, Y. et al.A colour-tunable, weavable fibre-shaped polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell.

article,Deep in vivo photoacoustic imaging of mammalian tissues using a tyrosinase-based genetic reporter,"<p>Photoacoustic imaging allows absorption-based high-resolution spectroscopic in vivo imaging at a depth beyond that of optical microscopy. Until recently, photoacoustic imaging has largely been restricted to visualizing the vasculature through endogenous haemoglobin contrast, with most non-vascularized tissues remaining invisible unless exogenous contrast agents are administered. Genetically encodable photoacoustic contrast is attractive as it allows selective labelling of cells, permitting studies of, for example, specific genetic expression, cell growth or more complex biological behaviours in vivo. In this study we report a novel photoacoustic imaging scanner and a tyrosinase-based reporter system that causes human cell lines to synthesize the absorbing pigment eumelanin, thus providing strong photoacoustic contrast. Detailed three-dimensional images of xenografts formed of tyrosinase-expressing cells implanted in mice are obtained in vivo to depths approaching 10&#8197;mm with a spatial resolution below 100&#8197;&#956;m. This scheme is a powerful tool for studying cellular and genetic processes in deep mammalian tissues.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Haematology, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK"", ""authors"": [""Amit P.

article,Waveguide-integrated black phosphorus photodetector with high responsivity and low dark current,"<p>Layered two-dimensional materials have demonstrated novel optoelectronic properties and are well suited for integration in planar photonic circuits. Graphene, for example, has been utilized for wideband photodetection. However, because graphene lacks a bandgap, graphene photodetectors suffer from very high dark current. In contrast, layered black phosphorous, the latest addition to the family of two-dimensional materials, is ideal for photodetector applications due to its narrow but finite bandgap. Here, we demonstrate a gated multilayer black phosphorus photodetector integrated on a silicon photonic waveguide operating in the near-infrared telecom band. In a significant advantage over graphene devices, black phosphorus photodetectors can operate under bias with very low dark current and attain an intrinsic responsivity up to 135&#8197;mA&#8197;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and 657&#8197;mA&#8197;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in 11.5-nm- and 100-nm-thick devices, respectively, at room temperature.

article,Imaging deep within a scattering medium using collective accumulation of single-scattered waves,"<p>Optical microscopy suffers from a loss of resolving power when imaging targets are embedded in thick scattering media because of the dominance of strong multiple-scattered waves over waves scattered only a single time by the targets. Here, we present an approach that maintains full optical resolution when imaging deep within scattering media. We use both time-gated detection and spatial input&#8211;output correlation to identify those reflected waves that conserve in-plane momentum, which is a property of single-scattered waves. By implementing a superradiance-like collective accumulation of the single-scattered waves, we enhance the ratio of the single scattering signal to the multiple scattering background by more than three orders of magnitude. An imaging depth of 11.5 times the scattering mean free path is achieved with a near-diffraction-limited resolution of 1.5&#8201;&#956;m. Our method of distinguishing single- from multiple-scattered waves will open new routes to deep-tissue imaging and studying the physics of the interaction of light with complex media.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, 136-701, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Sungsam Kang"", "",\u00a0Seungwon Jeong"", "",\u00a0Wonjun Choi"", "",\u00a0Hakseok Ko"", "",\u00a0Taeseok D.

article,Compact nanomechanical plasmonic phase modulators,"<p>Highly confined optical energy in plasmonic devices is advancing miniaturization in photonics. However, for mode sizes approaching &#8776;10&#8197;nm, the energy increasingly shifts into the metal, raising losses and hindering active phase modulation. Here, we propose a nanoelectromechanical phase-modulation principle exploiting the extraordinarily strong dependence of the phase velocity of metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal gap plasmons on dynamically variable gap size. We experimentally demonstrate a 23-&#956;m-long non-resonant modulator having a 1.5&#960; rad range, with 1.7&#8197;dB excess loss at 780&#8197;nm. Analysis shows that by simultaneously decreasing the gap, length and width, an ultracompact-footprint &#960; rad phase modulator can be realized. This is achieved without incurring the extra loss expected for plasmons confined in a decreasing gap, because the increasing phase-modulation strength from a narrowing gap offsets rising propagation losses. Such small, high-density electrically controllable components may find applications in optical switch fabrics and reconfigurable plasmonic optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, 08854, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""B.

article,Ultrabright X-ray laser scattering for dynamic warm dense matter physics,"<p>In megabar shock waves, materials compress and undergo a phase transition to a dense charged-particle system that is dominated by strong correlations and quantum effects. This complex state, known as warm dense matter, exists in planetary interiors and many laboratory experiments (for example, during high-power laser interactions with solids or the compression phase of inertial confinement fusion implosions). Here, we apply record peak brightness X-rays at the Linac Coherent Light Source to resolve ionic interactions at atomic (&#229;ngstr&#246;m) scale lengths and to determine their physical properties. Our in situ measurements characterize the compressed lattice and resolve the transition to warm dense matter, demonstrating that short-range repulsion between ions must be accounted for to obtain accurate structure factor and equation of state data. In addition, the unique properties of the X-ray laser provide plasmon spectra that yield the temperature and density with unprecedented precision at micrometre-scale resolution in dynamic compression experiments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, 2575 Sand Hill Road, MS 19, Menlo Park, 94025, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""L.
