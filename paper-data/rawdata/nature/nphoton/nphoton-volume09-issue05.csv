article,Subwavelength vacuum lattices and atom–atom interactions in two-dimensional photonic crystals,"<p>Quantum simulation with cold atoms in optical lattices is an attractive avenue for explorations of quantum many-body physics. A principal challenge in the field is to increase the energy and length scales in current set-ups, thereby reducing temperature and coherence-time requirements. Here, we present a new paradigm for high-density, two-dimensional optical lattices in photonic crystal waveguides. Specially engineered two-dimensional photonic crystals provide a practical platform to trap atoms and engineer their interactions in ways that surpass the limitations of current technologies and enable investigations of novel quantum many-body matter. Our schemes remove the constraint on the lattice constant set by the free-space optical wavelength in favour of deeply sub-wavelength atomic arrays. We further describe possibilities for atom&#8211;atom interactions mediated by photons in two-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides with energy scales several orders of magnitude larger than for exchange interactions in free-space lattices and with the capability to engineer strongly long-range interactions.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Hans-Kopfermann-Str. 1., Garching, 85748, Germany"", ""authors"": [""A.

article,Quantum many-body models with cold atoms coupled to photonic crystals,"<p>Using cold atoms to simulate strongly interacting quantum systems is an exciting frontier of physics. However, because atoms are nominally neutral point particles, this limits the types of interaction that can be produced. We propose to use the powerful new platform of cold atoms trapped near nanophotonic systems to extend these limits, enabling a novel quantum material in which atomic spin degrees of freedom, motion and photons strongly couple over long distances. In this system, an atom trapped near a photonic crystal seeds a localized, tunable cavity mode around the atomic position. We find that this effective cavity facilitates interactions with other atoms within the cavity length, in a way that can be made robust against realistic imperfections. Finally, we show that such phenomena should be accessible using one-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides in which coupling to atoms has already been experimentally demonstrated.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Castelldefels, 08860, Barcelona, Spain"", ""authors"": [""J.

article,Raman quantum memory of photonic polarized entanglement,"<p>The storage of photonic entanglement is central to the achievement of long-distance quantum communication based on quantum repeaters and scalable linear optical quantum computation. Among the memory protocols reported to date, the Raman scheme has the advantages of being broadband and high-speed, resulting in a huge potential in quantum networks. To date there have been no reports on the storage of photonic polarized entanglement using the Raman protocol. Here, two storage experiments using the Raman scheme are reported: (1) heralded single-photon entanglement of the path and polarization storage in a cold atomic ensemble, and (2) polarization entanglement storage in two cold atomic ensembles. The experimental data clearly show that the quantum entanglement is preserved in this memory platform. Our work shows great promise for the establishment of quantum networks in high-speed communications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Dong-Sheng Ding"", "",\u00a0Wei Zhang"", "",\u00a0Zhi-Yuan Zhou"", "",\u00a0Shuai Shi"", "",\u00a0Bao-Sen Shi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Guang-Can Guo""]}, {""address"": ""Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information & Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Dong-Sheng Ding"", "",\u00a0Wei Zhang"", "",\u00a0Zhi-Yuan Zhou"", "",\u00a0Shuai Shi"", "",\u00a0Bao-Sen Shi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Guang-Can Guo""]}]",False,"[""Dong-Sheng Ding"", ""Wei Zhang"", ""Zhi-Yuan Zhou"", ""Shuai Shi"", ""Bao-Sen Shi"", ""Guang-Can Guo""]","Ding, D., Zhang, W., Zhou, Z. et al.

article,Single-beam spectrally controlled two-dimensional Raman spectroscopy,"<p>Vibrational modes are often localized in certain regions of a molecule, and so the coupling between these modes is sensitive to the molecular structure. Two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy can probe the strength of this coupling in a manner analogous to two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, but on ultrafast timescales. Here, we demonstrate how two-dimensional Raman spectroscopy, based on fifth-order optical nonlinearity, can be performed with a single beam of shaped femtosecond optical pulses. Our spectroscopy scheme offers not only a major simplification of the conventional set-up, but also an inherent elimination of a competing nonlinear signal, which overwhelms the desired signal in other schemes and carries no coupling information.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Hadas Frostig"", "",\u00a0Tim Bayer"", "",\u00a0Nirit Dudovich"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yaron Silberberg""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Haifa, 32000, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Yonina C.
