article,High-rate measurement-device-independent quantum cryptography,"<p>Quantum cryptography achieves a formidable task&#8212;the remote distribution of secret keys by exploiting the fundamental laws of physics. Quantum cryptography is now headed towards solving the practical problem of constructing scalable and secure quantum networks. A significant step in this direction has been the introduction of measurement-device independence, where the secret key between two parties is established by the measurement of an untrusted relay. Unfortunately, although qubit-implemented protocols can reach long distances, their key rates are typically very low, unsuitable for the demands of a metropolitan network. Here we show, theoretically and experimentally, that a solution can come from the use of continuous-variable systems. We design a coherent-state network protocol able to achieve remarkably high key rates at metropolitan distances, in fact three orders of magnitude higher than those currently achieved. Our protocol could be employed to build high-rate quantum networks where devices securely connect to nearby access points or proxy servers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Computer Science and York Centre for Quantum Technologies, University of York, York, YO10 5GH, UK"", ""authors"": [""Stefano Pirandola"", "",\u00a0Carlo Ottaviani"", "",\u00a0Gaetana Spedalieri"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Samuel L.

article,Efficient inverted polymer solar cells employing favourable molecular orientation,"<p>Improving the power conversion efficiency of polymer-based bulk-heterojunction solar cells is a critical issue. Here, we show that high efficiencies of &#8764;10% can be obtained using the crystalline polymer PNTz4T in single-junction inverted cells with a thick active layer having a thickness of &#8764;300&#8197;nm. The improved performance is probably due to the large population of polymer crystallites with a face-on orientation and the &#8216;favourable&#8217; distribution of edge-on and face-on crystallites along the film thickness (revealed by in-depth studies of the blend films using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction), which results in a reduction in charge recombination and efficient charge transport. These results underscore the great promise of polymer solar cells and raise the hope of achieving even higher efficiencies by means of materials development and control of molecular ordering.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Materials Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, 923-1292, Ishikawa, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Varun Vohra"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hideyuki Murata""]}, {""address"": ""Emergent Molecular Function Research Group, RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), Wako, 351-0198, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuaki Kawashima"", "",\u00a0Itaru Osaka"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kazuo Takimiya""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Applied Chemistry, Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, 1-4-1 Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima, 739-8527, Hiroshima, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kazuaki Kawashima"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Takeshi Kakara""]}, {""address"": ""Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, 1-1-1 Kouto, Sayo-cho, Sayo-gun, 679-5198, Hyogo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Tomoyuki Koganezawa""]}, {""address"": ""Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Chiyoda-ku, 102-0075, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Itaru Osaka""]}]",False,"[""Varun Vohra"", ""Kazuaki Kawashima"", ""Takeshi Kakara"", ""Tomoyuki Koganezawa"", ""Itaru Osaka"", ""Kazuo Takimiya"", ""Hideyuki Murata""]","Vohra, V., Kawashima, K., Kakara, T. et al.

article,Thin-film Sb2Se3 photovoltaics with oriented one-dimensional ribbons and benign grain boundaries,"<p>Solar cells based on inorganic absorbers, such as Si, GaAs, CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub>, permit a high device efficiency and stability. The crystals&#8217; three-dimensional structure means that dangling bonds inevitably exist at the grain boundaries (GBs), which significantly degrades the device performance via recombination losses. Thus, the growth of single-crystalline materials or the passivation of defects at the GBs is required to address this problem, which introduces an added processing complexity and cost. Here we report that antimony selenide (Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>)&#8212;a simple, non-toxic and low-cost material with an optimal solar bandgap of &#8764;1.1&#8197;eV&#8212;exhibits intrinsically benign GBs because of its one-dimensional crystal structure. Using a simple and fast (&#8764;1&#8197;&#956;m min<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) rapid thermal evaporation process, we oriented crystal growth perpendicular to the substrate, and produced Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> thin-film solar cells with a certified device efficiency of 5.6%. Our results suggest that the family of one-dimensional crystals, including Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, SbSeI and Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, show promise in photovoltaic applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, 430074, China"", ""authors"": [""Ying Zhou"", "",\u00a0Liang Wang"", "",\u00a0Sikai Qin"", "",\u00a0Xinsheng Liu"", "",\u00a0Jie Chen"", "",\u00a0Ding-Jiang Xue"", "",\u00a0Miao Luo"", "",\u00a0Yuanzhi Cao"", "",\u00a0Yibing Cheng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jiang Tang""]}, {""address"": ""School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, 430074, China"", ""authors"": [""Ying Zhou"", "",\u00a0Liang Wang"", "",\u00a0Sikai Qin"", "",\u00a0Xinsheng Liu"", "",\u00a0Jie Chen"", "",\u00a0Ding-Jiang Xue"", "",\u00a0Miao Luo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jiang Tang""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory for Polar Materials and Devices (MOE), East China Normal University, Shanghai, 200241, China"", ""authors"": [""Shiyou Chen""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 3G4, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Edward H.
