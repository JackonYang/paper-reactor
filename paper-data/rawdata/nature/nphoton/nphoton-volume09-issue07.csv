article,Detection of X-ray photons by solution-processed lead halide perovskites,"<p>The evolution of real-time medical diagnostic tools such as angiography and computer tomography from radiography based on photographic plates was enabled by the development of integrated solid-state X-ray photon detectors made from conventional solid-state semiconductors. Recently, for optoelectronic devices operating in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions, solution-processed organic and inorganic semiconductors have also attracted a great deal of attention. Here, we demonstrate a possibility to use such inexpensive semiconductors for the sensitive detection of X-ray photons by direct photon-to-current conversion. In particular, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) offers a compelling combination of fast photoresponse and a high absorption cross-section for X-rays, owing to the heavy Pb and I atoms. Solution-processed photodiodes as well as photoconductors are presented, exhibiting high values of X-ray sensitivity (up to 25&#8197;&#956;C&#8197;mGy<sub>air</sub><sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8197;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>) and responsivity (1.9&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>4</sup>&#8197;carriers/photon), which are commensurate with those obtained by the current solid-state technology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Semiconductor and Solid State Physics, University Linz, Altenbergerstra\u00dfe 69, Linz, 4040, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Sergii Yakunin"", "",\u00a0Mykhailo Sytnyk"", "",\u00a0Dominik Kriegner"", "",\u00a0Julian Stangl"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wolfgang Heiss""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, CH-8093, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Sergii Yakunin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Maksym V.

article,Vectorial dissipative solitons in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers with delays,"<p>We show that the nonlinear polarization dynamics of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser placed in an external cavity lead to the emission of temporal dissipative solitons. These are vectorial solitons because they appear as localized pulses in the polarized output, but leave the total intensity constant. When the cavity roundtrip time is much longer than the soliton duration, several independent solitons as well as bound states (molecules) may be hosted in the cavity. All these solitons coexist together and with the background solution. The experimental results are well described by a theoretical model that can be reduced to a single delayed equation for the polarization orientation, which allows the vectorial solitons to be interpreted as polarization kinks. A Floquet analysis is used to confirm the mutual independence of the observed solitons.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut Non Lin\u00e9aire de Nice, Universit\u00e9 de Nice Sophia Antipolis \u2013 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1361 route des lucioles, Valbonne, F-06560, France"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Quantum cascade laser frequency stabilization at the sub-Hz level,"<p>High-precision measurements with molecules may refine our knowledge of various fields of physics, from atmospheric and interstellar physics to the standard model or physics beyond it. Most of them can be cast as absorption frequency measurements, particularly in the mid-infrared &#8216;molecular fingerprint&#8217; region, creating the need for narrow-linewidth lasers of well-controlled frequency. Quantum cascade lasers provide a wide spectral coverage anywhere in the mid-infrared, but show substantial free-running frequency fluctuations. Here, we demonstrate that the excellent stability and accuracy of an ultra-stable near-infrared laser, transferred from a metrological institute through a fibre link, can be copied to a quantum cascade laser using an optical frequency comb. The obtained relative stability and accuracy of 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;15</sup> and 10<sup>&#8722;14</sup> exceed those demonstrated so far with quantum cascade lasers by almost two orders of magnitude.

article,Flying particle sensors in hollow-core photonic crystal fibre,"<p>Optical fibre sensors make use of diverse physical effects to measure parameters such as strain, temperature and electric field. Here we introduce a new class of reconfigurable fibre sensor, based on a &#8216;flying-particle&#8217; optically trapped inside a hollow-core photonic crystal fibre and illustrate its use in electric field and temperature sensing with high spatial resolution. The electric field distribution near the surface of a multi-element electrode is measured with a resolution of &#8764;100&#8197;&#956;m by monitoring changes in the transmitted light signal due to the transverse displacement of a charged silica microparticle trapped within the hollow core. Doppler-based velocity measurements are used to map the gas viscosity, and thus the temperature, along a hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. The flying-particle approach represents a new paradigm in fibre sensors, potentially allowing multiple physical quantities to be mapped with high positional accuracy over kilometre-scale distances.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Guenther-Scharowsky-Str. 1, Bldg 24, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""D.

article,Macroscopic and direct light propulsion of bulk graphene material,"<p>It has been a great challenge to achieve the direct light manipulation of matter on a bulk scale. In this work the direct light propulsion of matter is observed on a macroscopic scale using a bulk graphene-based material. The unique structure and properties of graphene, and the novel morphology of the bulk three-dimensional linked graphene material make it capable not only of absorbing light at various wavelengths but also of emitting energetic electrons efficiently enough to drive the bulk material, following Newtonian mechanics. Thus, the unique photonic and electronic properties of individual graphene sheets are manifested in the response of the bulk state. These results offer an exciting opportunity to bring about bulk-scale light manipulation with the potential to realize long-sought applications in areas such as the solar sail and space transportation driven directly by sunlight.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Functional Polymer Materials and Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering, Institute of Polymer Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China"", ""authors"": [""Tengfei Zhang"", "",\u00a0Huicong Chang"", "",\u00a0Yingpeng Wu"", "",\u00a0Peishuang Xiao"", "",\u00a0Ningbo Yi"", "",\u00a0Yanhong Lu"", "",\u00a0Yanfeng Ma"", "",\u00a0Yi Huang"", "",\u00a0Kai Zhao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yongsheng Chen""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Weak Light Nonlinear Photonics, Ministry of Education, Teda Applied Physics School and School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300457, China"", ""authors"": [""Xiao-Qing Yan"", "",\u00a0Zhi-Bo Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Guo Tian""]}]",False,"[""Tengfei Zhang"", ""Huicong Chang"", ""Yingpeng Wu"", ""Peishuang Xiao"", ""Ningbo Yi"", ""Yanhong Lu"", ""Yanfeng Ma"", ""Yi Huang"", ""Kai Zhao"", ""Xiao-Qing Yan"", ""Zhi-Bo Liu"", ""Jian-Guo Tian"", ""Yongsheng Chen""]","Zhang, T., Chang, H., Wu, Y. et al.
