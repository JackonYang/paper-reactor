article,Direct optical nanoscopy with axially localized detection,"<p>Evanescent light excitation is widely used in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to confine light and reduce background noise. Here, we propose a method of exploiting evanescent light in the context of emission. When a fluorophore is located in close proximity to a medium with a higher refractive index, its near-field component is converted into light that propagates beyond the critical angle. This so-called supercritical-angle fluorescence can be captured using a high-numerical-aperture objective and used to determine the axial position of the fluorophore with nanometre precision. We introduce a new technique for three-dimensional nanoscopy that combines direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) with dedicated detection of supercritical-angle fluorescence emission. We demonstrate that our approach of direct optical nanoscopy with axially localized detection (DONALD) typically yields an isotropic three-dimensional localization precision of 20&#8197;nm within an axial range of &#8764;150&#8197;nm above the coverslip.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut des Sciences Mol\u00e9culaires d'Orsay (ISMO), Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, CNRS UMR 8214, Orsay Cedex, F91405, France"", ""authors"": [""N.

article,Mode-locked dark pulse Kerr combs in normal-dispersion microresonators,"<p>The generation of Kerr frequency combs in a coherently driven nonlinear microresonator is now extensively investigated more generally by the research community as a potentially portable technology for a variety of applications. Here, we report experiments in which dark pulse combs are formed in normal-dispersion microresonators with mode-interaction-assisted excitation, and mode-locking transitions are observed in the normal-dispersion regime. The mode-interaction-aided excitation of dark pulses appears to occur through a deterministic pathway, in sharp contrast to the situation for bright pulses in the anomalous dispersion region. The ability to mode-lock in the normal-dispersion regime increases the freedom in the microresonator design and may make it possible to extend Kerr comb generation into the visible, where material dispersion is likely to dominate.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, 465 Northwestern Avenue, West Lafayette, 47907-2035, Indiana, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiaoxiao Xue"", "",\u00a0Yi Xuan"", "",\u00a0Yang Liu"", "",\u00a0Pei-Hsun Wang"", "",\u00a0Steven Chen"", "",\u00a0Jian Wang"", "",\u00a0Dan E.

article,Plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer for solar energy conversion,"<p>In F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), energy non-radiatively transfers from a blue-shifted emitter to a red-shifted absorber by dipole&#8211;dipole coupling. This study shows that plasmonics enables the opposite transfer direction, transferring the plasmonic energy towards the short-wavelength direction to induce charge separation in a semiconductor. Plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) differs from FRET because of the lack of a Stoke's shift, non-local absorption effects and a strong dependence on the plasmon's dephasing rate and dipole moment. PIRET non-radiatively transfers energy through an insulating spacer layer, which prevents interfacial charge recombination losses and dephasing of the plasmon from hot-electron transfer. The distance dependence of dipole&#8211;dipole coupling is mapped out for a range of detuning across the plasmon resonance. PIRET can efficiently harvest visible and near-infrared sunlight with energy below the semiconductor band edge to help overcome the constraints of band-edge energetics for single semiconductors in photoelectrochemical cells, photocatalysts and photovoltaics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, 26506-6106, West Virginia, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jiangtian Li"", "",\u00a0Scott K.

article,Inverse four-wave mixing and self-parametric amplification in optical fibre,"<p>An important group of nonlinear processes in optical fibre involve the mixing of four waves due to the intensity dependence of the refractive index. It is customary to distinguish between nonlinear effects that require external/pumping waves (cross-phase modulation and parametric processes such as four-wave mixing) and those arising from self-action of the propagating optical field (self-phase modulation and modulation instability). Here, we present a new nonlinear self-action effect&#8212;self-parametric amplification&#8212;which manifests itself as optical spectrum narrowing in normal dispersion fibre, leading to very stable propagation with a distinctive spectral distribution. The narrowing results from inverse four-wave mixing, resembling an effective parametric amplification of the central part of the spectrum by energy transfer from the spectral tails. Self-parametric amplification and the observed stable nonlinear spectral propagation with a random temporal waveform can find applications in optical communications and high-power fibre lasers with nonlinear intracavity dynamics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University, Birmingham, B4 7ET, UK"", ""authors"": [""Sergei K.

article,Boson sampling for molecular vibronic spectra,"<p>Controllable quantum devices open novel directions to both quantum computation and quantum simulation. Recently, a problem known as boson sampling has been shown to provide a pathway for solving a computationally intractable problem without the need for a full quantum computer, instead using a linear optics quantum set-up. In this work, we propose a modification of boson sampling for the purpose of quantum simulation. In particular, we show that, by means of squeezed states of light coupled to a boson sampling optical network, one can generate molecular vibronic spectra, a problem for which no efficient classical algorithm is currently known. We provide a general framework for carrying out these simulations via unitary quantum optical transformations and supply specific molecular examples for future experimental realization.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, 02138, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Joonsuk Huh"", "",\u00a0Gian Giacomo Guerreschi"", "",\u00a0Borja Peropadre"", "",\u00a0Jarrod R.
