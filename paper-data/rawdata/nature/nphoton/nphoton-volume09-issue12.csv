article,Experimental quantum key distribution without monitoring signal disturbance,"<p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method of realizing private communication securely against an adversary with unlimited power. The QKD protocols proposed and demonstrated over the past 30&#8197;years relied on the monitoring of signal disturbance to set an upper limit to the amount of leaked information. Here, we report an experimental realization of the recently proposed round-robin differential-phase-shift protocol. We used a receiver set-up in which photons are randomly routed to one of four interferometers with different delays so that the phase difference is measured uniformly over all pair combinations among five pulses comprising the quantum signal. The amount of leak can be bounded from this randomness alone, and a secure key was extracted even when a finite communication time and the threshold nature of photon detectors were taken into account. This demonstrates the first QKD experiment without signal disturbance monitoring, thus opening up a new direction towards secure communication.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1 Morinosato Wakamiya, Atsugi, 243-0198, Kanagawa, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Hiroki Takesue"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kiyoshi Tamaki""]}, {""address"": ""Photon Science Center, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8656, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Toshihiko Sasaki"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masato Koashi""]}]",False,"[""Hiroki Takesue"", ""Toshihiko Sasaki"", ""Kiyoshi Tamaki"", ""Masato Koashi""]","Takesue, H., Sasaki, T., Tamaki, K. et al.

article,Experimental demonstration of a quantum key distribution without signal disturbance monitoring,"<p>In existing quantum key distribution protocols, two legitimate peers, Alice and Bob, must monitor the signal disturbance to place a bound on the potential information leakage. However, in the round-robin differential phase shift (RRDPS) protocol, monitoring of the signal disturbance is unnecessary. Here, we present the first active implementation of the RRDPS protocol. In our experiment, Alice prepares packets of pulses, where each packet is a train with 65 pulses and the global phase of each packet is randomized. Bob uses a novel actively controlled variable-delay interferometer to realize the random switching of different delays. Benefiting from the large pulse number of each packet, and the high stability and low insertion loss of the interferometer, the system can distribute a secret key over a distance of 90&#8197;km. Our experimental demonstration and results confirm the feasibility of the RRDPS protocol, particularly in high-error situations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Quantum Information, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, China"", ""authors"": [""Shuang Wang"", "",\u00a0Zhen-Qiang Yin"", "",\u00a0Wei Chen"", "",\u00a0De-Yong He"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Tian Song"", "",\u00a0Hong-Wei Li"", "",\u00a0Li-Jun Zhang"", "",\u00a0Zheng Zhou"", "",\u00a0Guang-Can Guo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zheng-Fu Han""]}, {""address"": ""Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information & Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Shuang Wang"", "",\u00a0Zhen-Qiang Yin"", "",\u00a0Wei Chen"", "",\u00a0De-Yong He"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Tian Song"", "",\u00a0Hong-Wei Li"", "",\u00a0Li-Jun Zhang"", "",\u00a0Zheng Zhou"", "",\u00a0Guang-Can Guo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zheng-Fu Han""]}]",False,"[""Shuang Wang"", ""Zhen-Qiang Yin"", ""Wei Chen"", ""De-Yong He"", ""Xiao-Tian Song"", ""Hong-Wei Li"", ""Li-Jun Zhang"", ""Zheng Zhou"", ""Guang-Can Guo"", ""Zheng-Fu Han""]","Wang, S., Yin, Z., Chen, W. et al.

article,Room-temperature InP distributed feedback laser array directly grown on silicon,"<p>Fully exploiting the silicon photonics platform for large-volume, cost-sensitive applications requires a fundamentally new approach to directly integrate high-performance laser sources using wafer-scale fabrication methods. Direct-bandgap III&#8211;V semiconductors allow efficient light generation, but the large mismatch in lattice constant, thermal expansion and crystal polarity makes their epitaxial growth directly on silicon extremely complex. Using a selective-area growth technique in confined regions, we surpass this fundamental limit and demonstrate an optically pumped InP-based distributed feedback laser array monolithically grown on (001)-silicon operating at room temperature and suitable for wavelength-division-multiplexing applications. The novel epitaxial technology suppresses threading dislocations and anti-phase boundaries to a less than 20-nm-thick layer, which does not affect device performance. Using an in-plane laser cavity defined using standard top-down lithographic patterning together with a high yield and high uniformity provides scalability and a straightforward path towards cost-effective co-integration with silicon photonic and electronic circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Photonics Research Group, Ghent University\u2013imec, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent, 9000, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Zhechao Wang"", "",\u00a0Bin Tian"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dries Van Thourhout""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Nano- and Biophotonics (NB-Photonics), Ghent University, Sint-Pietersnieuwstraat 41, Ghent, 9000, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Zhechao Wang"", "",\u00a0Bin Tian"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dries Van Thourhout""]}, {""address"": ""IMEC, Kapeldreef 75, Heverlee, 3001, Belgium"", ""authors"": [""Marianna Pantouvaki"", "",\u00a0Weiming Guo"", "",\u00a0Philippe Absil"", "",\u00a0Joris Van Campenhout"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Clement Merckling""]}]",False,"[""Zhechao Wang"", ""Bin Tian"", ""Marianna Pantouvaki"", ""Weiming Guo"", ""Philippe Absil"", ""Joris Van Campenhout"", ""Clement Merckling"", ""Dries Van Thourhout""]","Wang, Z., Tian, B., Pantouvaki, M. et al.

article,X-ray imaging with scintillator-sensitized hybrid organic photodetectors,"<p>Medical X-ray imaging requires cost-effective and high-resolution flat-panel detectors for the energy range between 20 and 120&#8197;keV. Solution-processed photodetectors provide the opportunity to fabricate detectors with a large active area at low cost. Here, we present a disruptive approach that improves the resolution of such detectors by incorporating terbium-doped gadolinium oxysulfide scintillator particles into an organic photodetector matrix. The X-ray induced light emission from the scintillators is absorbed within hundreds of nanometres, which is negligible compared with the pixel size. Hence, optical crosstalk, a limiting factor in the resolution of scintillator-based X-ray detectors, is minimized. The concept is validated with a 256&#8201;&#215;&#8201;256 pixel detector with a resolution of 4.75&#8197;lp mm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at a MTF&#8201;=&#8201;0.2, significantly better than previous stacked scintillator-based flat-panel detectors. We achieved a resolution that proves the feasibility of solution-based detectors in medical applications. Time-resolved electrical characterization showed enhanced charge carrier mobility with increased scintillator filling, which is explained by morphological changes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Technology Center, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Patric B\u00fcchele"", "",\u00a0Sandro F.
