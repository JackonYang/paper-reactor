article,Modified optical absorption of molecules on metallic nanoparticles at sub-monolayer coverage,"<p>Enhanced optical absorption of molecules in the vicinity of metallic nanostructures is key to a number of surface-enhanced spectroscopies and of great general interest to the fields of plasmonics and nano-optics. However, experimental access to this absorbance has long proven elusive. Here, we present direct measurements of the surface absorbance of dye molecules adsorbed onto silver nanospheres and, crucially, at sub-monolayer concentrations where dye&#8211;dye interactions become negligible. With a large detuning from the plasmon resonance, distinct shifts and broadening of the molecular resonances reveal the intrinsic properties of the dye in contact with the metal colloid, in contrast to the often studied strong-coupling regime where the optical properties of the dye molecules cannot be isolated. The observation of these shifts together with the ability to routinely measure them has broad implications in the interpretation of experiments involving resonant molecules on metallic surfaces, such as surface-enhanced spectroscopies and many aspects of molecular plasmonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""The MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, School of Chemical and Physical Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, PO Box 600, Wellington, 6140, New Zealand"", ""authors"": [""Brendan L.

article,Towards graphene plasmon-based free-electron infrared to X-ray sources,"<p>Rapid progress in nanofabrication methods has fuelled a quest for ultra-compact photonic integrated systems and nanoscale light sources. The prospect of small-footprint, high-quality emitters of short-wavelength radiation is especially exciting due to the importance of extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray radiation as research and diagnostic tools in medicine, engineering and the natural sciences. Here, we propose a highly directional, tunable and monochromatic radiation source based on electrons interacting with graphene plasmons. Our complementary analytical theory and ab initio simulations demonstrate that the high momentum of the strongly confined graphene plasmons enables the generation of high-frequency radiation from relatively low-energy electrons, bypassing the need for lengthy electron acceleration stages or extreme laser intensities. For instance, highly directional 20&#8197;keV photons could be generated in a table-top design using electrons from conventional radiofrequency electron guns. The conductive nature and high damage threshold of graphene make it especially suitable for this application. Our electron&#8211;plasmon scattering theory is readily extended to other systems in which free electrons interact with surface waves.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Liang Jie Wong""]}, {""address"": ""Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, 2 Fusionopolis Way, Innovis, Singapore, 138634, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Liang Jie Wong""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ido Kaminer"", "",\u00a0Ognjen Ilic"", "",\u00a0John D.

article,Observation of a hot-phonon bottleneck in lead-iodide perovskites,"<p>We study the carrier dynamics in planar methyl ammonium lead iodide perovskite films using broadband transient absorption spectroscopy. We show that the sharp optical absorption onset is due to an exciton transition that is inhomogeneously broadened with a binding energy of 9&#8197;meV. We fully characterize the transient absorption spectrum by free-carrier-induced bleaching of the exciton transition, quasi-Fermi energy, carrier temperature and bandgap renormalization constant. The photo-induced carrier temperature is extracted from the transient absorption spectra and monitored as a function of delay time for different excitation wavelengths and photon fluences. We find an efficient hot-phonon bottleneck that slows down cooling of hot carriers by three to four orders of magnitude in time above a critical injection carrier density of &#8764;5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>17</sup>&#8197;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>.

article,Optically reconfigurable metasurfaces and photonic devices based on phase change materials,"<p>Photonic components with adjustable parameters, such as variable-focal-length lenses or spectral filters, which can change functionality upon optical stimulation, could offer numerous useful applications. Tuning of such components is conventionally achieved by either micro- or nanomechanical actuation of their constituent parts, by stretching or by heating. Here, we report a novel approach for making reconfigurable optical components that are created with light in a non-volatile and reversible fashion. Such components are written, erased and rewritten as two-dimensional binary or greyscale patterns into a nanoscale film of phase-change material by inducing a refractive-index-changing phase transition with tailored trains of femtosecond pulses. We combine germanium&#8211;antimony&#8211;tellurium-based films with a diffraction-limited resolution optical writing process to demonstrate a variety of devices: visible-range reconfigurable bichromatic and multi-focus Fresnel zone plates, a super-oscillatory lens with subwavelength focus, a greyscale hologram, and a dielectric metamaterial with on-demand reflection and transmission resonances.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optoelectronics Research Centre and Centre for Photonic Metamaterials, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK"", ""authors"": [""Qian Wang"", "",\u00a0Edward T.
