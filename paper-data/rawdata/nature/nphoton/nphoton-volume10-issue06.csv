article,Optomechanically induced stochastic resonance and chaos transfer between optical fields,"<p>Chaotic dynamics has been reported in many physical systems and has affected almost every field of science. Chaos involves hypersensitivity to the initial conditions of a system and introduces unpredictability into its output. Thus, it is often unwanted. Interestingly, the very same features make chaos a powerful tool to suppress decoherence, achieve secure communication and replace background noise in stochastic resonance&#8212;a counterintuitive concept that a system's ability to transfer information can be coherently amplified by adding noise. Here, we report the first demonstration of chaos-induced stochastic resonance in an optomechanical system, as well as the optomechanically mediated chaos transfer between two optical fields such that they follow the same route to chaos. These results will contribute to the understanding of nonlinear phenomena and chaos in optomechanical systems, and may find applications in the chaotic transfer of information and for improving the detection of otherwise undetectable signals in optomechanical systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, St Louis, 63130, Missouri, USA"", ""authors"": [""Faraz Monifi"", "",\u00a0Jing Zhang"", "",\u00a0\u015eahin Kaya \u00d6zdemir"", "",\u00a0Bo Peng"", "",\u00a0Fang Bo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Lan Yang""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China"", ""authors"": [""Jing Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Quantum Information Science and Technology, TNList, Beijing, 100084, China"", ""authors"": [""Jing Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yu-xi Liu""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China"", ""authors"": [""Yu-xi Liu""]}, {""address"": ""The MOE Key Laboratory of Weak Light Nonlinear Photonics, TEDA Applied Physics Institute and School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300457, China"", ""authors"": [""Fang Bo""]}, {""address"": ""CEMS, RIKEN, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Franco Nori""]}, {""address"": ""Physics Department, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109-1040, Michigan, USA"", ""authors"": [""Franco Nori""]}]",False,"[""Faraz Monifi"", ""Jing Zhang"", ""\u015eahin Kaya \u00d6zdemir"", ""Bo Peng"", ""Yu-xi Liu"", ""Fang Bo"", ""Franco Nori"", ""Lan Yang""]","Monifi, F., Zhang, J., Özdemir, Ş. et al.

article,Large-scale Ising spin network based on degenerate optical parametric oscillators,"<p>Solving combinatorial optimization problems is becoming increasingly important in modern society, where the analysis and optimization of unprecedentedly complex systems are required. Many such problems can be mapped onto the ground-state-search problem of the Ising Hamiltonian, and simulating the Ising spins with physical systems is now emerging as a promising approach for tackling such problems. Here, we report a large-scale network of artificial spins based on degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs), paving the way towards a photonic Ising machine capable of solving difficult combinatorial optimization problems. We generate &gt;10,000 time-division-multiplexed DOPOs using dual-pump four-wave mixing in a highly nonlinear fibre placed in a cavity. Using those DOPOs, a one-dimensional Ising model is simulated by introducing nearest-neighbour optical coupling. We observe the formation of spin domains and find that the domain size diverges near the DOPO threshold, which suggests that the DOPO network can simulate the behaviour of low-temperature Ising spins.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, 3-1 Morinosato Wakamiya, Atsugi, 243-0198, Kanagawa, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takahiro Inagaki"", "",\u00a0Kensuke Inaba"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hiroki Takesue""]}, {""address"": ""E.

article,Cavity-enhanced light emission from electrically driven carbon nanotubes,"<p>An important advancement towards optical communication on a chip would be the development of integratable, nanoscale photonic emitters with tailored optical properties. Here we demonstrate the use of carbon nanotubes as electrically driven high-speed emitters in combination with a nanophotonic cavity that allows for exceptionally narrow linewidths. The one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities are shown to spectrally select desired emission wavelengths, enhance intensity and efficiently couple light into the underlying photonic network with high reproducibility. Under pulsed voltage excitation, we realize on-chip modulation rates in the GHz range, compatible with active photonic networks. Because the linewidth of the molecular emitter is determined by the quality factor of the photonic crystal, our approach effectively eliminates linewidth broadening due to temperature, surface interaction and hot-carrier injection.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, 76021, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Felix Pyatkov"", "",\u00a0Valentin F\u00fctterling"", "",\u00a0Svetlana Khasminskaya"", "",\u00a0Benjamin S.
