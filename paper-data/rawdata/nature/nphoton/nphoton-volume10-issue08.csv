article,Stain-free histopathology by programmable supercontinuum pulses,"<p>The preparation, staining, visualization and interpretation of histological images of tissue is well accepted as the gold standard process for the diagnosis of disease. These methods have a long history of development, and are used ubiquitously in pathology, despite being highly time- and labour-intensive. Here, we introduce a unique optical imaging platform and methodology for label-free multimodal multiphoton microscopy that uses a novel photonic-crystal fibre source to generate tailored chemical contrast based on programmable supercontinuum pulses. We demonstrate the collection of optical signatures of the tumour microenvironment, including evidence of mesoscopic biological organization, tumour cell migration and (lymph-) angiogenesis collected directly from fresh ex vivo mammary tissue. Acquisition of these optical signatures and other cellular or extracellular features, which are largely absent from histologically processed and stained tissue, combined with an adaptable platform for optical alignment-free programmable-contrast imaging, offers the potential to translate stain-free molecular histopathology into routine clinical use.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Haohua Tu"", "",\u00a0Yuan Liu"", "",\u00a0Marina Marjanovic"", "",\u00a0Eric J.

article,Phase-locked laser arrays through global antenna mutual coupling,"<p>Phase locking of an array of lasers is a highly effective method in beam shaping because it increases the output power and reduces the lasing threshold. Here, we show a conceptually novel phase-locking mechanism based on &#8216;antenna mutual coupling&#8217; in which laser elements interact through far-field radiations with definite phase relations. This allows a long-range global coupling among the array elements to achieve a robust phase locking in two-dimensional laser arrays. The scheme is ideal for lasers with a deep subwavelength confined cavity, such as nanolasers, whose divergent beam patterns could be used to achieve a strong coupling among the elements in the array. We demonstrated experimentally such a scheme based on subwavelength short-cavity surface-emitting lasers at terahertz frequencies. More than 37 laser elements that span over &#8764;8&#8197;&#955;<sub>o</sub> were phase locked to each other, and delivered up to 6.5&#8197;mW (in a pulsed operation) single-mode radiation at &#8764;3&#8197;THz, with a maximum 450&#8197;mW&#8201;A<sup>&#8211;1</sup> slope efficiency and a near-diffraction-limited beam divergence.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tsung-Yu Kao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Qing Hu""]}, {""address"": ""LongWave Photonics LLC, Mountain View, 94043, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tsung-Yu Kao""]}, {""address"": ""Sandia National Laboratories, Center of Integrated Nanotechnologies, MS 1303, Albuquerque, 87185-130, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""John L.

article,Space–time characterization of ultra-intense femtosecond laser beams,"<p>Femtosecond lasers can now deliver ultrahigh intensities at focus, making it possible to induce relativistic motion of charged particles with light and opening the way to new generations of compact particle accelerators and X-ray sources. With diameters of up to tens of centimetres, ultra-intense laser beams tend to suffer from spatiotemporal distortions, that is, a spatial dependence of their temporal properties that can dramatically reduce their peak intensities. At present, however, these intense electromagnetic fields are characterized and optimized in space and time separately. Here, we present the first complete spatiotemporal experimental reconstruction of the field E(t,r) for a 100&#8197;TW peak-power laser, and reveal the spatiotemporal distortions that can affect such beams. This new measurement capability opens the way to in-depth characterization and optimization of ultra-intense lasers and ultimately to the advanced control of relativistic motion of matter with femtosecond laser beams structured in space&#8211;time.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""LIDYL, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CEA Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, 91 191, France"", ""authors"": [""G.

article,Two-photon direct laser writing of ultracompact multi-lens objectives,"<p>Current lens systems are restricted in size, shape and dimensions by limitations of manufacturing. Multi-lens elements with non-spherical shapes are required for high optical performance and to correct for aberrations when imaging at wide angles and large fields. Here we present a novel concept in optics that overcomes all of the aforementioned difficulties and opens the new field of 3D printed micro- and nano-optics with complex lens designs. We demonstrate the complete process chain, from optical design, manufacturing by femtosecond two-photon direct laser writing and testing to the application of multi-lens objectives with sizes around 100&#8197;&#181;m, and validate their high performance and functionality by quantitative measurements of the modulation transfer function and aberrations. The unprecedented flexibility of our method paves the way towards printed optical miniature instruments such as endoscopes, fibre-imaging systems for cell biology, new illumination systems, miniature optical fibre traps, integrated quantum emitters and detectors, and miniature drones and robots with autonomous vision.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""4th Physics Institute and Research Center SCoPE, University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 57, Stuttgart, 70569, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Timo Gissibl"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Harald Giessen""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Applied Optics (ITO) and Research Center SCoPE, University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 9, Stuttgart, 70569, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Simon Thiele"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Alois Herkommer""]}]",False,"[""Timo Gissibl"", ""Simon Thiele"", ""Alois Herkommer"", ""Harald Giessen""]","Gissibl, T., Thiele, S., Herkommer, A. et al.
