article,Resolved-sideband Raman cooling of an optical phonon in semiconductor materials,"<p>The radiation pressure of light has been widely used to cool trapped atoms or the mechanical vibrational modes of optomechanical systems. Recently, by using the electrostrictive forces of light, spontaneous Brillouin cooling and stimulated Brillouin excitation of acoustic modes of the whispering-gallery-type resonator have been demonstrated. The laser cooling of specific lattice vibrations in solids (that is, phonons) proposed by Dykman in the late 1970s, however, still remains sparsely investigated. Here, we demonstrate the first strong spontaneous Raman cooling and heating of a longitudinal optical phonon (LOP) with a 6.23&#8197;THz frequency in polar semiconductor zinc telluride nanobelts. We use the exciton to resonate and assist photoelastic Raman scattering from the LOPs caused by a strong exciton&#8211;LOP coupling. By detuning the laser pump to a lower (higher) energy-resolved sideband to make a spontaneous scattering photon resonate with an exciton at an anti-Stokes (Stokes) frequency, the dipole oscillation of the LOPs is photoelastically attenuated (enhanced) to a colder (hotter) state.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Division of Physics and Applied Physics, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 637371, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Jun Zhang"", "",\u00a0Qing Zhang"", "",\u00a0Xingzhi Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Qihua Xiong""]}, {""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of Superlattices and Microstructures, Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100083, China"", ""authors"": [""Jun Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 2, Singapore, 117543, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Leong Chuan Kwek""]}, {""address"": ""National Institute of Education and Institute of Advanced Studies, Nanyang Technological University, 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore, 637616, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Leong Chuan Kwek""]}, {""address"": ""MajuLab, CNRS-UNS-NUS-NTU International Joint Research Unit, UMI 3654, Singapore, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Leong Chuan Kwek"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Qihua Xiong""]}, {""address"": ""NOVITAS, Nanoelectronics Center of Excellence, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Qihua Xiong""]}]",False,"[""Jun Zhang"", ""Qing Zhang"", ""Xingzhi Wang"", ""Leong Chuan Kwek"", ""Qihua Xiong""]","Zhang, J., Zhang, Q., Wang, X. et al.

article,High-resolution adaptive imaging of a single atom,"<p>Optical imaging systems are used extensively in the life and physical sciences because of their ability to non-invasively capture details on the microscopic and nanoscopic scales. Such systems are often limited by source or detector noise, image distortions and human operator misjudgement. Here, we report a general, quantitative method to analyse and correct these errors. We use this method to identify and correct optical aberrations in an imaging system for single atoms and realize an atomic position sensitivity of &#8764;0.5&#8197;nm&#8197;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> with a minimum uncertainty of 1.7&#8197;nm, allowing the direct imaging of atomic motion. This is the highest position sensitivity ever measured for an isolated atom and opens up the possibility of performing out-of-focus three-dimensional particle tracking, imaging of atoms in three-dimensional optical lattices or sensing forces at the yoctonewton (10<sup>&#8722;24</sup>&#8197;N) scale.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""and Department of Physics, Joint Quantum Institute, Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, 20742, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""J.

article,Power conversion efficiency exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit in a ferroelectric insulator,"<p>Ferroelectric absorbers, which promote carrier separation and exhibit above-gap photovoltages, are attractive candidates for constructing efficient solar cells. Using the ferroelectric insulator BaTiO<sub>3</sub> we show how photogeneration and the collection of hot, non-equilibrium electrons through the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) yields a greater-than-unity quantum efficiency. Despite absorbing less than a tenth of the solar spectrum, the power conversion efficiency of the BPVE device under 1 sun illumination exceeds the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit for a material of this bandgap. We present data for devices that feature a single-tip electrode contact and an array with 24 tips (total planar area of 1&#8197;&#215;&#8197;1&#8197;&#956;m<sup>2</sup>) capable of generating a current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8197;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup> under illumination of AM1.5&#8197;G.
