article,Measuring subwavelength spatial coherence with plasmonic interferometry,"<p>Optical interferometry has enabled quantification of the spatial and temporal correlations of electromagnetic fields, which laid the foundations for the theory of optical coherence. Despite significant advances in fundamental theories and applications, the measurement of nanoscale coherence lengths for highly incoherent optical fields has remained elusive. Here, we employ plasmonic interferometry (that is, optical interferometry with surface plasmons) to characterize the spatial degree of coherence of light beams down to subwavelength scales, with measured coherence lengths as low as &#8764;330&#8197;nm for an incident wavelength of 500&#8197;nm. Furthermore, we demonstrate a compact coherence meter that integrates this method with an image sensor. Precise determination of spatial coherence can advance high-resolution imaging and tomographic schemes, and provide an experimental platform for the development and testing of optical coherence theories at the nanoscale.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Engineering, Brown University, Rhode Island, Providence, 02912, USA"", ""authors"": [""Drew Morrill"", "",\u00a0Dongfang Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Domenico Pacifici""]}]",False,"[""Drew Morrill"", ""Dongfang Li"", ""Domenico Pacifici""]","Morrill, D., Li, D. & Pacifici, D.
