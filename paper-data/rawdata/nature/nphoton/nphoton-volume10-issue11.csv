article,Fully integrated quantum photonic circuit with an electrically driven light source,"<p>Photonic quantum technologies allow quantum phenomena to be exploited in applications such as quantum cryptography, quantum simulation and quantum computation. A key requirement for practical devices is the scalable integration of single-photon sources, detectors and linear optical elements on a common platform. Nanophotonic circuits enable the realization of complex linear optical systems, while non-classical light can be measured with waveguide-integrated detectors. However, reproducible single-photon sources with high brightness and compatibility with photonic devices remain elusive for fully integrated systems. Here, we report the observation of antibunching in the light emitted from an electrically driven carbon nanotube embedded within a photonic quantum circuit. Non-classical light generated on chip is recorded under cryogenic conditions with waveguide-integrated superconducting single-photon detectors, without requiring optical filtering. Because exclusively scalable fabrication and deposition methods are used, our results establish carbon nanotubes as promising nanoscale single-photon emitters for hybrid quantum photonic devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, 76021, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Svetlana Khasminskaya"", "",\u00a0Felix Pyatkov"", "",\u00a0Simone Ferrari"", "",\u00a0Oliver Kahl"", "",\u00a0Vadim Kovalyuk"", "",\u00a0Patrik Rath"", "",\u00a0Andreas Vetter"", "",\u00a0Frank Hennrich"", "",\u00a0Manfred M.

article,Optical observation of single atomic ions interacting with plasmonic nanorods in aqueous solution,"<p>Plasmonic nanoparticles provide the basis for a multitude of applications in chemistry, health care and optics because of their unique properties. Nanoparticle-based techniques have evolved into powerful tools for studying molecular interactions with single-molecule resolution. Here we show that this sensing capability can be used to detect single atomic ions in aqueous medium. We monitored interactions of single zinc and mercury ions with plasmonic gold nanorods (NRs) resonantly coupled to our whispering gallery mode sensor. Our system's ability to discern permanent binding and transient interaction allows us to study the different interaction kinetics of both ion species. The detection of transient interactions enables us to confirm statistically that the sensor signals originate from single ions. Furthermore, we reveal how the ion&#8211;NR interactions evolve with respect to the medium's ionic strength as mercury ions amalgamate with gold and zinc ions eventually turn into probes of highly localized surface potentials.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, G\u00fcnther-Scharowsky-Stra\u00dfe 1, Erlangen, 91058, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Martin D.

article,An ultrawide-bandwidth single-sideband modulator for terahertz frequencies,"<p>Wireless high-speed data communication using terahertz (THz) carrier frequencies is becoming reality with data rates beyond 100&#8197;Gbit s<sup>&#8211;1</sup>. Many of the mobile applications use internet access and require that THz wireless base stations are connected to a global network, such as the radio-over-fibre network. We present the realization of an ultrawide bandwidth THz optical single-sideband (OSSB) modulator for converting (free-space) THz signals to THz optical modulations with an increased spectral efficiency. THz OSSB will mitigate chromatic dispersion-induced propagation losses in optical fibres and support digital modulation schemes. We demonstrate THz OSSB for free-space radiation between 0.3 and 1.0&#8197;THz using a specially designed dichroic beamsplitter for signal and carrier, and a planar light-wave circuit with multimode interference structures. This arrangement of optical elements mimics the Hartley single-sideband modulator for electronics signals and accomplishes the required Hilbert transform without any frequency-dependent tuning element over an ultrawide THz spectrum.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Molecules and Materials, FELIX Laboratory, Radboud University, Toernooiveld 7c, Nijmegen, 6525 ED, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""A.

article,Fresh-slice multicolour X-ray free-electron lasers,"<p>X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) provide femtosecond X-ray pulses with a narrow energy bandwidth and unprecedented brightness. Ultrafast physical and chemical dynamics, initiated with a site-specific X-ray pulse, can be explored using XFELs with a second ultrashort X-ray probe pulse. However, existing double-pulse schemes are complicated, difficult to customize or provide only low-intensity pulses. Here we present the novel fresh-slice technique for multicolour pulse production, wherein different temporal slices of an electron bunch lase to saturation in separate undulator sections. This method combines electron bunch tailoring from a passive wakefield device with trajectory control to provide multicolour pulses. The fresh-slice scheme outperforms existing techniques at soft X-ray wavelengths. It produces femtosecond pulses with a power of tens of gigawatts and flexible colour separation. The pulse delay can be varied from temporal overlap to almost one picosecond. We also demonstrate the first three-colour XFEL and variably polarized two-colour pulses.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, 2575 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, 94025, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alberto A.
