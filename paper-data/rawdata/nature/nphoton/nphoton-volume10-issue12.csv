article,Self-organized instability in graded-index multimode fibres,"<p>Multimode fibres (MMFs) are attracting interest in the study of spatiotemporal dynamics as well as in the context of ultrafast fibre sources, imaging and telecommunications. This interest stems from three differences compared with single-mode fibre structures: their spatiotemporal complexity (information capacity), the role of disorder, and their complex intermodal interactions. To date, MMFs have been studied in limiting cases in which one or more of these properties can be neglected. Here, we study a regime in which all these elements are integral. We observe a spatial beam-cleaning phenomenon that precedes spatiotemporal modulation instability. We provide evidence that the origin of these processes is a universal unstable attractor in graded-index MMFs. The self-organization and instability of the attractor are both caused by intermodal interactions characterized by cooperating disorder, nonlinearity and dissipation. Disorder-enhanced nonlinear processes in MMFs have important implications for future telecommunications, and the multifaceted nature of the considered dynamics showcases MMFs as potential laboratories for a variety of topics in complexity science.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14853, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Logan G.

article,Near-unity quantum efficiency of broadband black silicon photodiodes with an induced junction,"<p>Ideal photodiodes can detect all incoming photons independently of the wavelength, angle or intensity of the incident light. Present-day photodiodes notably suffer from optical losses and generated charge carriers are often lost via recombination. Here, we demonstrate a device with an external quantum efficiency above 96% over the wavelength range 250&#8211;950&#8197;nm. Instead of a conventional p&#8211;n junction, we use negatively charged alumina to form an inversion layer that generates a collecting junction extending to a depth of 30&#8197;&#181;m in n-type silicon with bulk resistivity larger than 10&#8197;k&#937;&#8201;cm. We enhance the collection efficiency further by nanostructuring the photodiode surface, which results in higher effective charge density and increased charge-carrier concentration in the inversion layer. Additionally, nanostructuring and efficient surface passivation allow for a reliable device response with incident angles up to 70&#176;. We expect the considered device to improve data quality, reduce the area of photodiodes as well as decrease the cost per pixel.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Micro and Nanosciences, Aalto University, Tietotie 3, Espoo, 02150, Finland"", ""authors"": [""Mikko A.

article,Selective carrier injection into patterned arrays of pyramidal quantum dots for entangled photon light-emitting diodes,"<p>Scalability and foundry compatibility (as apply to conventional silicon-based integrated computer processors, for example) in developing quantum technologies are major challenges facing current research. Here we introduce a quantum photonic technology that has the potential to enable the large-scale fabrication of semiconductor-based, site-controlled, scalable arrays of electrically driven sources of polarization-entangled photons that may be able to encode quantum information. The design of the sources is based on quantum dots grown in micrometre-sized pyramidal recesses along the crystallographic direction (111)B, which theoretically ensures high symmetry of the quantum dots&#8212;a requirement for bright entangled-photon emission. A selective electric injection scheme in these non-planar structures allows a high density of light-emitting diodes to be obtained, with some producing entangled photon pairs that also violate Bell's inequality. Compatibility with semiconductor fabrication technology, good reproducibility and lithographic position control make these devices attractive candidates for integrated photonic circuits for quantum information processing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Tyndall National Institute, University College Cork, Lee Maltings, Cork, Ireland"", ""authors"": [""T.

article,Optical microresonators as single-particle absorption spectrometers,"<p>Optical measurements of nanoscale objects offer major insights into fundamental biological, material and photonic properties. In absorption spectroscopy, sensitivity limits applications at the nanoscale. Here, we present a new single-particle double-modulation photothermal absorption spectroscopy method that employs on-chip optical whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonators as ultrasensitive thermometers. Optical excitation of a nanoscale object on the microresonator produces increased local temperatures that are proportional to the absorption cross-section of the object. We resolve photothermal shifts in the resonance frequency of the microresonator that are smaller than 100&#8197;Hz, orders of magnitude smaller than previous WGM sensing schemes. The application of our new technique to single gold nanorods reveals a dense array of sharp Fano resonances arising from the coupling between the localized surface plasmon of the gold nanorod and the WGMs of the resonator, allowing for the exploration of plasmonic&#8211;photonic hybridization. In terms of the wider applicability, our approach adds label-free spectroscopic identification to microresonator-based detection schemes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Madison, 53706, Wisconsin, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kevin D.

article,Lasing and anti-lasing in a single cavity,"<p>Lasing, light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, is a key attribute for many important applications in optical communications, medicine and defence. Conversely, anti-lasing represents the time-reversed counterpart of laser emission, where incoming radiation is coherently absorbed. Here, we experimentally realize lasing and anti-lasing at the same frequency in a single cavity using parity&#8211;time symmetry. Because of the time-reversal property, the demonstrated lasing and anti-lasing resonances share common resonant features such as identical frequency dependence, coherent in-phase response and fine spectral resolution.

article,High-magnification super-resolution FINCH microscopy using birefringent crystal lens interferometers,"<p>Fresnel incoherent correlation holography (FINCH) microscopy is a promising approach for high-resolution biological imaging but has so far been limited to use with low-magnification, low-numerical-aperture configurations. We report the use of in-line incoherent interferometers made from uniaxial birefringent &#945;-barium borate (&#945;-BBO) or calcite crystals that overcome the aberrations and distortions present with previous implementations that employed spatial light modulators or gradient refractive index lenses. FINCH microscopy incorporating these birefringent elements and high-numerical-aperture oil immersion objectives could outperform standard wide-field fluorescence microscopy, with, for example, a 149&#8197;nm lateral point spread function at a wavelength of 590&#8197;nm. Enhanced resolution was confirmed with sub-resolution fluorescent beads. Taking the Golgi apparatus as a biological example, three different proteins labelled with GFP and two other fluorescent dyes in HeLa cells were resolved with an image quality that is comparable to similar samples captured by structured illumination microscopy.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 9605 Medical Center Drive Suite 240, Rockville, 20850, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nisan Siegel"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gary Brooker""]}, {""address"": ""Microscopy Center, Johns Hopkins University Montgomery County Campus, Rockville, 20850, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nisan Siegel"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gary Brooker""]}, {""address"": ""CellOptic, Inc., 9605 Medical Center Drive Suite 224, Rockville, 20850, Maryland, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nisan Siegel"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gary Brooker""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Arkansas for Medical Science, 4301 West Markham Street, Little Rock, 72205, Arkansas, USA"", ""authors"": [""Vladimir Lupashin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Brian Storrie""]}]",False,"[""Nisan Siegel"", ""Vladimir Lupashin"", ""Brian Storrie"", ""Gary Brooker""]","Siegel, N., Lupashin, V., Storrie, B. et al.

article,A flexible and wearable terahertz scanner,"<p>Imaging technologies based on terahertz (THz) waves have great potential for use in powerful non-invasive inspection methods. However, most real objects have various three-dimensional curvatures and existing THz technologies often encounter difficulties in imaging such configurations, which limits the useful range of THz imaging applications. Here, we report the development of a flexible and wearable THz scanner based on carbon nanotubes. We achieved room-temperature THz detection over a broad frequency band ranging from 0.14 to 39&#8197;THz and developed a portable THz scanner. Using this scanner, we performed THz imaging of samples concealed behind opaque objects, breakages and metal impurities of a bent film and multi-view scans of a syringe. We demonstrated a passive biometric THz scan of a human hand. Our results are expected to have considerable implications for non-destructive and non-contact inspections, such as medical examinations for the continuous monitoring of health conditions.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratory for Future Interdisciplinary Research of Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 152-8552, Japan"", ""authors"": [""D.
