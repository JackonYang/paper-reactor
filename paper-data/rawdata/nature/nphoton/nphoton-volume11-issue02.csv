article,Polarization domain walls in optical fibres as topological bits for data transmission,"<p>Domain walls are topological defects that occur at symmetry-breaking phase transitions. Although domain walls have been intensively studied in ferromagnetic materials, where they nucleate at the boundary of neighbouring regions of oppositely aligned magnetic dipoles, their equivalents in optics have not been fully explored so far. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the existence of a universal class of polarization domain walls in the form of localized polarization knots in conventional optical fibres. We exploit their binding properties for optical data transmission beyond the Kerr limits of normally dispersive fibres. In particular, we demonstrate how trapping energy in a well-defined train of polarization domain walls allows undistorted propagation of polarization knots at a rate of 28&#8197;GHz along a 10&#8197;km length of normally dispersive optical fibre. These results constitute the first experimental observation of kink&#8211;antikink solitary wave propagation in nonlinear fibre optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire Carnot de Bourgogne (ICB), UMR 6303 CNRS - Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9, 9 Avenue Alain Savary, BP 47870, Dijon, 21078, France"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Efficient perovskite light-emitting diodes featuring nanometre-sized crystallites,"<p>Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are emerging as highly attractive semiconductors for use in optoelectronics. In addition to their use in photovoltaics, perovskites are promising for realizing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their high colour purity, low non-radiative recombination rates and tunable bandgap. Here, we report highly efficient perovskite LEDs enabled through the formation of self-assembled, nanometre-sized crystallites. Large-group ammonium halides added to the perovskite precursor solution act as a surfactant that dramatically constrains the growth of 3D perovskite grains during film forming, producing crystallites with dimensions as small as 10&#8197;nm and film roughness of less than 1&#8197;nm. Coating these nanometre-sized perovskite grains with longer-chain organic cations yields highly efficient emitters, resulting in LEDs that operate with external quantum efficiencies of 10.4% for the methylammonium lead iodide system and 9.3% for the methylammonium lead bromide system, with significantly improved shelf and operational stability.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, 08544, New Jersey, USA"", ""authors"": [""Zhengguo Xiao"", "",\u00a0Ross A.

article,Scattering compensation by focus scanning holographic aberration probing (F-SHARP),"<p>A long-standing goal in biomedical imaging, the control of light inside turbid media, requires knowledge of how the phase and amplitude of an illuminating wavefront are transformed as the electric field propagates inside a scattering sample onto a target plane. So far, it has proved challenging to non-invasively characterize the scattered optical wavefront inside a disordered medium. Here, we present a non-invasive scattering compensation method, termed F-SHARP, which allows us to measure the scattered electric-field point spread function (E-field PSF) in three dimensions. Knowledge of the phase and amplitude of the E-field PSF makes it possible to optically cancel sample turbulence. We demonstrate the imaging capabilities of this technique on a variety of samples and notably through vertebrate brains and across thinned skull in vivo.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Bioimaging and Neurophotonics Lab, NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence, Charit\u00e9 Berlin, Humboldt University, Charit\u00e9platz 1, Berlin, 10117, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Ioannis N.

article,A monolithic integrated photonic microwave filter,"<p>Meeting the increasing demand for capacity in wireless networks requires the harnessing of higher regions in the radiofrequency spectrum, reducing cell size, as well as more compact, agile and power-efficient base stations that are capable of smoothly interfacing the radio and fibre segments. Fully functional microwave photonic chips are promising candidates in attempts to meet these goals. In recent years, many integrated microwave photonic chips have been reported in different technologies. To the best of our knowledge, none has monolithically integrated all the main active and passive optoelectronic components. Here, we report the first demonstration of a tunable microwave photonics filter that is monolithically integrated into an indium phosphide chip. The reconfigurable radiofrequency photonic filter includes all the necessary elements (for example, lasers, modulators and photodetectors), and its response can be tuned by means of control electric currents. This is an important step in demonstrating the feasibility of integrated and programmable microwave photonic processors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ITEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, 46022, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Javier S.

article,Three-dimensional all-dielectric photonic topological insulator,"<p>The discovery of two-dimensional topological photonic systems has transformed our views on the propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves, and the quest for similar states in three dimensions is open. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that it is possible to design symmetry-protected three-dimensional topological states in an all-dielectric platform, with the electromagnetic duality between electric and magnetic fields being ensured by the structure design. Magneto-electrical coupling plays the role of a synthetic gauge field that determines a topological transition to an &#8216;insulating&#8217; regime with a complete three-dimensional photonic bandgap. We reveal the emergence of surface states with conical Dirac dispersion and spin-locking, and we numerically confirm robust propagation of the surface states along two-dimensional domain walls with first-principles studies. The proposed system represents a table-top platform capable of emulating the relativistic dynamics of massive Dirac fermions and the surface states can be interpreted as Jackiw&#8211;Rebbi states bound to the interface separating domains with particles of opposite masses.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Grove School of Engineering, The City College of the City University of New York, 140th Street and Convent Avenue, New York, 10031, New York, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alexey Slobozhanyuk"", "",\u00a0Xiang Ni"", "",\u00a0Daria Smirnova"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Alexander B.
