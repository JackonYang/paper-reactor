article,Background suppression in fluorescence nanoscopy with stimulated emission double depletion,"<p>Stimulated emission depletion (STED) fluorescence nanoscopy is a powerful super-resolution imaging technique based on the confinement of fluorescence emission to the central subregion of an observation volume through de-excitation of fluorophores in the periphery via stimulated emission. Here, we introduce stimulated emission double depletion (STEDD) as a method to selectively remove artificial background intensity. In this approach, a first, conventional STED pulse is followed by a second, delayed Gaussian STED pulse that specifically depletes the central region, thus leaving only background. Thanks to time-resolved detection we can remove this background intensity voxel by voxel by taking the weighted difference of photons collected before and after the second STED pulse. STEDD thus yields background-suppressed super-resolved images as well as STED-based fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data. Furthermore, the proposed method is also beneficial when considering lower-power, less redshifted depletion pulses.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Nanotechnology, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, 76344, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Peng Gao"", "",\u00a0Lu Zhou"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0G.

article,Coherent backscattering of Raman light,"<p>Coherent backscattering of light is observed when electromagnetic waves undergo multiple scattering within a disordered optical medium. So far, coherent backscattering of light has been studied extensively for elastic (or Rayleigh) light scattering. The occurrence of inelastic scattering affects the visibility of the backscattering effect by reducing the degree of optical coherence in the diffusion process. Here, we discuss the first experimental observation of a constructive interference effect in the inelastically backscattered Raman radiation from strongly diffusing silicon nanowire random media. The observed phenomenon originates from the coherent nature of the Raman scattering process, which typically occurs on a scale given by the phonon coherence length. We interpret our results in the context of a theoretical model of mixed Rayleigh&#8211;Raman random walks to shed light on the role of phase coherence in multiple scattering phenomena.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CNR-IPCF, viale F.

article,Highly efficient luminescent solar concentrators based on earth-abundant indirect-bandgap silicon quantum dots,"<p>Building-integrated photovoltaics is gaining consensus as a renewable energy technology for producing electricity at the point of use. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) could extend architectural integration to the urban environment by realizing electrode-less photovoltaic windows. Crucial for large-area LSCs is the suppression of reabsorption losses, which requires emitters with negligible overlap between their absorption and emission spectra. Here, we demonstrate the use of indirect-bandgap semiconductor nanostructures such as highly emissive silicon quantum dots. Silicon is non-toxic, low-cost and ultra-earth-abundant, which avoids the limitations to the industrial scaling of quantum dots composed of low-abundance elements. Suppressed reabsorption and scattering losses lead to nearly ideal LSCs with an optical efficiency of &#951;&#8201;=&#8201;2.85%, matching state-of-the-art semi-transparent LSCs. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that optimized silicon quantum dot LSCs have a clear path to &#951;&#8201;&gt;&#8201;5% for 1&#8197;m<sup>2</sup> devices. We are finally able to realize flexible LSCs with performances comparable to those of flat concentrators, which opens the way to a new design freedom for building-integrated photovoltaics elements.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Dipartimento di Scienza dei Materiali, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, via Cozzi 55, Milano, IT-20125, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Francesco Meinardi"", "",\u00a0Lorena Dhamo"", "",\u00a0Francesco Carulli"", "",\u00a0Michele Mauri"", "",\u00a0Francesco Bruni"", "",\u00a0Roberto Simonutti"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sergio Brovelli""]}, {""address"": ""Glass to Power Srl, Via Monte Nero 66, Milano, IT-20135, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Francesco Meinardi"", "",\u00a0Michele Mauri"", "",\u00a0Francesco Bruni"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sergio Brovelli""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, High Temperature and Plasma Laboratory, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 55455, Minnesota, USA"", ""authors"": [""Samantha Ehrenberg"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Uwe Kortshagen""]}]",False,"[""Francesco Meinardi"", ""Samantha Ehrenberg"", ""Lorena Dhamo"", ""Francesco Carulli"", ""Michele Mauri"", ""Francesco Bruni"", ""Roberto Simonutti"", ""Uwe Kortshagen"", ""Sergio Brovelli""]","Meinardi, F., Ehrenberg, S., Dhamo, L. et al.

article,Ultrahigh-definition dynamic 3D holographic display by active control of volume speckle fields,"<p>Holographic displays generate realistic 3D images that can be viewed without the need for any visual aids. They operate by generating carefully tailored light fields that replicate how humans see an actual environment. However, the realization of high-performance, dynamic 3D holographic displays has been hindered by the capabilities of present wavefront modulator technology. In particular, spatial light modulators have a small diffraction angle range and limited pixel number limiting the viewing angle and image size of a holographic 3D display. Here, we present an alternative method to generate dynamic 3D images by controlling volume speckle fields significantly enhancing image definition. We use this approach to demonstrate a dynamic display of micrometre-sized optical foci in a volume of 8&#8201;mm&#8201;&#215;&#8201;8&#8201;mm&#8201;&#215;&#8201;20&#8197;mm.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Hyeonseung Yu"", "",\u00a0KyeoReh Lee"", "",\u00a0Jongchan Park"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0YongKeun Park""]}, {""address"": ""KAIST Institute for Health Science and Technology, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Hyeonseung Yu"", "",\u00a0KyeoReh Lee"", "",\u00a0Jongchan Park"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0YongKeun Park""]}]",False,"[""Hyeonseung Yu"", ""KyeoReh Lee"", ""Jongchan Park"", ""YongKeun Park""]","Yu, H., Lee, K., Park, J. et al.

article,Charge-integrating organic heterojunction phototransistors for wide-dynamic-range image sensors,"<p>Solution-processed phototransistors can substantially advance the performance of image sensors. Phototransistors exhibit large photoconductive gain and a sublinear responsivity to irradiance, which enables a logarithmic sensing of irradiance that is akin to the human eye and has a wider dynamic range than photodiode-based image sensors. Here, we present a novel solution-processed phototransistor composed of a heterostructure between a high-mobility organic semiconductor and an organic bulk heterojunction. The device efficiently integrates photogenerated charge during the period of a video frame then quickly discharges it, which significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio compared with sampling photocurrent during readout. Phototransistor-based image sensors processed without photolithography on plastic substrates integrate charge with external quantum efficiencies above 100% at 100 frames per second. In addition, the sublinear responsivity to irradiance of these devices enables a wide dynamic range of 103 dB at 30 frames per second, which is competitive with state-of-the-art image sensors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, 94720, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""Adrien Pierre"", "",\u00a0Abhinav Gaikwad"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ana Claudia Arias""]}]",False,"[""Adrien Pierre"", ""Abhinav Gaikwad"", ""Ana Claudia Arias""]","Pierre, A., Gaikwad, A. & Arias, A.
