article,Femtosecond-laser-driven wire-guided helical undulator for intense terahertz radiation,"<p>The capability of synchrotron radiation to produce ultrabright emission has attracted considerable interest over the last half a century. To date, magnetic undulators with a period of several centimetres are commonly used for wiggling relativistic electrons in a modulated field. Here, we propose a novel compact undulator with a period down to the submillimetre level based on a spontaneous electric field that is driven by a femtosecond laser. Both the guided energetic electrons and the gyrotron-like undulator are spontaneously produced by irradiating a thin metallic wire with an intense laser pulse. An intense radial electric field instantaneously created on the wire can guide the electrons' helical motion along the wire and induce periodic THz emission. We have demonstrated that this scheme can produce intense THz sources with a conversion efficiency of 1% that are frequency-tunable by adjusting the diameter of the wire. Amplified emission of THz radiation by more than tenfold has been observed.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of High Field Laser Physics, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 201800, China"", ""authors"": [""Ye Tian"", "",\u00a0Jiansheng Liu"", "",\u00a0Yafeng Bai"", "",\u00a0Shiyi Zhou"", "",\u00a0Haiyi Sun"", "",\u00a0Ruxin Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zhizhan Xu""]}, {""address"": ""Collaborative Innovation Center of IFSA, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China"", ""authors"": [""Jiansheng Liu"", "",\u00a0Ruxin Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zhizhan Xu""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Modern Optics, Nankai University, Key Laboratory of Optical Information Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin, 300071, China"", ""authors"": [""Weiwei Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jiayu Zhao""]}, {""address"": ""University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China"", ""authors"": [""Ruxin Li""]}, {""address"": ""School of Physical Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, 20031, China"", ""authors"": [""Ruxin Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zhizhan Xu""]}]",False,"[""Ye Tian"", ""Jiansheng Liu"", ""Yafeng Bai"", ""Shiyi Zhou"", ""Haiyi Sun"", ""Weiwei Liu"", ""Jiayu Zhao"", ""Ruxin Li"", ""Zhizhan Xu""]","Tian, Y., Liu, J., Bai, Y. et al.

article,Single-photon imager based on a superconducting nanowire delay line,"<p>Detecting spatial and temporal information of individual photons is critical to applications in spectroscopy, communication, biological imaging, astronomical observation and quantum-information processing. Here we demonstrate a scalable single-photon imager using a single continuous superconducting nanowire that is not only a single-photon detector but also functions as an efficient microwave delay line. In this context, photon-detection pulses are guided in the nanowire and enable the readout of the position and time of photon-absorption events from the arrival times of the detection pulses at the nanowire's two ends. Experimentally, we slowed down the velocity of pulse propagation to &#8764;2% of the speed of light in free space. In a 19.7&#8197;mm long nanowire that meandered across an area of 286&#8201;&#215;&#8201;193&#8197;&#956;m<sup>2</sup>, we were able to resolve &#8764;590 effective pixels with a temporal resolution of 50&#8197;ps (full width at half maximum).

article,Space–time control of free induction decay in the extreme ultraviolet,"<p>Ultrafast extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray sources are revolutionizing our ability to follow femtosecond processes with &#229;ngstr&#246;m-scale resolution. The next frontier is to simultaneously control the direction, duration and timing of such radiation. Here, we demonstrate a fully functional opto-optical modulator for XUV light, similar to modulators available at infrared (IR) and visible wavelengths. It works by using an IR pulse to control the spatial and spectral phase of the free induction decay that results from using attosecond pulses to excite a gas. The modulator allows us to send the XUV light in a direction of our choosing at a time of our choosing. The inherent synchronization of the XUV emission to the control pulse will allow laser-pump/X-ray probe experiments with sub-femtosecond time resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Lund University, PO Box 118, Lund, SE-221 00, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""S.

article,Subwavelength coherent imaging of periodic samples using a 13.5 nm tabletop high-harmonic light source,"<p>Coherent diffractive imaging is unique, being the only route for achieving high spatial resolution in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regions, limited only by the wavelength of the light. Recently, advances in coherent short-wavelength light sources, coupled with progress in algorithm development, have significantly enhanced the power of X-ray imaging. However, so far, high-fidelity diffraction imaging of periodic objects has been a challenge because the scattered light is concentrated in isolated peaks. Here, we use tabletop 13.5&#8197;nm high-harmonic beams to make two significant advances. First, we demonstrate high-quality imaging of an extended, nearly periodic sample for the first time. Second, we achieve subwavelength spatial resolution (12.6&#8197;nm) imaging at short wavelengths, also for the first time. The key to both advances is a novel technique called &#8216;modulus enforced probe&#8217;, which enables robust and quantitative reconstructions of periodic objects.
