article,Photon-trapping microstructures enable high-speed high-efficiency silicon photodiodes,"<p>High-speed, high-efficiency photodetectors play an important role in optical communication links that are increasingly being used in data centres to handle higher volumes of data traffic and higher bandwidths, as big data and cloud computing continue to grow exponentially. Monolithic integration of optical components with signal-processing electronics on a single silicon chip is of paramount importance in the drive to reduce cost and improve performance. We report the first demonstration of micro- and nanoscale holes enabling light trapping in a silicon photodiode, which exhibits an ultrafast impulse response (full-width at half-maximum) of 30&#8197;ps and a high efficiency of more than 50%, for use in data-centre optical communications. The photodiode uses micro- and nanostructured holes to enhance, by an order of magnitude, the absorption efficiency of a thin intrinsic layer of less than 2&#8197;&#181;m thickness and is designed for a data rate of 20&#8197;gigabits per second or higher at a wavelength of 850&#8197;nm.

article,Optical holonomic single quantum gates with a geometric spin under a zero field,"<p>The realization of fast fault-tolerant quantum gates on a single spin is the core requirement for solid-state quantum-information processing. As polarized light shows geometric interference, spin coherence is also geometrically controlled with light via the spin&#8211;orbit interaction. Here, we show that a geometric spin in a degenerate subspace of a spin-1 electronic system under a zero field in a nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond allows implementation of optical non-adiabatic holonomic quantum gates. The geometric spin under quasi-resonant light exposure undergoes a cyclic evolution in the spin&#8211;orbit space, and acquires a geometric phase or holonomy that results in rotations about an arbitrary axis by any angle defined by the light polarization and detuning. This enables universal holonomic quantum gates with a single operation. We demonstrate a complete set of Pauli quantum gates using the geometric spin preparation and readout techniques. The new scheme opens a path to holonomic quantum computers and repeaters.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Yokohama National University, 79-5 Tokiwadai, Hodogaya, 240-8501, Yokohama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Yuhei Sekiguchi"", "",\u00a0Naeko Niikura"", "",\u00a0Ryota Kuroiwa"", "",\u00a0Hiroki Kano"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hideo Kosaka""]}]",False,"[""Yuhei Sekiguchi"", ""Naeko Niikura"", ""Ryota Kuroiwa"", ""Hiroki Kano"", ""Hideo Kosaka""]","Sekiguchi, Y., Niikura, N., Kuroiwa, R. et al.

article,Monolithic integration of hybrid perovskite single crystals with heterogenous substrate for highly sensitive X-ray imaging,"<p>The monolithic integration of new optoelectronic materials with well-established inexpensive silicon circuitry is leading to new applications, functionality and simple readouts. Here, we show that single crystals of hybrid perovskites can be integrated onto virtually any substrates, including silicon wafers, through facile, low-temperature, solution-processed molecular bonding. The brominated (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane molecule binds the native oxide of silicon and participates in the perovskite crystal with its ammonium bromide group, yielding a solid mechanical and electrical connection. The dipole of the bonding molecule reduces device noise while retaining signal intensity. The reduction of dark current enables the detectors to be operated at increased bias, resulting in a sensitivity of 2.1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>4</sup>&#8197;&#181;C&#8197;Gy<sub>air</sub><sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8197;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> under 8&#8197;keV X-ray radiation, which is over a thousand times higher than the sensitivity of amorphous selenium detectors.

article,Chip-based wide field-of-view nanoscopy,"<p>Present optical nanoscopy techniques use a complex microscope for imaging and a simple glass slide to hold the sample. Here, we demonstrate the inverse: the use of a complex, but mass-producible optical chip, which hosts the sample and provides a waveguide for the illumination source, and a standard low-cost microscope to acquire super-resolved images via two different approaches. Waveguides composed of a material with high refractive-index contrast provide a strong evanescent field that is used for single-molecule switching and fluorescence excitation, thus enabling chip-based single-molecule localization microscopy. Additionally, multimode interference patterns induce spatial fluorescence intensity variations that enable fluctuation-based super-resolution imaging. As chip-based nanoscopy separates the illumination and detection light paths, total-internal-reflection fluorescence excitation is possible over a large field of view, with up to 0.5&#8197;mm&#8201;&#215;&#8201;0.5&#8197;mm being demonstrated.
