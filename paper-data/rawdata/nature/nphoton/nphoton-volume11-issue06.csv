article,High-efficiency multiphoton boson sampling,"<p>Boson sampling is considered as a strong candidate to demonstrate &#8216;quantum computational supremacy&#8217; over classical computers. However, previous proof-of-principle experiments suffered from small photon number and low sampling rates owing to the inefficiencies of the single-photon sources and multiport optical interferometers. Here, we develop two central components for high-performance boson sampling: robust multiphoton interferometers with 99% transmission rate and actively demultiplexed single-photon sources based on a quantum dot&#8211;micropillar with simultaneously high efficiency, purity and indistinguishability. We implement and validate three-, four- and five-photon boson sampling, and achieve sampling rates of 4.96&#8197;kHz, 151&#8197;Hz and 4&#8197;Hz, respectively, which are over 24,000 times faster than previous experiments. Our architecture can be scaled up for a larger number of photons and with higher sampling rates to compete with classical computers, and might provide experimental evidence against the extended Church&#8211;Turing thesis.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Shanghai Branch, Shanghai, 201315, China"", ""authors"": [""Hui Wang"", "",\u00a0Yu He"", "",\u00a0Yu-Huai Li"", "",\u00a0Zu-En Su"", "",\u00a0Bo Li"", "",\u00a0He-Liang Huang"", "",\u00a0Xing Ding"", "",\u00a0Ming-Cheng Chen"", "",\u00a0Chang Liu"", "",\u00a0Jian Qin"", "",\u00a0Jin-Peng Li"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ming He"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", "",\u00a0Sven H\u00f6fling"", "",\u00a0Chao-Yang Lu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""CAS-Alibaba Quantum Computing Laboratory, CAS Centre for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Shanghai, 201315, China"", ""authors"": [""Hui Wang"", "",\u00a0Yu He"", "",\u00a0Yu-Huai Li"", "",\u00a0Zu-En Su"", "",\u00a0Bo Li"", "",\u00a0He-Liang Huang"", "",\u00a0Xing Ding"", "",\u00a0Ming-Cheng Chen"", "",\u00a0Chang Liu"", "",\u00a0Jian Qin"", "",\u00a0Jin-Peng Li"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ming He"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", "",\u00a0Chao-Yang Lu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""Technische Physik, Physikalisches Instit\u00e4t and Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen-Center for Complex Material Systems, Universitat W\u00fcrzburg, Am Hubland, W\u00fcrzburg, D-97074, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Yu-Ming He"", "",\u00a0Christian Schneider"", "",\u00a0Martin Kamp"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sven H\u00f6fling""]}, {""address"": ""SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, KY16 9SS, UK"", ""authors"": [""Sven H\u00f6fling""]}]",False,"[""Hui Wang"", ""Yu He"", ""Yu-Huai Li"", ""Zu-En Su"", ""Bo Li"", ""He-Liang Huang"", ""Xing Ding"", ""Ming-Cheng Chen"", ""Chang Liu"", ""Jian Qin"", ""Jin-Peng Li"", ""Yu-Ming He"", ""Christian Schneider"", ""Martin Kamp"", ""Cheng-Zhi Peng"", ""Sven H\u00f6fling"", ""Chao-Yang Lu"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Wang, H., He, Y., Li, Y. et al.

article,Broadband image sensor array based on graphene–CMOS integration,"<p>Integrated circuits based on complementary metal-oxide&#8211;semiconductors (CMOS) are at the heart of the technological revolution of the past 40 years, enabling compact and low-cost microelectronic circuits and imaging systems. However, the diversification of this platform into applications other than microcircuits and visible-light cameras has been impeded by the difficulty to combine semiconductors other than silicon with CMOS. Here, we report the monolithic integration of a CMOS integrated circuit with graphene, operating as a high-mobility phototransistor. We demonstrate a high-resolution, broadband image sensor and operate it as a digital camera that is sensitive to ultraviolet, visible and infrared light (300&#8211;2,000&#8197;nm). The demonstrated graphene&#8211;CMOS integration is pivotal for incorporating 2D materials into the next-generation microelectronics, sensor arrays, low-power integrated photonics and CMOS imaging systems covering visible, infrared and terahertz frequencies.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Castelldefels (Barcelona), 08860, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Stijn Goossens"", "",\u00a0Gabriele Navickaite"", "",\u00a0Carles Monasterio"", "",\u00a0Shuchi Gupta"", "",\u00a0Juan Jos\u00e9 Piqueras"", "",\u00a0Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez"", "",\u00a0Gregory Burwell"", "",\u00a0Ivan Nikitskiy"", "",\u00a0Tania Lasanta"", "",\u00a0Teresa Gal\u00e1n"", "",\u00a0Eric Puma"", "",\u00a0Gerasimos Konstantatos"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Frank Koppens""]}, {""address"": ""Graphenea SA, 20018, Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Alba Centeno"", "",\u00a0Amaia Pesquera"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Amaia Zurutuza""]}, {""address"": ""ICREA \u2013 Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recer\u00e7a i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats, Lluis Companys 23, Barcelona, 08010, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Gerasimos Konstantatos"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Frank Koppens""]}]",False,"[""Stijn Goossens"", ""Gabriele Navickaite"", ""Carles Monasterio"", ""Shuchi Gupta"", ""Juan Jos\u00e9 Piqueras"", ""Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez"", ""Gregory Burwell"", ""Ivan Nikitskiy"", ""Tania Lasanta"", ""Teresa Gal\u00e1n"", ""Eric Puma"", ""Alba Centeno"", ""Amaia Pesquera"", ""Amaia Zurutuza"", ""Gerasimos Konstantatos"", ""Frank Koppens""]","Goossens, S., Navickaite, G., Monasterio, C. et al.

article,Dye-sensitized solar cells for efficient power generation under ambient lighting,"<p>Solar cells that operate efficiently under indoor lighting are of great practical interest as they can serve as electric power sources for portable electronics and devices for wireless sensor networks or the Internet of Things. Here, we demonstrate a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) that achieves very high power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) under ambient light conditions. Our photosystem combines two judiciously designed sensitizers, coded D35 and XY1, with the copper complex Cu(II/I)(tmby) as a redox shuttle (tmby, 4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;-tetramethyl-2,2&#8242;-bipyridine), and features a high open-circuit photovoltage of 1.1&#8197;V. The DSC achieves an external quantum efficiency for photocurrent generation that exceeds 90% across the whole visible domain from 400 to 650&#8197;nm, and achieves power outputs of 15.6 and 88.5&#8197;&#956;W cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup> at 200 and 1,000&#8197;lux, respectively, under illumination from a model Osram 930 warm-white fluorescent light tube.

article,Enlargement of optical Schrödinger's cat states,"<p>Superpositions of macroscopically distinct quantum states, introduced in Schr&#246;dinger's famous Gedankenexperiment, are an epitome of quantum &#8216;strangeness&#8217; and a natural tool for determining the validity limits of quantum physics. The optical incarnation of Schr&#246;dinger's cat (SC)&#8212;the superposition of two opposite-amplitude coherent states&#8212;is also the backbone of continuous-variable quantum information processing. However, the existing preparation methods limit the amplitudes of the component coherent states, which curtails the state's usefulness for fundamental and practical applications. Here, we convert a pair of negative squeezed SC states of amplitude 1.15 to a single positive SC state of amplitude 1.85 with a success probability of &#8764;0.2. The protocol consists in bringing the initial states into interference on a beamsplitter and a subsequent heralding quadrature measurement in one of the output channels. Our technique can be realized iteratively, so arbitrarily high amplitudes can, in principle, be reached.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""International Center for Quantum Optics and Quantum Technologies (Russian Quantum Center), Skolkovo, 143025, Moscow, Russia"", ""authors"": [""Demid V.

article,Vectorial optical field reconstruction by attosecond spatial interferometry,"<p>An electrical pulse E(t) is defined completely by its time-dependent amplitude and polarization direction. For optical pulses the manipulation and characterization of the light polarization state is fundamental because of its relevance in several scientific and technological fields. In this work, we demonstrate the complete temporal reconstruction of the electric field of few-cycle pulses with a complex time-dependent polarization. Our experimental approach is based on extreme ultraviolet interferometry with isolated attosecond pulses and on the demonstration that the motion of an attosecond electron wave packet is sensitive to perturbing fields only along the direction of its motion. By exploiting the sensitivity of interferometric techniques and by controlling the emission and acceleration direction of the wave packet, pulses with energies as low as a few hundreds of nanojoules can be reconstructed. Our approach reveals the possibility to characterize completely the electric field of the pulses typically used in visible pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, Politecnico Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milano, 20133, Italy"", ""authors"": [""P.

article,Femtosecond optical polarization switching using a cadmium oxide-based perfect absorber,"<p>Ultrafast control of the polarization state of light may enable a plethora of applications in optics, chemistry and biology. However, conventional polarizing elements, such as polarizers and waveplates, are either static or possess only gigahertz switching speeds. Here, with the aid of high-mobility indium-doped cadmium oxide (CdO) as the gateway plasmonic material, we realize a high-quality factor Berreman-type perfect absorber at a wavelength of 2.08&#8197;&#956;m. On sub-bandgap optical pumping, the perfect absorption resonance strongly redshifts because of the transient increase of the ensemble-averaged effective electron mass of CdO, which leads to an absolute change in the p-polarized reflectance from 1.0 to 86.3%. By combining the exceedingly high modulation depth with the polarization selectivity of the perfect absorber, we experimentally demonstrate a reflective polarizer with a polarization extinction ratio of 91 that can be switched on and off within 800&#8197;fs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, 87185, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yuanmu Yang"", "",\u00a0Salvatore Campione"", "",\u00a0Ting S.
