article,High-temporal-resolution electron microscopy for imaging ultrafast electron dynamics,"<p>Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) has been demonstrated as an effective table-top technique for imaging the temporally evolving dynamics of matter with a subparticle spatial resolution on the timescale of atomic motion. However, imaging the faster motion of electron dynamics in real time has remained beyond reach. Here we demonstrate more than an order of magnitude (16 times) enhancement in the typical temporal resolution of UEM by generating isolated &#8764;30&#8197;fs electron pulses, accelerated at 200&#8197;keV, via the optical-gating approach, with sufficient intensity to probe efficiently the electronic dynamics of matter. Moreover, we investigate the feasibility of attosecond optical gating to generate isolated subfemtosecond electron pulses and attain the desired temporal resolution in electron microscopy to establish &#8216;attomicroscopy&#8217; to allow the imaging of electron motion in the act.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology, Arthur Amos Noyes Laboratory of Chemical Physics, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, 91125, California, USA"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Valley-polarized exciton–polaritons in a monolayer semiconductor,"<p>Single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides are two-dimensional (2D) direct-bandgap semiconductors with degenerate, but inequivalent, &#8216;valleys&#8217; in the electronic structure that can be selectively excited by polarized light. Coherent superpositions of light and matter, exciton&#8211;polaritons, have been observed when these materials are strongly coupled to photons, but these hybrid quasiparticles do not harness the valley sensitivity of the monolayer semiconductors. Here, we observe valley-polarized exciton&#8211;polaritons in monolayers of MoS<sub>2</sub> embedded in a dielectric microcavity. These light&#8211;matter quasiparticles emit polarized light with spectral Rabi splitting and anticrossing indicative of strongly coupled exciton&#8211;polaritons in the topologically separate spin-coupled valleys. The interplay of intervalley depolarization and cavity-modified exciton dynamics in the high-cooperativity regime causes valley-polarized exciton&#8211;polaritons to persist at room temperature, distinct from the vanishing polarization in bare monolayers. Achieving polarization-sensitive polaritonic devices operating at room temperature presents a pathway for manipulating novel valley degrees of freedom in coherent states of light and matter.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, 60208, Illinois, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yen-Jung Chen"", "",\u00a0Teodor K.

article,High-performance direct conversion X-ray detectors based on sintered hybrid lead triiodide perovskite wafers,"<p>Lead halide perovskite semiconductors are in general known to have an inherently high X-ray absorption cross-section and a significantly higher carrier mobility than any other low-temperature solution-processed semiconductor. So far, the processing of several-hundred-micrometres-thick high-quality crystalline perovskite films over a large area has been unresolved for efficient X-ray detection. In this Article, we present a mechanical sintering process to fabricate polycrystalline methyl ammonium lead triiodide perovskite (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) wafers with millimetre thickness and well-defined crystallinity.

article,Deep learning with coherent nanophotonic circuits,"<p>Artificial neural networks are computational network models inspired by signal processing in the brain. These models have dramatically improved performance for many machine-learning tasks, including speech and image recognition. However, today's computing hardware is inefficient at implementing neural networks, in large part because much of it was designed for von Neumann computing schemes. Significant effort has been made towards developing electronic architectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that exhibit improved computational speed and accuracy. Here, we propose a new architecture for a fully optical neural network that, in principle, could offer an enhancement in computational speed and power efficiency over state-of-the-art electronics for conventional inference tasks. We experimentally demonstrate the essential part of the concept using a programmable nanophotonic processor featuring a cascaded array of 56 programmable Mach&#8211;Zehnder interferometers in a silicon photonic integrated circuit and show its utility for vowel recognition.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yichen Shen"", "",\u00a0Nicholas C.

article,Quantum transport simulations in a programmable nanophotonic processor,"<p>Environmental noise and disorder play critical roles in quantum particle and wave transport in complex media, including solid-state and biological systems. While separately both effects are known to reduce transport, recent work predicts that in a limited region of parameter space, noise-induced dephasing can counteract localization effects, leading to enhanced quantum transport. Photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal of developing large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map the role of disorder in quantum transport using a nanophotonic processor: a mesh of 88 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond timescales. Over 64,400 experiments we observe distinct transport regimes, including environment-assisted quantum transport and the &#8216;quantum Goldilocks&#8217; regime in statically disordered discrete-time systems. Low-loss and high-fidelity programmable transformations make this nanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation experiments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, 02139, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nicholas C.
