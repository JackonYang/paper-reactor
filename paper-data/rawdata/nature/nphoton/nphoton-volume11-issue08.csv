article,Satellite-to-ground quantum-limited communication using a 50-kg-class microsatellite,"<p>The recent rapid growth of satellite-constellation programmes for remote sensing and communications, enabled by the availability of small-sized and low-cost satellites, has provided impetus for the development of high-capacity laser communication (lasercom) in space. Quantum-limited communication can enhance the performance of lasercom and is also a prerequisite for the intrinsically hack-proof secure communication known as quantum key distribution. Here, we report a quantum-limited communication experiment between a microsatellite (48&#8197;kg, 50&#8197;cm cube) in low Earth orbit and a ground station. Non-orthogonal polarization states were transmitted from the satellite at a 10&#8197;MHz repetition rate. On the ground, by post-processing the received quantum states with &#8764;0.146 photons per pulse, clock data recovery and polarization reference-frame synchronization were successfully achieved, even under remarkable Doppler shifts. The quantum states were discriminated by a receiver with four photon counters, with a quantum bit error rate below 5%, validating the applicability of our technology to satellite-to-ground lasercom and quantum key distribution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), 4-2-1 Nukui-kitamachi, Koganei, 184-8795, Tokyo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Hideki Takenaka"", "",\u00a0Alberto Carrasco-Casado"", "",\u00a0Mikio Fujiwara"", "",\u00a0Mitsuo Kitamura"", "",\u00a0Masahide Sasaki"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Morio Toyoshima""]}]",False,"[""Hideki Takenaka"", ""Alberto Carrasco-Casado"", ""Mikio Fujiwara"", ""Mitsuo Kitamura"", ""Masahide Sasaki"", ""Morio Toyoshima""]","Takenaka, H., Carrasco-Casado, A., Fujiwara, M. et al.

article,Long-distance free-space quantum key distribution in daylight towards inter-satellite communication,"<p>In the past, long-distance free-space quantum communication experiments could only be implemented at night. During the daytime, the bright background sunlight prohibits quantum communication in transmission under conditions of high channel loss over long distances. Here, by choosing a working wavelength of 1,550&#8197;nm and developing free-space single-mode fibre-coupling technology and ultralow-noise upconversion single-photon detectors, we have overcome the noise due to sunlight and demonstrate free-space quantum key distribution over 53&#8197;km during the day. The total channel loss is &#8764;48&#8197;dB, which is greater than the 40&#8197;dB channel loss between the satellite and ground and between low-Earth-orbit satellites. Our system thus demonstrates the feasibility of satellite-based quantum communication in daylight. Moreover, given that our working wavelength is located in the optical telecom band, our system is naturally compatible with ground fibre networks and thus represents an essential step towards a satellite-constellation-based global quantum network.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, Shanghai Branch, University of Science and Technology of China, Shanghai, 201315, China"", ""authors"": [""Sheng-Kai Liao"", "",\u00a0Hai-Lin Yong"", "",\u00a0Chang Liu"", "",\u00a0Guo-Liang Shentu"", "",\u00a0Dong-Dong Li"", "",\u00a0Jin Lin"", "",\u00a0Hui Dai"", "",\u00a0Bo Li"", "",\u00a0Jian-Yu Guan"", "",\u00a0Wei Chen"", "",\u00a0Yun-Hong Gong"", "",\u00a0Yang Li"", "",\u00a0Ge-Sheng Pan"", "",\u00a0Wen-Zhuo Zhang"", "",\u00a0Juan Yin"", "",\u00a0Ji-Gang Ren"", "",\u00a0Qiang Zhang"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Shanghai, 201315, China"", ""authors"": [""Sheng-Kai Liao"", "",\u00a0Hai-Lin Yong"", "",\u00a0Chang Liu"", "",\u00a0Guo-Liang Shentu"", "",\u00a0Dong-Dong Li"", "",\u00a0Jin Lin"", "",\u00a0Hui Dai"", "",\u00a0Bo Li"", "",\u00a0Jian-Yu Guan"", "",\u00a0Wei Chen"", "",\u00a0Yun-Hong Gong"", "",\u00a0Yang Li"", "",\u00a0Ge-Sheng Pan"", "",\u00a0Wen-Zhuo Zhang"", "",\u00a0Juan Yin"", "",\u00a0Ji-Gang Ren"", "",\u00a0Xiang-Bin Wang"", "",\u00a0Qiang Zhang"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""School of Information Science and Engineering, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China"", ""authors"": [""Shuang-Qiang Zhao"", "",\u00a0Ze-Hong Lin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wei-Yue Liu""]}, {""address"": ""Edward L.

article,High-order multiphoton Thomson scattering,"<p>Electron&#8211;photon scattering, or Thomson scattering, is one of the most fundamental mechanisms in electrodynamics, underlying laboratory and astrophysical sources of high-energy X-rays. After a century of studies, it is only recently that sufficiently high electromagnetic field strengths have been available to experimentally study the nonlinear regime of Thomson scattering in the laboratory. Making use of a high-power laser and a laser-driven electron accelerator, we made the first measurements of high-order multiphoton scattering, in which more than 500 near-infrared laser photons were scattered by a single electron into a single X-ray photon. Both the electron motion and the scattered photons were found to depend nonlinearly on field strength. The observed angular distribution of scattered X-rays permits independent measurement of absolute intensity, in situ, during interactions of ultra-intense laser light with free electrons. Furthermore, the experiment's potential to generate attosecond-duration hard X-ray pulses can enable the study of ultrafast nuclear dynamics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, 68588, Nebraska, USA"", ""authors"": [""Wenchao Yan"", "",\u00a0Colton Fruhling"", "",\u00a0Grigory Golovin"", "",\u00a0Daniel Haden"", "",\u00a0Ping Zhang"", "",\u00a0Baozhen Zhao"", "",\u00a0Jun Zhang"", "",\u00a0Cheng Liu"", "",\u00a0Shouyuan Chen"", "",\u00a0Sudeep Banerjee"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Donald Umstadter""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory for Laser Plasmas (Ministry of Education) and School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China"", ""authors"": [""Ji Luo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Min Chen""]}, {""address"": ""Collaborative Innovation Center of IFSA (CICIFSA), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China"", ""authors"": [""Ji Luo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Min Chen""]}]",False,"[""Wenchao Yan"", ""Colton Fruhling"", ""Grigory Golovin"", ""Daniel Haden"", ""Ji Luo"", ""Ping Zhang"", ""Baozhen Zhao"", ""Jun Zhang"", ""Cheng Liu"", ""Min Chen"", ""Shouyuan Chen"", ""Sudeep Banerjee"", ""Donald Umstadter""]","Yan, W., Fruhling, C., Golovin, G. et al.

article,Phonon scattering inhibits simultaneous near-unity efficiency and indistinguishability in semiconductor single-photon sources,"<p>Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a leading platform to generate highly indistinguishable photons efficiently, and this work addresses the timely question of how good these solid-state sources can ultimately be. We establish the crucial role of lattice relaxation in these systems in giving rise to trade-offs between indistinguishability and efficiency. We analyse the two source architectures most commonly employed: a QD embedded in a waveguide and a QD coupled to an optical cavity. For waveguides, we demonstrate that the broadband Purcell effect results in a simple inverse relationship, in which indistinguishability and efficiency cannot be simultaneously increased. For cavities, the frequency selectivity of the Purcell enhancement results in a more subtle trade-off, in which indistinguishability and efficiency can be increased simultaneously, although not arbitrarily, which limits a source with near-unity indistinguishability (&gt;99%) to an efficiency of approximately 96% for realistic parameters.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Photonics Engineering, DTU Fotonik, \u00d8rsteds Plads, Kongens Lyngby, 2800, Denmark"", ""authors"": [""Jake Iles-Smith"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jesper M\u00f8rk""]}, {""address"": ""H.
