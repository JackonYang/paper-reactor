article,Nonlinear signal multiplexing for communication beyond the Kerr nonlinearity limit,"<p>Current optical fibre transmission systems rely on modulation, coding and multiplexing techniques that were originally developed for linear communication channels. However, linear transmission techniques are not fully compatible with a transmission medium with a nonlinear response, which is the case for an optical fibre. As a consequence, the Kerr nonlinearity in fibre imposes a limit on the performance and the achievable transmission rate of the conventional optical fibre communication systems. Here we show that a transmission performance beyond the conventional Kerr nonlinearity limit can be achieved by encoding all the available degrees of freedom and nonlinearly multiplexing signals in the so-called nonlinear Fourier spectrum, which evolves linearly along the fibre link. This result strongly motivates a fundamental paradigm shift in modulation, coding and signal-processing techniques for optical fibre transmission technology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nokia Bell Labs, Lorenzstra\u00dfe 10, Stuttgart, 70435, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Son Thai Le"", "",\u00a0Vahid Aref"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Henning Buelow""]}]",False,"[""Son Thai Le"", ""Vahid Aref"", ""Henning Buelow""]","Le, S., Aref, V. & Buelow, H.

article,Tunable room-temperature single-photon emission at telecom wavelengths from sp3 defects in carbon nanotubes,"<p>Generating quantum light emitters that operate at room temperature and at telecom wavelengths remains a significant materials challenge. To achieve this goal requires light sources that emit in the near-infrared wavelength region and that, ideally, are tunable to allow desired output wavelengths to be accessed in a controllable manner. Here, we show that exciton localization at covalently introduced aryl sp<sup>3</sup> defect sites in single-walled carbon nanotubes provides a route to room-temperature single-photon emission with ultrahigh single-photon purity (99%) and enhanced emission stability approaching the shot-noise limit. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inherent optical tunability of single-walled carbon nanotubes, present in their structural diversity, allows us to generate room-temperature single-photon emission spanning the entire telecom band. Single-photon emission deep into the centre of the telecom C band (1.55&#8197;&#181;m) is achieved at the largest nanotube diameters we explore (0.936&#8197;nm).</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Materials Physics and Applications Division, Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, 87545, New Mexico, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiaowei He"", "",\u00a0Nicolai F.

article,Depolarization signatures map gold nanorods within biological tissue,"<p>Owing to their electromagnetic properties, tunability and biocompatibility, gold nanorods are being investigated as multifunctional probes for a range of biomedical applications. However, detection beyond the reach of traditional fluorescence and two-photon approaches and quantitation of their concentration in biological tissue remain challenging tasks in microscopy. Here, we show how the size and aspect ratio that impart gold nanorods with their plasmonic properties also make them a source of entropy. We report on how depolarization can be exploited as a strategy to visualize gold nanorod diffusion and distribution in biologically relevant scenarios ex vivo, in vitro and in vivo. We identify a deterministic relation between depolarization and nanoparticle concentration. As a result, some of the most stringent experimental conditions can be relaxed, and susceptibility to artefacts is reduced, enabling microscopic and macroscopic applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02115, Massachusetts, USA"", ""authors"": [""Norman Lippok"", "",\u00a0Martin Villiger"", "",\u00a0Eelco F.

article,Integrating solids and gases for attosecond pulse generation,"<p>Control of the field of few-cycle optical pulses has had an enormous impact on attosecond science. Subcycle pulses open the potential for non-adiabatic phase matching while concentrating the electric field so it can be used most efficiently. However, subcycle field transients have been difficult to generate. We exploit the perturbative response of a sub-100&#8197;&#181;m thick monocrystalline quartz plate irradiated by an intense few-cycle 1.8&#8197;&#181;m pulse, which creates a phase-controlled supercontinuum spectrum. Within the quartz, the pulse becomes space&#8211;time coupled as it generates a parallel second harmonic. Vacuum propagation naturally leads to a subcycle electric-field transient whose envelope is sculpted by the carrier envelope phase of the incident radiation. We show that a second medium (either gas or solid) can generate isolated attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet region. With no optical elements between the components, the process is scalable to very high energy pulses and allows the use of diverse media.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, K1N 6N5, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""T.

article,Temporal solitons in microresonators driven by optical pulses,"<p>Continuous-wave laser-driven, high-Q Kerr&#8211;nonlinear optical microresonators have enabled the generation of optical frequency combs, ultralow-noise microwaves and ultrashort optical pulses at tens of gigahertz repetition rate. Here, we break with the paradigm of the continuous-wave driving and instead use periodic, picosecond optical pulses. In a fibre-based Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microresonator we observe the deterministic generation of stable femtosecond dissipative cavity solitons &#8216;on top&#8217; of the resonantly enhanced driving pulses. The solitons lock to the driving pulse, which enables direct all-optical control of the soliton's repetition rate and tuning of its carrier-envelope offset frequency. When compared with continuous-wave-driven microresonators or non-resonant pulsed supercontinuum generation, this new approach is more efficient and can yield broadband frequency combs at an average driving power significantly below the continuous-wave parametric threshold. Bridging the fields of continuous-wave-driven resonant and pulse-driven non-resonant nonlinear optics, these results enable efficient microresonator frequency combs, resonant supercontinuum generation and microphotonic pulse compression.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM), Time and Frequency, Rue de l'Observatoire 58, CH-2000 Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Ewelina Obrzud"", "",\u00a0Steve Lecomte"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tobias Herr""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Astronomy, University of Geneva, 51 ch. des Maillettes, CH-1290 Versoix, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Ewelina Obrzud""]}]",False,"[""Ewelina Obrzud"", ""Steve Lecomte"", ""Tobias Herr""]","Obrzud, E., Lecomte, S. & Herr, T.
