letter,Highly efficient on-chip direct electronic–plasmonic transducers,"<p>Photonic elements can carry information with a capacity exceeding 1,000 times that of electronic components, but, due to the optical diffraction limit, these elements are large and difficult to integrate with modern-day nanoelectronics or upcoming packages, such as three-dimensional integrated circuits or stacked high-bandwidth memories. Surface plasmon polaritons can be confined to subwavelength dimensions and can carry information at high speeds (&gt;100&#8201;THz). To combine the small dimensions of nanoelectronics with the fast operating speed of optics via plasmonics, on-chip electronic&#8211;plasmonic transducers that directly convert electrical signals into plasmonic signals (and vice versa) are required. Here, we report electronic&#8211;plasmonic transducers based on metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal tunnel junctions coupled to plasmonic waveguides with high-efficiency on-chip generation, manipulation and readout of plasmons. These junctions can be readily integrated into existing technologies, and we thus believe that they are promising for applications in on-chip integrated plasmonic circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, 3 Science Drive 3, 117543, Singapore, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Wei Du"", "",\u00a0Tao Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christian A.

letter,Ultrafast synthesis and switching of light polarization in nonlinear anisotropic metamaterials,"<p>Optical communications, laser science, microscopy and metrology demand control of light polarization, which is also used as a probe of chemical and biological systems. Typically, certain polarization states of light are achieved using macroscopic anisotropic crystals. Metamaterials and metasurfaces have recently been developed to act as efficient passive polarization components of subwavelength dimensions. However, active polarization control has so far been mainly limited to microwave and terahertz wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate all-optical switching of visible light polarization, achieving up to 60&#176; rotation of the polarization ellipse at picosecond timescales. This is accomplished both under control illumination and in a self-phase modulation regime, where the intensity of light affects its own polarization state, by exploiting the strong anisotropy and nonlinear response of a hyperbolic metamaterial. The effects are general for any resonant, anisotropic, nonlinear nanoantennas and metasurfaces and are suited to numerous photonic applications and material characterization techniques where ultrafast polarization shaping is required.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, King\u2019s College London, Strand, London, WC2R 2LS, UK"", ""authors"": [""Luke H.

letter,"Laser refrigeration, alignment and rotation of levitated Yb3+:YLF nanocrystals","<p>The ability to cool and manipulate levitated nanoparticles in vacuum is a promising tool for exploring macroscopic quantum mechanics, precision measurements of forces and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The extreme isolation afforded by optical levitation offers a low-noise, undamped environment that has been used to measure zeptonewton forces and radiation pressure shot noise, and to demonstrate centre-of-mass motion cooling. Ground-state cooling and the creation of macroscopic quantum superpositions are now within reach, but control of both the centre of mass and internal temperature is required. While cooling the centre-of-mass motion to micro-kelvin temperatures has now been achieved, the internal temperature has remained at or above room temperature.

letter,In-chip microstructures and photonic devices fabricated by nonlinear laser lithography deep inside silicon,"<p>Silicon is an excellent material for microelectronics and integrated photonics, with untapped potential for mid-infrared optics. Despite broad recognition of the importance of the third dimension, current lithography methods do not allow the fabrication of photonic devices and functional microelements directly inside silicon chips. Even relatively simple curved geometries cannot be realized with techniques like reactive ion etching. Embedded optical elements, electronic devices and better electronic&#8211;photonic integration are lacking. Here, we demonstrate laser-based fabrication of complex 3D structures deep inside silicon using 1-&#181;m-sized dots and rod-like structures of adjustable length as basic building blocks. The laser-modified Si has an optical index different to that in unmodified parts, enabling the creation of numerous photonic devices. Optionally, these parts can be chemically etched to produce desired 3D shapes.

article,Lasing in topological edge states of a one-dimensional lattice,"<p>Topology describes properties that remain unaffected by smooth distortions. Its main hallmark is the emergence of edge states localized at the boundary between regions characterized by distinct topological invariants. Because their properties are inherited from the topology of the bulk, these edge states present a strong immunity to distortions of the underlying architecture. This feature offers new opportunities for robust trapping of light in nano- and micrometre-scale systems subject to fabrication imperfections and environmentally induced deformations. Here, we report lasing in such topological edge states of a one-dimensional lattice of polariton micropillars that implements an orbital version of the Su&#8211;Schrieffer&#8211;Heeger Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that lasing in these states persists under local deformations of the lattice. These results open the way to the implementation of chiral lasers in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and, when combined with polariton interactions, to the study of nonlinear phenomena in topological photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, C2N - Marcoussis, 91460, Marcoussis, France"", ""authors"": [""P.

article,Giant light-harvesting nanoantenna for single-molecule detection in ambient light,"<p>Here, we explore the enhancement of single-molecule emission by a polymeric nanoantenna that can harvest energy from thousands of donor dyes to a single acceptor. In this nanoantenna, the cationic dyes are brought together, in very close proximity, using bulky counterions, thus enabling ultrafast diffusion of excitation energy (&#8804;30&#8201;fs) with minimal losses. Our 60&#8201;nm nanoparticles containing &gt;10,000 rhodamine-based donor dyes can efficiently transfer energy to 1&#8211;2 acceptors, resulting in an antenna effect of ~1,000. Therefore, single Cy5-based acceptors become 25-fold brighter than quantum dots QD655. This unprecedented amplification of the acceptor dye emission enables observation of single molecules at illumination powers (1&#8211;10&#8201;mW&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>) that are &gt;10,000-fold lower than typically required in single-molecule measurements.

article,Control of light by curved space in nanophotonic structures,"<p>Nanophotonics is based on the ability to construct structures with specific spatial distributions of the refractive index. Conventional nanophotonic structures are fabricated in planar settings, similar to electronic integrated circuits. We present a new class of nanophotonic structures with intricate design in three dimensions inspired by general relativity concepts, where the evolution of light is controlled through the space curvature of the medium. We demonstrate this concept by studying the evolution of light in a paraboloid structure inspired by the Schwarzschild metric describing the space surrounding a massive black hole. Our construction allows control over the trajectories, the diffraction properties and the phase and group velocities of wavepackets propagating within the curved-space structure. Finally, our structure exhibits tunnelling through an electromagnetic bottleneck by transforming guided modes into radiation modes and back. This generic concept can serve as the basis for curved nanophotonics and can be employed in integrated photonic circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physics Department and Solid State Institute, Technion, 32000, Haifa, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Rivka Bekenstein"", "",\u00a0Yonatan Sharabi"", "",\u00a0Or Tal"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mordechai Segev""]}, {""address"": ""Physics Department, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA"", ""authors"": [""Rivka Bekenstein""]}, {""address"": ""ITAMP, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA"", ""authors"": [""Rivka Bekenstein""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics and the Brojde Center for Innovative Engineering and Computer Science, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 91904, Jerusalem, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Yossef Kabessa"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Aharon J.

article,Soliton crystals in Kerr resonators,"<p>Self-organized solitons confined to an optical resonator would offer unique capabilities for experiments in communication, computation and sensing with light. Here, we report the observation of soliton crystals in monolithic Kerr microresonators&#8212;spontaneously and collectively ordered ensembles of co-propagating solitons whose interactions discretize their allowed temporal separations. We unambiguously identify and characterize soliton crystals through analysis of their &#8216;fingerprint&#8217; optical spectra, which arise from spectral interference between the solitons. We identify a rich space of soliton crystals exhibiting crystallographic defects and we perform time-domain measurements to directly confirm our inference of their crystal structure. Soliton crystallization is explained by long-range soliton interactions mediated by resonator mode degeneracies, and we probe the qualitative difference between soliton crystals and the disorganized soliton liquid that would form in the absence of these interactions. Our work explores the physics of monolithic Kerr resonators in a regime of dense soliton occupation and offers a way to increase the efficiency of Kerr combs. Furthermore, the extreme degeneracy of the configuration space of soliton crystals suggests an implementation for an on-chip optical buffer.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder, CO, 80305, USA"", ""authors"": [""Daniel C.
