letter,Experimental nested purification for a linear optical quantum repeater,"<p>Quantum repeaters are essential elements for demonstrating global-scale quantum communication. Over the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to implementing a practical quantum repeater. However, nested purification, the backbone of a quantum repeater, remains a challenge because the capacity for successive entanglement manipulation is still absent. Here, we propose and demonstrate an architecture of nested purification using spontaneous parametric downconversion sources. A heralded entangled photon pair with higher fidelity is successfully purified from two copies of low-fidelity pairs that experience entanglement swapping and noisy channels. By delicately designing the optical circuits, double-pair emission noise is eliminated automatically and the purified state can be used for scalable entanglement connections to extend the communication distance. Combined with a quantum memory, our approach can be applied immediately in the implemention of a practical quantum repeater.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Shanghai Branch, National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, 201315, Shanghai, China"", ""authors"": [""Luo-Kan Chen"", "",\u00a0Hai-Lin Yong"", "",\u00a0Ping Xu"", "",\u00a0Xing-Can Yao"", "",\u00a0Zheng-Da Li"", "",\u00a0Chang Liu"", "",\u00a0He Lu"", "",\u00a0Nai-Le Liu"", "",\u00a0Li Li"", "",\u00a0Tao Yang"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", "",\u00a0Bo Zhao"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ao Chen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""CAS Center for Excellence and Synergetic Innovation Center in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, 201315, Shanghai, China"", ""authors"": [""Luo-Kan Chen"", "",\u00a0Hai-Lin Yong"", "",\u00a0Ping Xu"", "",\u00a0Xing-Can Yao"", "",\u00a0Zheng-Da Li"", "",\u00a0Chang Liu"", "",\u00a0He Lu"", "",\u00a0Nai-Le Liu"", "",\u00a0Li Li"", "",\u00a0Tao Yang"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", "",\u00a0Bo Zhao"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ao Chen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""CAS-Alibaba Quantum Computing Laboratory, 201315, Shanghai, China"", ""authors"": [""Luo-Kan Chen"", "",\u00a0Hai-Lin Yong"", "",\u00a0Ping Xu"", "",\u00a0Xing-Can Yao"", "",\u00a0Zheng-Da Li"", "",\u00a0Chang Liu"", "",\u00a0He Lu"", "",\u00a0Nai-Le Liu"", "",\u00a0Li Li"", "",\u00a0Tao Yang"", "",\u00a0Cheng-Zhi Peng"", "",\u00a0Bo Zhao"", "",\u00a0Yu-Ao Chen"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240, Shanghai, China"", ""authors"": [""Tong Xiang""]}]",False,"[""Luo-Kan Chen"", ""Hai-Lin Yong"", ""Ping Xu"", ""Xing-Can Yao"", ""Tong Xiang"", ""Zheng-Da Li"", ""Chang Liu"", ""He Lu"", ""Nai-Le Liu"", ""Li Li"", ""Tao Yang"", ""Cheng-Zhi Peng"", ""Bo Zhao"", ""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Chen, L., Yong, H., Xu, P. et al.

letter,Unconditional violation of the shot-noise limit in photonic quantum metrology,"<p>Interferometric phase measurement is widely used to precisely determine quantities such as length, speed and material properties. Without quantum correlations, the best phase sensitivity \({\boldsymbol{\Delta }}{\boldsymbol{\phi }}\) achievable using n photons is the shot-noise limit, \({\boldsymbol{\Delta }}{\boldsymbol{\phi }}=1\,/\sqrt{{n}}\). Quantum-enhanced metrology promises better sensitivity, but, despite theoretical proposals stretching back decades, no measurement using photonic (that is, definite photon number) quantum states has truly surpassed the shot-noise limit. Instead, all such demonstrations, by discounting photon loss, detector inefficiency or other imperfections, have considered only a subset of the photons used. Here, we use an ultrahigh-efficiency photon source and detectors to perform unconditional entanglement-enhanced photonic interferometry. Sampling a birefringent phase shift, we demonstrate precision beyond the shot-noise limit without artificially correcting our results for loss and imperfections. Our results enable quantum-enhanced phase measurements at low photon flux and open the door to the next generation of optical quantum metrology advances.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre for Quantum Dynamics, Griffith University, Brisbane, Queensland, 4111, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Sergei Slussarenko"", "",\u00a0Morgan M.

letter,Long lifetimes and effective isolation of ions in optical and electrostatic traps,"<p>Long trapping times, as well as low heating and decoherence rates, essentially isolating individual particles from the environment, are crucial ingredients for controlling these particles on the quantum level. Here, we demonstrate that optical trapping and isolation of ions can be performed on a level comparable to neutral atoms, boosting their lifetime by three orders of magnitude compared to previous work, and measure an upper bound of the total heating rate. The achieved isolation from the environment opens a path to a novel regime of ultracold interactions of ions and atoms at previously inaccessible collision energies and may permit a novel class of experimental quantum simulations with ions and atoms in a variety of versatile optical trapping geometries, for example, bichromatic traps or higher-dimensional optical lattices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg, Physikalisches Institut, Hermann-Herder-Stra\u00dfe 3, 79104, Freiburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Alexander Lambrecht"", "",\u00a0Julian Schmidt"", "",\u00a0Pascal Weckesser"", "",\u00a0Markus Debatin"", "",\u00a0Leon Karpa"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Tobias Schaetz""]}, {""address"": ""Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS), Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg, 79104, Freiburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Leon Karpa""]}]",False,"[""Alexander Lambrecht"", ""Julian Schmidt"", ""Pascal Weckesser"", ""Markus Debatin"", ""Leon Karpa"", ""Tobias Schaetz""]","Lambrecht, A., Schmidt, J., Weckesser, P. et al.

article,Hard X-ray free-electron laser with femtosecond-scale timing jitter,"<p>The hard X-ray free-electron laser at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL-XFEL) in the Republic of Korea achieved saturation of a 0.144&#8201;nm free-electron laser beam on 27 November 2016, making it the third hard X-ray free-electron laser in the world, following the demonstrations of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact Free Electron Laser (SACLA). The use of electron-beam-based alignment incorporating undulator radiation spectrum analysis has allowed reliable operation of PAL-XFEL with unprecedented temporal stability and dispersion-free orbits. In particular, a timing jitter of just 20&#8201;fs for the free-electron laser photon beam is consistently achieved due to the use of a state-of-the-art design of the electron linear accelerator and electron-beam-based alignment. The low timing jitter of the electron beam makes it possible to observe Bi(111) phonon dynamics without the need for timing-jitter correction, indicating that PAL-XFEL will be an extremely useful tool for hard X-ray time-resolved experiments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, 37673, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Heung-Sik Kang"", "",\u00a0Chang-Ki Min"", "",\u00a0Hoon Heo"", "",\u00a0Changbum Kim"", "",\u00a0Haeryong Yang"", "",\u00a0Gyujin Kim"", "",\u00a0Inhyuk Nam"", "",\u00a0Soung Youl Baek"", "",\u00a0Hyo-Jin Choi"", "",\u00a0Geonyeong Mun"", "",\u00a0Byoung Ryul Park"", "",\u00a0Young Jin Suh"", "",\u00a0Dong Cheol Shin"", "",\u00a0Jinyul Hu"", "",\u00a0Juho Hong"", "",\u00a0Seonghoon Jung"", "",\u00a0Sang-Hee Kim"", "",\u00a0KwangHoon Kim"", "",\u00a0Donghyun Na"", "",\u00a0Soung Soo Park"", "",\u00a0Yong Jung Park"", "",\u00a0Jang-Hui Han"", "",\u00a0Young Gyu Jung"", "",\u00a0Seong Hun Jeong"", "",\u00a0Hong Gi Lee"", "",\u00a0Sangbong Lee"", "",\u00a0Sojeong Lee"", "",\u00a0Woul-Woo Lee"", "",\u00a0Bonggi Oh"", "",\u00a0Hyung Suck Suh"", "",\u00a0Yong Woon Parc"", "",\u00a0Sung-Ju Park"", "",\u00a0Min Ho Kim"", "",\u00a0Nam-Suk Jung"", "",\u00a0Young-Chan Kim"", "",\u00a0Mong-Soo Lee"", "",\u00a0Bong-Ho Lee"", "",\u00a0Chi-Won Sung"", "",\u00a0Ik-Su Mok"", "",\u00a0Jung-Moo Yang"", "",\u00a0Chae-Soon Lee"", "",\u00a0Hocheol Shin"", "",\u00a0Ji Hwa Kim"", "",\u00a0Yongsam Kim"", "",\u00a0Jae Hyuk Lee"", "",\u00a0Sang-Youn Park"", "",\u00a0Jangwoo Kim"", "",\u00a0Jaeku Park"", "",\u00a0Intae Eom"", "",\u00a0Seungyu Rah"", "",\u00a0Sunam Kim"", "",\u00a0Ki Hyun Nam"", "",\u00a0Jaehyun Park"", "",\u00a0Jaehun Park"", "",\u00a0Sangsoo Kim"", "",\u00a0Soonam Kwon"", "",\u00a0Sang Han Park"", "",\u00a0Kyung Sook Kim"", "",\u00a0Hyojung Hyun"", "",\u00a0Seung Nam Kim"", "",\u00a0Seonghan Kim"", "",\u00a0Sun-min Hwang"", "",\u00a0Myong Jin Kim"", "",\u00a0Chae-yong Lim"", "",\u00a0Chung-Jong Yu"", "",\u00a0Bong-Soo Kim"", "",\u00a0Tai-Hee Kang"", "",\u00a0Kwang-Woo Kim"", "",\u00a0Seung-Hwan Kim"", "",\u00a0Hee-Seock Lee"", "",\u00a0Heung-Soo Lee"", "",\u00a0Ki-Hyeon Park"", "",\u00a0Tae-Yeong Koo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dong-Eon Kim""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, POSTECH, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, 37673, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""In Soo Ko""]}]",False,"[""Heung-Sik Kang"", ""Chang-Ki Min"", ""Hoon Heo"", ""Changbum Kim"", ""Haeryong Yang"", ""Gyujin Kim"", ""Inhyuk Nam"", ""Soung Youl Baek"", ""Hyo-Jin Choi"", ""Geonyeong Mun"", ""Byoung Ryul Park"", ""Young Jin Suh"", ""Dong Cheol Shin"", ""Jinyul Hu"", ""Juho Hong"", ""Seonghoon Jung"", ""Sang-Hee Kim"", ""KwangHoon Kim"", ""Donghyun Na"", ""Soung Soo Park"", ""Yong Jung Park"", ""Jang-Hui Han"", ""Young Gyu Jung"", ""Seong Hun Jeong"", ""Hong Gi Lee"", ""Sangbong Lee"", ""Sojeong Lee"", ""Woul-Woo Lee"", ""Bonggi Oh"", ""Hyung Suck Suh"", ""Yong Woon Parc"", ""Sung-Ju Park"", ""Min Ho Kim"", ""Nam-Suk Jung"", ""Young-Chan Kim"", ""Mong-Soo Lee"", ""Bong-Ho Lee"", ""Chi-Won Sung"", ""Ik-Su Mok"", ""Jung-Moo Yang"", ""Chae-Soon Lee"", ""Hocheol Shin"", ""Ji Hwa Kim"", ""Yongsam Kim"", ""Jae Hyuk Lee"", ""Sang-Youn Park"", ""Jangwoo Kim"", ""Jaeku Park"", ""Intae Eom"", ""Seungyu Rah"", ""Sunam Kim"", ""Ki Hyun Nam"", ""Jaehyun Park"", ""Jaehun Park"", ""Sangsoo Kim"", ""Soonam Kwon"", ""Sang Han Park"", ""Kyung Sook Kim"", ""Hyojung Hyun"", ""Seung Nam Kim"", ""Seonghan Kim"", ""Sun-min Hwang"", ""Myong Jin Kim"", ""Chae-yong Lim"", ""Chung-Jong Yu"", ""Bong-Soo Kim"", ""Tai-Hee Kang"", ""Kwang-Woo Kim"", ""Seung-Hwan Kim"", ""Hee-Seock Lee"", ""Heung-Soo Lee"", ""Ki-Hyeon Park"", ""Tae-Yeong Koo"", ""Dong-Eon Kim"", ""In Soo Ko""]","Kang, H., Min, C., Heo, H. et al.

article,Ultrasensitive plano-concave optical microresonators for ultrasound sensing,"<p>Highly sensitive broadband ultrasound detectors are needed to expand the capabilities of biomedical ultrasound, photoacoustic imaging and industrial ultrasonic non-destructive testing techniques. Here, a generic optical ultrasound sensing concept based on a novel plano-concave polymer microresonator is described. This achieves strong optical confinement (Q-factors &gt; 10<sup>5</sup>) resulting in very high sensitivity with excellent broadband acoustic frequency response and wide directivity. The concept is highly scalable in terms of bandwidth and sensitivity. To illustrate this, a family of microresonator sensors with broadband acoustic responses up to 40&#8201;MHz and noise-equivalent pressures as low as 1.6&#8201;mPa per &#8730;Hz have been fabricated and comprehensively characterized in terms of their acoustic performance.

Strong coupling is used in the optical and infrared regimes, for instance, to produce non-classical states of light, enhance optical nonlinearities and control quantum states. Here, we report the first observation of Rabi oscillations of an X-ray photon between two resonant <sup>57</sup>Fe layers embedded in two coupled cavities. The system is described by an effective Hamiltonian, in which the two layers couple strongly. We observe sinusoidal beating as the signature of the Rabi oscillations in the system&#8217;s temporal evolution, as well as the splitting of nuclear resonances in the reflected light spectrum. Our results significantly advance the development of the new field of X-ray quantum optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Notkestrasse 85, 22607, Hamburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Johann Haber"", "",\u00a0Cornelius Strohm"", "",\u00a0Svenja Willing"", "",\u00a0Jakob Gollwitzer"", "",\u00a0Lars Bocklage"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ralf R\u00f6hlsberger""]}, {""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kernphysik, Saupfercheckweg 1, 69117, Heidelberg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Xiangjin Kong"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Adriana P\u00e1lffy""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, National University of Defence Technology, Changsha, 410073, People\u2019s Republic of China"", ""authors"": [""Xiangjin Kong""]}, {""address"": ""European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, CS 40220, 38043, Grenoble Cedex, France"", ""authors"": [""Rudolf R\u00fcffer""]}]",False,"[""Johann Haber"", ""Xiangjin Kong"", ""Cornelius Strohm"", ""Svenja Willing"", ""Jakob Gollwitzer"", ""Lars Bocklage"", ""Rudolf R\u00fcffer"", ""Adriana P\u00e1lffy"", ""Ralf R\u00f6hlsberger""]","Haber, J., Kong, X., Strohm, C. et al.

article,Cs2AgBiBr6 single-crystal X-ray detectors with a low detection limit,"<p>Sensitive X-ray detection is crucial for medical diagnosis, industrial inspection and scientific research. The recently described hybrid lead halide perovskites have demonstrated low-cost fabrication and outstanding performance for direct X-ray detection, but they all contain toxic Pb in a soluble form. Here, we report sensitive X-ray detectors using solution-processed double perovskite Cs<sub>2</sub>AgBiBr<sub>6</sub> single crystals. Through thermal annealing and surface treatment, we largely eliminate Ag<sup>+</sup>/Bi<sup>3+</sup> disordering and improve the crystal resistivity, resulting in a detector with a minimum detectable dose rate as low as 59.7&#8201;nGy<sub>air</sub>&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, comparable to the latest record of 0.036&#8201;&#956;Gy<sub>air</sub>&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> using CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystals. Suppressed ion migration in Cs<sub>2</sub>AgBiBr<sub>6</sub> permits relatively large external bias, guaranteeing efficient charge collection without a substantial increase in noise current and thus&#160;enabling the low detection limit.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), 430074, Wuhan, China"", ""authors"": [""Weicheng Pan"", "",\u00a0Haodi Wu"", "",\u00a0Jiajun Luo"", "",\u00a0Cong Ge"", "",\u00a0Chao Chen"", "",\u00a0Guangda Niu"", "",\u00a0Lixiao Yin"", "",\u00a0Ying Zhou"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jiang Tang""]}, {""address"": ""School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), 430074, Wuhan, China"", ""authors"": [""Weicheng Pan"", "",\u00a0Haodi Wu"", "",\u00a0Jiajun Luo"", "",\u00a0Cong Ge"", "",\u00a0Chao Chen"", "",\u00a0Guangda Niu"", "",\u00a0Lixiao Yin"", "",\u00a0Ying Zhou"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jiang Tang""]}, {""address"": ""School of Information Engineering, Nanchang University, 330031, Nanchang, China"", ""authors"": [""Zhenzhou Deng""]}, {""address"": ""School of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 430074, Wuhan, China"", ""authors"": [""Zhenzhou Deng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Qingguo Xie""]}, {""address"": ""Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials InnovationS (SIEMIS), College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy & Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University, 215006, Suzhou, China"", ""authors"": [""Xiaowei Jiang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wan-Jian Yin""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Advanced Carbon Materials and Wearable Energy Technologies of Jiangsu Province, Soochow University, 215006, Suzhou, China"", ""authors"": [""Xiaowei Jiang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wan-Jian Yin""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Microstructure and Property of Advanced Materials, Beijing University of Technology, 100124, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Lujun Zhu"", "",\u00a0Xiaoxing Ke"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Manling Sui""]}]",False,"[""Weicheng Pan"", ""Haodi Wu"", ""Jiajun Luo"", ""Zhenzhou Deng"", ""Cong Ge"", ""Chao Chen"", ""Xiaowei Jiang"", ""Wan-Jian Yin"", ""Guangda Niu"", ""Lujun Zhu"", ""Lixiao Yin"", ""Ying Zhou"", ""Qingguo Xie"", ""Xiaoxing Ke"", ""Manling Sui"", ""Jiang Tang""]","Pan, W., Wu, H., Luo, J. et al.

article,Diffraction-free space–time light sheets,"<p>Diffraction-free optical beams propagate freely without change in shape and scale. Monochromatic beams that avoid diffractive spreading require two-dimensional transverse profiles and there are no corresponding solutions for profiles restricted to one transverse dimension. Here, we demonstrate that the temporal degree of freedom can be exploited to efficiently synthesize one-dimensional pulsed light sheets that propagate self-similarly in free space, with no need for nonlinearity or dispersion. By introducing programmable conical (hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptical) spectral correlations between the beam&#8217;s spatiotemporal degrees of freedom, a continuum of families of propagation-invariant light sheets is generated. The spectral loci of such beams are the reduced-dimensionality trajectories at the intersection of the light-cone with spatiotemporal spectral planes. Far from being exceptional, self-similar axial-propagation in free space is a generic feature of fields whose spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are tightly correlated. These &#8216;space&#8211;time&#8217; light sheets can be useful in microscopy, nonlinear spectroscopy, and non-contact measurements.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CREOL, The College of Optics & Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, 32816, USA"", ""authors"": [""H.
