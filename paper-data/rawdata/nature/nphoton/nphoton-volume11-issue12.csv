review article,Non-Hermitian photonics based on parity–time symmetry,"<p>Nearly one century after the birth of quantum mechanics, parity&#8211;time symmetry is revolutionizing and extending quantum theories to include a unique family of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. While conceptually striking, experimental demonstration of parity&#8211;time symmetry remains unexplored in quantum electronic systems. The flexibility of photonics allows for creating and superposing non-Hermitian eigenstates with ease using optical gain and loss, which makes it an ideal platform to explore various non-Hermitian quantum symmetry paradigms for novel device functionalities. Such explorations that employ classical photonic platforms not only deepen our understanding of fundamental quantum physics but also facilitate technological breakthroughs for photonic applications.

review article,Two-dimensional topological photonics,"<p>Originating from the studies of two-dimensional condensed-matter states, the concept of topological order has recently been expanded to other fields of physics and engineering, particularly optics and photonics. Topological photonic structures have already overturned some of the traditional views on wave propagation and manipulation. The application of topological concepts to guided wave propagation has enabled novel photonic devices, such as reflection-free sharply bent waveguides, robust delay lines, spin-polarized switches and non-reciprocal devices. Discrete degrees of freedom, widely used in condensed-matter physics, such as spin and valley, are now entering the realm of photonics.

review article,Non-reciprocal photonics based on time modulation,"<p>Reciprocity is a fundamental principle in optics, requiring that the response of a transmission channel is symmetric when source and observation points are interchanged. It is of major significance because it poses fundamental constraints on the way we process optical signals. Non-reciprocal devices, which break this symmetry, have become fundamental in photonic systems. Today they require magnetic materials that are bulky, costly and cannot be integrated. This is in stark contrast with most photonic devices, including sources, modulators, switches, waveguides, interconnects and antennas, which may be realized at the nanoscale. Here, we review recent progress and opportunities offered by temporal modulation to break reciprocity, revealing its potential for compact, low-energy, integrated non-reciprocal devices, and discuss the future of this exciting research field.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Dimitrios L.

letter,Continuous-wave lasing in an organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite semiconductor,"<p>Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising gain media for tunable, solution-processed semiconductor lasers. However, continuous-wave operation has not been achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate that optically pumped continuous-wave lasing can be sustained above threshold excitation intensities of ~17&#8201;kW&#8201;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup> for over an hour in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) distributed feedback lasers that are maintained below the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition temperature of T&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;160&#8201;K. In contrast with the lasing death phenomenon that occurs for pure tetragonal-phase MAPbI<sub>3</sub> at T&#8201;&gt;&#8201;160&#8201;K (ref. ), we find that continuous-wave gain becomes possible at T&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;100&#8201;K from tetragonal-phase inclusions that are photogenerated by the pump within the normally existing, larger-bandgap orthorhombic host matrix. In this mixed-phase system, the tetragonal inclusions function as carrier recombination sinks that reduce the transparency threshold, in loose analogy to inorganic semiconductor quantum wells, and may serve as a model for engineering improved perovskite gain media.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yufei Jia"", "",\u00a0Alex J.

letter,Self-starting harmonic frequency comb generation in a quantum cascade laser,"<p>Optical frequency combs establish a rigid phase-coherent link between microwave and optical domains and are emerging as high-precision tools in an increasing number of applications. Frequency combs with large intermodal spacing are employed in the field of microwave photonics for radiofrequency arbitrary waveform synthesis and for the generation of terahertz tones of high spectral purity in future wireless communication networks. Here, we demonstrate self-starting harmonic frequency comb generation with a terahertz repetition rate in a quantum cascade laser. The large intermodal spacing caused by the suppression of tens of adjacent cavity modes originates from a parametric contribution to the gain due to temporal modulations of population inversion in the laser. Using multiheterodyne self-detection, the mode spacing of the harmonic comb is shown to be uniform to within 5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;12</sup> parts of the central frequency.

article,Attosecond electron pulse trains and quantum state reconstruction in ultrafast transmission electron microscopy,"<p>Ultrafast electron and X-ray imaging and spectroscopy are the basis for an ongoing revolution in the understanding of dynamical atomic-scale processes in matter. The underlying technology relies heavily on laser science for the generation and characterization of ever shorter pulses. Recent findings suggest that ultrafast electron microscopy with attosecond-structured wavefunctions may be feasible. However, such future technologies call for means to both prepare and fully analyse the corresponding free-electron quantum states. Here, we introduce a framework for the preparation, coherent manipulation and characterization of free-electron quantum states, experimentally demonstrating attosecond electron pulse trains. Phase-locked optical fields coherently control the electron wavefunction along the beam direction. We establish a new variant of quantum state tomography&#8212;&#8216;SQUIRRELS&#8217;&#8212;for free-electron ensembles.

article,Chalcogenide glass-on-graphene photonics,"<p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials are of tremendous interest to integrated photonics, given their singular optical characteristics spanning light emission, modulation, saturable absorption and nonlinear optics. To harness their optical properties, these atomically thin materials are usually attached onto prefabricated devices via a transfer process. Here, we present a new route for 2D material integration with planar photonics. Central to this approach is the use of chalcogenide glass, a multifunctional material that can be directly deposited and patterned on a wide variety of 2D materials and can simultaneously function as the light-guiding medium, a gate dielectric and a passivation layer for 2D materials. Besides achieving improved fabrication yield and throughput compared with the traditional transfer process, our technique also enables unconventional multilayer device geometries optimally designed for enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions in the 2D layers. Capitalizing on this facile integration method, we demonstrate a series of high-performance glass-on-graphene devices including ultra-broadband on-chip polarizers, energy-efficient thermo-optic switches, as well as graphene-based mid-infrared waveguide-integrated photodetectors and modulators.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science & Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hongtao Lin"", "",\u00a0Yizhong Huang"", "",\u00a0Derek Kita"", "",\u00a0Skylar Deckoff-Jones"", "",\u00a0Kaiqi Wang"", "",\u00a0Lan Li"", "",\u00a0Junying Li"", "",\u00a0Hanyu Zheng"", "",\u00a0Zhengqian Luo"", "",\u00a0Tian Gu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Juejun Hu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yi Song"", "",\u00a0Haozhe Wang"", "",\u00a0Ren-Jye Shiue"", "",\u00a0Dirk Englund"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jing Kong""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electronic Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China"", ""authors"": [""Yizhong Huang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zhengqian Luo""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology & System, Education Ministry of China, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China"", ""authors"": [""Junying Li""]}, {""address"": ""The College of Optics & Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32816, FL, USA"", ""authors"": [""Spencer Novak"", "",\u00a0Anupama Yadav"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kathleen Richardson""]}, {""address"": ""Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1TW, UK"", ""authors"": [""Chung-Che Huang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Daniel Hewak""]}]",False,"[""Hongtao Lin"", ""Yi Song"", ""Yizhong Huang"", ""Derek Kita"", ""Skylar Deckoff-Jones"", ""Kaiqi Wang"", ""Lan Li"", ""Junying Li"", ""Hanyu Zheng"", ""Zhengqian Luo"", ""Haozhe Wang"", ""Spencer Novak"", ""Anupama Yadav"", ""Chung-Che Huang"", ""Ren-Jye Shiue"", ""Dirk Englund"", ""Tian Gu"", ""Daniel Hewak"", ""Kathleen Richardson"", ""Jing Kong"", ""Juejun Hu""]","Lin, H., Song, Y., Huang, Y. et al.

article,Plasmonic coupling at a metal/semiconductor interface,"<p>Integrating plasmonic nanoparticles with semiconductor substrates introduces strong optical resonances that extend and enhance the spectrum of photocatalytic and photovoltaic activity. The effect of plasmonic resonances has been variously attributed to the field nanoconfinement, plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling, hot electron transfer, and so on, based on action spectra of enhanced photoactivity. It remains unclear, however, whether energized carriers in the substrate are generated by the transfer of plasmonically generated hot electrons from the metal, as broadly believed, or directly by dephasing of the plasmonic field at the interface. Here, we demonstrate the importance of the direct plasmonic coupling across the chemical interface for hot electron generation at a prototypical Ag nanocluster/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterojunction by direct probing of the coherence and hot electron dynamics with two-photon photoemission spectroscopy. Energy, time and material distributions of excitations in the Ag nanocluster/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterojunction indicate that dielectric coupling with the substrate renormalizes the plasmon resonance of the Ag nanoparticle, and its dephasing directly generates hot electrons in TiO<sub>2</sub> on a &lt;10&#8201;fs timescale.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy and Pittsburgh Quantum Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Shijing Tan"", "",\u00a0Adam Argondizzo"", "",\u00a0Jindong Ren"", "",\u00a0Jin Zhao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hrvoje Petek""]}, {""address"": ""ICQD/Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Jin Zhao""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Strongly-Coupled Quantum Matter Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Jin Zhao""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Liming Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jin Zhao""]}, {""address"": ""Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information & Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"", ""authors"": [""Jin Zhao""]}]",False,"[""Shijing Tan"", ""Adam Argondizzo"", ""Jindong Ren"", ""Liming Liu"", ""Jin Zhao"", ""Hrvoje Petek""]","Tan, S., Argondizzo, A., Ren, J. et al.
