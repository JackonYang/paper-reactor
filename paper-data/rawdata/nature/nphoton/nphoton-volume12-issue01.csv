review article,X-ray ptychography,"<p>X-ray ptychographic microscopy combines the advantages of raster scanning X-ray microscopy with the more recently developed techniques of coherent diffraction imaging. It is limited neither by the fabricational challenges associated with X-ray optics nor by the requirements of isolated specimen preparation, and offers in principle wavelength-limited resolution, as well as stable access and solution to the phase problem. In this Review, we discuss the basic principles of X-ray ptychography and summarize the main milestones in the evolution of X-ray ptychographic microscopy and tomography over the past ten years, since its first demonstration with X-rays.

letter,Decoherence-protected memory for a single-photon qubit,"<p>Distributed quantum computation in a quantum network is based on the idea that qubits can be preserved and efficiently exchanged between long-lived, stationary network nodes via photonic links. Although long qubit lifetimes have been observed, and non-qubit excitations have been memorized, the long-lived storage and efficient retrieval of a photonic qubit by means of a light&#8211;matter interface remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we report on a qubit memory based on a single atom coupled to a high-finesse optical resonator. By mapping the qubit between an interface basis with strong light&#8211;matter coupling and a memory basis with low decoherence, we achieve a coherence time exceeding 100&#8201;ms with a time-independent storage-and-retrieval efficiency of 22%. The former constitutes an improvement by two orders of magnitude and thus implements an efficient photonic qubit memory with a coherence time that exceeds the lower bound needed for direct qubit teleportation in a global quantum internet.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Garching, Germany"", ""authors"": [""M.

letter,Broadband gate-tunable terahertz plasmons in graphene heterostructures,"<p>Graphene, a unique two-dimensional material comprising carbon in a honeycomb lattice, has brought breakthroughs across electronics, mechanics and thermal transport, driven by the quasiparticle Dirac fermions obeying a linear dispersion. Here, we demonstrate a counter-pumped all-optical difference frequency process to coherently generate and control terahertz plasmons in atomic-layer graphene with octave-level tunability and high efficiency. We leverage the inherent surface asymmetry of graphene for strong second-order nonlinear polarizability, which, together with tight plasmon field confinement, enables a robust difference frequency signal at terahertz frequencies. The counter-pumped resonant process on graphene uniquely achieves both energy and momentum conservation. Consequently, we demonstrate a dual-layer graphene heterostructure with terahertz charge- and gate-tunability over an octave, from 4.7&#8201;THz to 9.4&#8201;THz, bounded only by the pump amplifier optical bandwidth. Theoretical modelling supports our single-volt-level gate tuning and optical-bandwidth-bounded 4.7&#8201;THz phase-matching measurements through the random phase approximation, with phonon coupling, saturable absorption and below the Landau damping, to predict and understand graphene plasmon physics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Fang Lu Mesoscopic Optics and Quantum Electronics Laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Baicheng Yao"", "",\u00a0Shu-Wei Huang"", "",\u00a0Chanyeol Choi"", "",\u00a0Zhenda Xie"", "",\u00a0Jaime Flor Flores"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Chee Wei Wong""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications (Education Ministry of China), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"", ""authors"": [""Baicheng Yao"", "",\u00a0Yu Wu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yunjiang Rao""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yuan Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yu Huang""]}, {""address"": ""California Nanosystems Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yuan Liu"", "",\u00a0Yu Huang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xiangfeng Duan""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Mingbin Yu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dim-Lee Kwong""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiangfeng Duan""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA"", ""authors"": [""Shu-Wei Huang""]}]",False,"[""Baicheng Yao"", ""Yuan Liu"", ""Shu-Wei Huang"", ""Chanyeol Choi"", ""Zhenda Xie"", ""Jaime Flor Flores"", ""Yu Wu"", ""Mingbin Yu"", ""Dim-Lee Kwong"", ""Yu Huang"", ""Yunjiang Rao"", ""Xiangfeng Duan"", ""Chee Wei Wong""]","Yao, B., Liu, Y., Huang, S. et al.

letter,Reversible optical control of macroscopic polarization in ferroelectrics,"<p>The optical control of ferroic properties is a subject of fascination for the scientific community, because it involves the establishment of new paradigms for technology. Domains and domain walls are known to have a great impact on the properties of ferroic materials. Progress is currently being made in understanding the behaviour of the ferroelectric domain wall, especially regarding its dynamic control. New research is being conducted to find effective methodologies capable of modulating ferroelectric domain motion for future electronics. However, the practical use of ferroelectric domain wall motion should be both stable and reversible (rewritable) and, in particular, be able to produce a macroscopic response that can be monitored easily. Here, we show that it is possible to achieve a reversible optical change of ferroelectric domains configuration. This effect leads to the tuning of macroscopic polarization and its related properties by means of polarized light, a non-contact external control. Although this is only the first step, it nevertheless constitutes the most crucial one in the long and complex process of developing the next generation of photo-stimulated ferroelectric devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electroceramics, Instituto de Cer\u00e1mica y Vidrio \u2013 CSIC, Madrid, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Fernando Rubio-Marcos"", "",\u00a0Adolfo Del Campo"", "",\u00a0Miguel A.

article,Three-dimensional holographic optical manipulation through a high-numerical-aperture soft-glass multimode fibre,"<p>Holographic optical tweezers (HOT) hold great promise for many applications in biophotonics, allowing the creation and measurement of minuscule forces on biomolecules, molecular motors and cells. Geometries used in HOT currently rely on bulk optics, and their exploitation in vivo is compromised by the optically turbid nature of tissues. We present an alternative HOT approach in which multiple three-dimensional (3D)&#160;traps are introduced through a high-numerical-aperture multimode optical fibre, thus enabling an equally versatile means of manipulation through channels having cross-section comparable to the size of a single cell. Our work demonstrates real-time manipulation of 3D&#160;arrangements of micro-objects, as well as manipulation inside otherwise inaccessible cavities. We show that the traps can be formed over fibre lengths exceeding 100&#8201;mm and positioned with nanometric resolution. The results provide the basis for holographic manipulation and other high-numerical-aperture techniques, including advanced microscopy, through single-core-fibre endoscopes deep inside living tissues and other complex environments.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""SUPA, School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, Nethergate, Dundee, UK"", ""authors"": [""Ivo T.

article,Room-temperature ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy of a single molecule,"<p>Single-molecule spectroscopy aims to unveil often hidden but potentially very important contributions of single entities to a system&#8217;s ensemble response. Albeit contributing tremendously to our ever growing understanding of molecular processes, the fundamental question of temporal evolution, or change, has thus far been inaccessible, thus painting a static picture of a dynamic world. Here, we finally resolve this dilemma by performing ultrafast time-resolved transient spectroscopy on a single molecule. By tracing the femtosecond evolution of excited electronic state spectra of single molecules over hundreds of nanometres of bandwidth at room temperature, we reveal their nonlinear ultrafast response in an effective three-pulse scheme with fluorescence detection. A first excitation pulse is followed by a phase-locked de-excitation pulse pair, providing spectral encoding with 25&#8201;fs temporal resolution. This experimental realization of true single-molecule transient spectroscopy demonstrates that two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of single molecules is experimentally within reach.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO - Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Matz Liebel"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Niek F. van Hulst""]}, {""address"": ""CNR-INO, Istituto Nazionale di Ottica, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Costanza Toninelli""]}, {""address"": ""LENS, Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, 50019, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Costanza Toninelli""]}, {""address"": ""ICREA - Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avanats, Pg.

article,Active tuning of surface phonon polariton resonances via carrier photoinjection,"<p>Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) are attractive alternatives to infrared plasmonics for subdiffractional confinement of infrared light. Localized SPhP resonances in semiconductor nanoresonators are narrow, but that linewidth and the limited extent of the Reststrahlen band limit spectral coverage. To address this limitation, we report active tuning of SPhP resonances in InP and 4H-SiC by photoinjecting free carriers into nanoresonators, taking advantage of the coupling between the carrier plasma and optic phonons to blueshift SPhP resonances. We demonstrate state-of-the-art tuning figures of merit upon continuous-wave excitation (in InP) or pulsed excitation (in 4H-SiC). Lifetime effects cause the tuning to saturate in InP, and carrier redistribution leads to rapid (&lt;50&#8201;ps) recovery of the resonance in 4H-SiC. This work demonstrates the potential for this method and opens a path towards actively tuned nanophotonic devices, such as modulators and beacons, in the infrared, and identifies important implications of coupling between electronic and phononic excitations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""US Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA"", ""authors"": [""Adam D.
