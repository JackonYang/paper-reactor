letter,Far-field nanoscopy on a semiconductor quantum dot via a rapid-adiabatic-passage-based switch,"<p>The diffraction limit prevents a conventional optical microscope from imaging at the nanoscale. However, nanoscale imaging of molecules is possible by exploiting an intensity-dependent molecular switch. This switch is translated into a microscopy scheme, stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Variants on this scheme exist, yet all exploit an incoherent response to the lasers. We present a scheme that relies on a coherent response to a laser. Quantum control of a two-level system proceeds via rapid adiabatic passage, an ideal molecular switch. We implement this scheme on an ensemble of quantum dots. Each quantum dot results in a bright spot in the image with extent down to 30&#8201;nm (&#955;/31). There is no significant loss of intensity with respect to confocal microscopy, resulting in a factor of 10 improvement in emitter position determination. The experiments establish rapid adiabatic passage as a versatile tool in the super-resolution toolbox.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Timo Kaldewey"", "",\u00a0Andreas V.

letter,Large magneto-optical Kerr effect and imaging of magnetic octupole domains in an antiferromagnetic metal,"<p>The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) has been intensively studied in a variety of ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials as a powerful probe for electronic and magnetic properties and for magneto-optical technologies. The MOKE can be additionally useful for the investigation of the antiferromagnetic (AF) state, although thus far limited to insulators. Here, we report the first observation of the MOKE in an AF metal. In particular, we find that the non-collinear AF metal Mn<sub>3</sub>Sn (ref. ) exhibits a large zero-field Kerr rotation angle of 20 mdeg at room temperature, comparable to ferromagnetic metals. Our first-principles calculations clarify that ferroic ordering of magnetic octupoles produces a large MOKE even in its fully compensated AF state. This large MOKE further allows imaging of the magnetic octupole domains and their reversal. The observation of a large MOKE in an AF metal will open new avenues for the study of domain dynamics as well as spintronics using antiferromagnets.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Tomoya Higo"", "",\u00a0Huiyuan Man"", "",\u00a0Muhammad Ikhlas"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Satoru Nakatsuji""]}, {""address"": ""CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Tomoya Higo"", "",\u00a0Takashi Koretsune"", "",\u00a0Michi-To Suzuki"", "",\u00a0Muhammad Ikhlas"", "",\u00a0Ryotaro Arita"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Satoru Nakatsuji""]}, {""address"": ""Materials Science and Engineering Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA"", ""authors"": [""Daniel B.

letter,Large optical nonlinearity of nanoantennas coupled to an epsilon-near-zero material,"<p>The size and operating energy of a nonlinear optical device are fundamentally constrained by the weakness of the nonlinear optical response of common materials. Here, we report that a 50-nm-thick optical metasurface made of optical dipole antennas coupled to an epsilon-near-zero material exhibits a broadband (&#8764;400&#8201;nm bandwidth) and ultrafast (recovery time less than 1 ps) intensity-dependent refractive index n<sub>2</sub> as large as &#8722;3.73&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.56&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>&#8201;GW<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. Furthermore, the metasurface exhibits a maximum optically induced refractive index change of &#177;2.5 over a spectral range of &#8764;200&#8201;nm. The inclusion of low-Q nanoantennas on an epsilon-near-zero thin film not only allows the design of a metasurface with an unprecedentedly large nonlinear optical response, but also offers the flexibility to tailor the sign of the response. Our technique removes a longstanding obstacle in nonlinear optics: the lack of materials with an ultrafast nonlinear contribution to refractive index on the order of unity. It consequently offers the possibility to design low-power nonlinear nano-optical devices with orders-of-magnitude smaller footprints.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Wavefront shaping with disorder-engineered metasurfaces,"<p>Recently, wavefront shaping with disordered media has demonstrated optical manipulation capabilities beyond those of conventional optics, including extended volume, aberration-free focusing and subwavelength focusing. However, translating these capabilities to useful applications has remained challenging as the input&#8211;output characteristics of the disordered media (P variables) need to be exhaustively determined via O(P) measurements. Here, we propose a paradigm shift where the disorder is specifically designed so its exact input&#8211;output characteristics are known a priori and can be used with only a few alignment steps. We implement this concept with a disorder-engineered metasurface, which exhibits additional unique features for wavefront shaping such as a large optical memory effect range in combination with a wide angular scattering range, excellent stability, and a tailorable angular scattering profile. Using this designed metasurface with wavefront shaping, we demonstrate high numerical aperture (NA&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.5) focusing and fluorescence imaging with an estimated ~2.2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>8</sup> addressable points in an ~8&#8201;mm field of view.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Mooseok Jang"", "",\u00a0Atsushi Shibukawa"", "",\u00a0Joshua Brake"", "",\u00a0Yan Liu"", "",\u00a0Haowen Ruan"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Changhuei Yang""]}, {""address"": ""T.

article,Time-reversal symmetry breaking with acoustic pumping of nanophotonic circuits,"<p>Achieving non-reciprocal light propagation via stimuli that break time-reversal symmetry, without magneto-optics, remains a major challenge for integrated nanophotonic devices. Recently, optomechanical microsystems in which light and vibrational modes are coupled through ponderomotive forces have demonstrated strong non-reciprocal effects through a variety of techniques, but always using optical pumping. None of these approaches has demonstrated bandwidth exceeding that of the mechanical system, and all of them require optical power; these are both fundamental and practical issues. Here, we resolve both challenges by breaking time-reversal symmetry using a two-dimensional acoustic pump that simultaneously provides a non-zero overlap integral for light&#8211;sound interaction and also satisfies the necessary phase-matching. We use this technique to produce a non-reciprocal modulator (a frequency shifting isolator) by means of indirect interband scattering. We demonstrate mode conversion asymmetry up to 15&#8201;dB and efficiency as high as 17% over a bandwidth exceeding 1&#8201;GHz.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Mechanical Science and Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"", ""authors"": [""Donggyu B.

article,High-efficiency electroluminescence and amplified spontaneous emission from a thermally activated delayed fluorescent near-infrared emitter,"<p>Near-infrared organic light-emitting diodes and semiconductor lasers could benefit a variety of applications including night-vision displays, sensors and information-secured displays. Organic dyes can generate electroluminescence efficiently at visible wavelengths, but organic light-emitting diodes are still underperforming in the near-infrared region. Here, we report thermally activated delayed fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes that operate at near-infrared wavelengths with a maximum external quantum efficiency of nearly 10% using a boron difluoride curcuminoid derivative. As well as an effective upconversion from triplet to singlet excited states due to the non-adiabatic coupling effect, this donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor compound also exhibits efficient amplified spontaneous emission. By controlling the polarity of the active medium, the maximum emission wavelength of the electroluminescence spectrum can be tuned from 700 to 780&#8201;nm. This study represents an important advance in near-infrared organic light-emitting diodes and the design of alternative molecular architectures for photonic applications based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics Research (OPERA), Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Dae-Hyeon Kim"", "",\u00a0Atula D.

article,Tandem luminescent solar concentrators based on engineered quantum dots,"<p>Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) can serve as large-area sunlight collectors for terrestrial and space-based photovoltaics. Due to their high emission efficiencies and readily tunable emission and absorption spectra, colloidal quantum dots have emerged as a new and promising type of LSC fluorophore. Spectral tunability of the quantum dots also facilitates the realization of stacked multilayered LSCs, where enhanced performance is obtained through spectral splitting of incident sunlight, as in multijunction photovoltaics. Here, we demonstrate a large-area (&gt;230&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>) tandem LSC based on two types of nearly reabsorption-free quantum dots spectrally tuned for optimal solar-spectrum splitting. This prototype device exhibits a high optical quantum efficiency of 6.4% for sunlight illumination and solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of 3.1%. The efficiency gains due to the tandem architecture over single-layer devices quickly increase with increasing LSC size and can reach more than 100% in structures with window sizes of more than 2,500&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre for Advanced Solar Photophysics, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kaifeng Wu"", "",\u00a0Hongbo Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Victor I.

article,High-speed optical coherence tomography by circular interferometric ranging,"<p>Existing three-dimensional optical imaging methods excel in controlled environments, but are difficult to deploy over large, irregular and dynamic fields. This means that they can be  ill-suited for use in areas such as material inspection and medicine. To better address these applications, we developed methods in optical coherence tomography to efficiently interrogate sparse scattering fields, that is, those in which most locations (voxels) do not generate meaningful signal. Frequency comb sources are used to superimpose reflected signals from equispaced locations through optical subsampling. This results in circular ranging, and reduces the number of measurements required to interrogate large volumetric fields. As a result, signal acquisition barriers that have limited speed and field in optical coherence tomography are avoided. With a new ultrafast, time-stretched frequency comb laser design operating with 7.6&#8201;MHz to 18.9&#8201;MHz repetition rates, we achieved imaging of multi-cm<sup>3</sup> fields at up to 7.5 volumes per second.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Meena Siddiqui"", "",\u00a0Serhat Tozburun"", "",\u00a0Norman Lippok"", "",\u00a0Cedric Blatter"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Benjamin J.
