review article,Next-generation organic photovoltaics based on non-fullerene acceptors,"<p>Over the past three years, a particularly exciting and active area of research within the field of organic photovoltaics has been the use of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Compared with fullerene acceptors, NFAs possess significant advantages including tunability of bandgaps, energy levels, planarity and crystallinity. To date, NFA solar cells have not only achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies of ~13&#8211;14%, but have also shown excellent stability compared with traditional fullerene acceptor solar cells. This Review highlights recent progress on single-junction and tandem NFA solar cells and research directions to achieve even higher efficiencies of 15&#8211;20% using NFA-based organic photovoltaics are also proposed.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Pei Cheng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yang Yang""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"", ""authors"": [""Gang Li""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Key Laboratory of Polymer Chemistry and Physics of Ministry of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Xiaowei Zhan""]}]",False,"[""Pei Cheng"", ""Gang Li"", ""Xiaowei Zhan"", ""Yang Yang""]","Cheng, P., Li, G., Zhan, X. et al.

letter,Universal impedance matching and the perfect transmission of white light,"<p>Light is reflected at the interface between heterogeneous media due to the mismatch of impedance. Removing this mismatch using additional materials, a technique known as anti-reflection, has so far been restricted to specific frequencies and incidence angles. The anti-reflection of white light, which requires the simultaneous matching of impedance over extremely wide angular and spectral ranges, has until now been considered impossible. Here, we develop a theory of universal impedance matching and introduce a matching layer that enables the perfect transmission of white light. The ability of a matching layer to assist in omnidirectional and frequency-independent anti-reflection has been confirmed analytically and numerically. We explain the feasibility of a universal matching layer using metamaterials, and demonstrate a transmission rate of over 99% for white light in the visible range with a double-layered dielectric metamaterial. This is confirmed experimentally by demonstrating the omnidirectional anti-reflection of microwaves in heterogeneous media.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Ku Im"", "",\u00a0Ji-Hun Kang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Q-Han Park""]}]",False,"[""Ku Im"", ""Ji-Hun Kang"", ""Q-Han Park""]","Im, K., Kang, J. & Park, Q.

letter,Femtosecond X-ray Fourier holography imaging of free-flying nanoparticles,"<p>Ultrafast X-ray imaging on individual fragile specimens such as aerosols, metastable particles, superfluid quantum systems and live biospecimens provides high-resolution information that is inaccessible with conventional imaging techniques. Coherent X-ray diffractive imaging, however, suffers from intrinsic loss of phase, and therefore structure recovery is often complicated and not always uniquely defined. Here, we introduce the method of in-flight holography, where we use nanoclusters as reference X-ray scatterers to encode relative phase information into diffraction patterns of a virus. The resulting hologram contains an unambiguous three-dimensional map of a virus and two nanoclusters with the highest lateral resolution so far achieved via single shot X-ray holography. Our approach unlocks the benefits of holography for ultrafast X-ray imaging of nanoscale, non-periodic systems and paves the way to direct observation of complex electron dynamics down to the attosecond timescale.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Optik und Atomare Physik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Tais Gorkhover"", "",\u00a0Anatoli Ulmer"", "",\u00a0Max Bucher"", "",\u00a0Maria M\u00fcller"", "",\u00a0Daniela Rupp"", "",\u00a0Mario Sauppe"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Thomas M\u00f6ller""]}, {""address"": ""Linac Coherent Light Source, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tais Gorkhover"", "",\u00a0Ken Ferguson"", "",\u00a0Max Bucher"", "",\u00a0Sebastian Carron"", "",\u00a0Jacek Krzywinski"", "",\u00a0Michelle Swiggers"", "",\u00a0Garth Williams"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christoph Bostedt""]}, {""address"": ""Stanford PULSE Institute, SLAC National Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Tais Gorkhover"", "",\u00a0Ken Ferguson"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christoph Bostedt""]}, {""address"": ""Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL, USA"", ""authors"": [""Max Bucher"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christoph Bostedt""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Filipe R.

letter,Activation of the surface dark-layer to enhance upconversion in a thermal field,"<p>Thermal quenching, in which light emission experiences a loss with increasing temperature, broadly limits luminescent efficiency at higher temperature in optical materials, such as lighting phosphors and fluorescent probes. Thermal quenching is commonly caused by the increased activity of phonons that leverages the non-radiative relaxation pathways. Here, we report a kind of heat-favourable phonons existing at the surface of lanthanide-doped upconversion nanomaterials to combat thermal quenching. It favours energy transfer from sensitizers to activators to pump up the intermediate excited-state upconversion process. We identify that the oxygen moiety chelating Yb<sup>3+</sup> ions, [Yb&#183;&#183;&#183;O], is the key underpinning this enhancement. We demonstrate an approximately 2,000-fold enhancement in blue emission for 9.7&#8201;nm Yb<sup>3+</sup>-Tm<sup>3+</sup> co-doped nanoparticles at 453&#8201;K. This strategy not only provides a powerful solution to illuminate the dark layer of ultra-small upconversion nanoparticles, but also suggests a new pathway to build high-efficiency upconversion systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Biomedical Materials and Devices (IBMD), Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Jiajia Zhou"", "",\u00a0Shihui Wen"", "",\u00a0Jiayan Liao"", "",\u00a0Christian Clarke"", "",\u00a0Sherif Abdulkader Tawfik"", "",\u00a0Wei Ren"", "",\u00a0Chao Mi"", "",\u00a0Fan Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dayong Jin""]}]",False,"[""Jiajia Zhou"", ""Shihui Wen"", ""Jiayan Liao"", ""Christian Clarke"", ""Sherif Abdulkader Tawfik"", ""Wei Ren"", ""Chao Mi"", ""Fan Wang"", ""Dayong Jin""]","Zhou, J., Wen, S., Liao, J. et al.

article,Bright colloidal quantum dot light-emitting diodes enabled by efficient chlorination,"<p>The external quantum efficiencies of state-of-the-art colloidal quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) are now approaching the limit set by the out-coupling efficiency. However, the brightness of these devices is constrained by the use of poorly conducting emitting layers, a consequence of the present-day reliance on long-chain organic capping ligands. Here, we report how conductive and passivating halides can be implemented in Zn chalcogenide-shelled colloidal quantum dots to enable high-brightness green QLEDs. We use a surface management reagent, thionyl chloride (SOCl<sub>2</sub>), to chlorinate the carboxylic group of oleic acid and graft the surfaces of the colloidal quantum dots with passivating chloride anions. This results in devices with an improved mobility that retain high external quantum efficiencies in the high-injection-current region and also feature a reduced turn-on voltage of 2.5&#8201;V. The treated QLEDs operate with a brightness of 460,000&#8201;cd&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, significantly exceeding that of all previously reported solution-processed LEDs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Xiyan Li"", "",\u00a0Yong-Biao Zhao"", "",\u00a0Fengjia Fan"", "",\u00a0Larissa Levina"", "",\u00a0Min Liu"", "",\u00a0Rafael Quintero-Bermudez"", "",\u00a0Xiwen Gong"", "",\u00a0Li Na Quan"", "",\u00a0James Fan"", "",\u00a0Zhenyu Yang"", "",\u00a0Sjoerd Hoogland"", "",\u00a0Oleksandr Voznyy"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Edward H.

article,Combined multi-plane phase retrieval and super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging for 4D cell microscopy,"<p>Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy provides unprecedented insight into cellular and subcellular structures. However, going &#8216;beyond the diffraction barrier&#8217; comes at a price, since most far-field super-resolution imaging techniques trade temporal for spatial super-resolution. We propose the combination of a novel label-free white light quantitative phase imaging with fluorescence to provide high-speed imaging and spatial super-resolution. The non-iterative phase retrieval relies on the acquisition of single images at each z-location and thus enables straightforward 3D phase imaging using a classical microscope. We realized multi-plane imaging using a customized prism for the simultaneous acquisition of eight planes. This allowed us to not only image live cells in 3D at up to 200&#8201;Hz, but also to integrate fluorescence super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging within the same optical instrument. The 4D microscope platform unifies the sensitivity and high temporal resolution of phase imaging with the specificity and high spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Laboratoire d\u2019Optique Biom\u00e9dicale, Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""A.

article,Experimental statistical signature of many-body quantum interference,"<p>Multi-particle interference is an essential ingredient for fundamental quantum mechanics phenomena and for quantum information processing to provide a computational advantage, as recently emphasized by boson sampling experiments. Hence, developing a reliable and efficient technique to witness its presence is pivotal in achieving the practical implementation of quantum technologies. Here, we experimentally identify genuine many-body quantum interference via a recent efficient protocol, which exploits statistical signatures at the output of a multimode quantum device. We successfully apply the test to validate three-photon experiments in an integrated photonic circuit, providing an extensive analysis on the resources required to perform it. Moreover, drawing upon established techniques of machine learning, we show how such tools help to identify the&#8212;a priori unknown&#8212;optimal features to witness these signatures. Our results provide evidence on the efficacy and feasibility of the method, paving the way for its adoption in large-scale implementations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Roma, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Taira Giordani"", "",\u00a0Fulvio Flamini"", "",\u00a0Matteo Pompili"", "",\u00a0Niko Viggianiello"", "",\u00a0Nicol\u00f2 Spagnolo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Fabio Sciarrino""]}, {""address"": ""Istituto di Fotonica e Nanotecnologie, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IFN-CNR), Milano, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Andrea Crespi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Roberto Osellame""]}, {""address"": ""Dipartimento di Fisica, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Andrea Crespi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Roberto Osellame""]}, {""address"": ""Station Q Quantum Architectures and Computation Group, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nathan Wiebe""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, CNRS, ENS-PSL Research University, Coll\u00e8ge de France, Paris, France"", ""authors"": [""Mattia Walschaers""]}, {""address"": ""Physikalisches Institut, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Mattia Walschaers"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andreas Buchleitner""]}]",False,"[""Taira Giordani"", ""Fulvio Flamini"", ""Matteo Pompili"", ""Niko Viggianiello"", ""Nicol\u00f2 Spagnolo"", ""Andrea Crespi"", ""Roberto Osellame"", ""Nathan Wiebe"", ""Mattia Walschaers"", ""Andreas Buchleitner"", ""Fabio Sciarrino""]","Giordani, T., Flamini, F., Pompili, M. et al.

article,Giant multiphoton absorption for THz resonances in silicon hydrogenic donors,"<p>The absorption of multiple photons when there is no resonant intermediate state is a well-known nonlinear process in atomic vapours, dyes and semiconductors. The N-photon absorption (NPA) rate for donors in semiconductors scales proportionally from hydrogenic atoms in vacuum with the dielectric constant and inversely with the effective mass, factors that carry exponents 6N and 4N, respectively, suggesting that extremely large enhancements are possible. We observed 1PA, 2PA and 3PA in Si:P with a terahertz free-electron laser. The 2PA coefficient for 1s&#8211;2s at 4.25&#8201;THz was 400,000,000&#8201;GM (=4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;42</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>4</sup>&#8201;s), many orders of magnitude larger than is available in other systems. Such high cross-sections allow us to enter a regime where the NPA cross-section exceeds that of 1PA&#8212;that is, when the intensity approaches the binding energy per Bohr radius squared divided by the uncertainty time (only 3.84&#8201;MW&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;</sup><sup>2</sup> in silicon)&#8212;and will enable new kinds of terahertz quantum control.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Radboud University, Institute for Molecules and Materials, FELIX Laboratory, Nijmegen, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""M.
