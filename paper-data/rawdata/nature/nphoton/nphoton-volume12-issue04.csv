article,Opto-thermoelectric nanotweezers,"<p>Optical manipulation of plasmonic nanoparticles provides opportunities for fundamental and technical innovation in nanophotonics. Optical heating arising from the photon-to-phonon conversion is considered as an intrinsic loss in metal nanoparticles, which limits their applications. We show here that this drawback can be turned into an advantage, by developing an extremely low-power optical tweezing technique, termed opto-thermoelectric nanotweezers. By optically heating a thermoplasmonic substrate, a light-directed thermoelectric field can be generated due to spatial separation of dissolved ions within the heating laser spot, which allows us to manipulate metal nanoparticles of a wide range of materials, sizes and shapes with single-particle resolution. In combination with dark-field optical imaging, nanoparticles can be selectively trapped and their spectroscopic response can be resolved in situ. With its simple optics, versatile low-power operation, applicability to diverse nanoparticles and tunable working wavelength, opto-thermoelectric nanotweezers will become a powerful tool in colloid science and nanotechnology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Linhan Lin"", "",\u00a0Mingsong Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yuebing Zheng""]}, {""address"": ""Materials Science and Engineering Program and Texas Materials Institute, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Linhan Lin"", "",\u00a0Xiaolei Peng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yuebing Zheng""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Nonlinear Dynamics, Department of Physics, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Emanuel N.

article,High-coherence mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy spanning 2.6 to 5.2 μm,"<p>Mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy has the potential to supplant conventional Fourier-transform spectroscopy in applications requiring high resolution, accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio and speed. Until now, mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy has been limited to narrow optical bandwidths or low signal-to-noise ratios. Using digital signal processing and broadband frequency conversion in waveguides, we demonstrate a mid-infrared dual-comb spectrometer covering 2.6 to 5.2&#8201;&#181;m with comb-tooth resolution, sub-MHz frequency precision and accuracy, and a spectral signal-to-noise ratio as high as 6,500. As a demonstration, we measure the highly structured, broadband cross-section of propane from 2,840 to 3,040&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, the complex phase/amplitude spectra of carbonyl sulfide from 2,000 to 2,100&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, and of a methane, acetylene and ethane mixture from 2,860 to 3,400&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

article,Massively parallel sensing of trace molecules and their isotopologues with broadband subharmonic mid-infrared frequency combs,"<p>Mid-infrared spectroscopy offers supreme sensitivity for the detection of trace gases, solids and liquids based on tell-tale vibrational bands specific to this spectral region. Here, we present a new platform for mid-infrared dual-comb Fourier-transform spectroscopy based on a pair of ultra-broadband subharmonic optical parametric oscillators pumped by two phase-locked thulium-fibre combs. Our system provides fast (7&#8201;ms for a single interferogram), moving-parts-free, simultaneous acquisition of 350,000 spectral data points, spaced by a 115&#8201;MHz intermodal interval over the 3.1&#8211;5.5&#8201;&#181;m spectral range. Parallel detection of 22 trace molecular species in a gas mixture, including isotopologues containing isotopes such as <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>34</sup>S, <sup>33</sup>S and deuterium, with part-per-billion sensitivity and sub-Doppler resolution is demonstrated. The technique also features absolute optical frequency referencing to an atomic clock, a high degree of mutual coherence between the two mid-infrared combs with a relative comb-tooth linewidth of 25&#8201;mHz, coherent averaging and feasibility for kilohertz-scale spectral resolution.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CREOL, College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"", ""authors"": [""A.

article,Attosecond time–energy structure of X-ray free-electron laser pulses,"<p>The time&#8211;energy information of ultrashort X-ray free-electron laser pulses generated by the Linac Coherent Light Source is measured with attosecond resolution via angular streaking of neon 1s photoelectrons. The X-ray pulses promote electrons from the neon core level into an ionization continuum, where they are dressed with the electric field of a circularly polarized infrared laser. This induces characteristic modulations of the resulting photoelectron energy and angular distribution. From these modulations we recover the single-shot attosecond intensity structure and chirp of arbitrary X-ray pulses based on self-amplified spontaneous emission, which have eluded direct measurement so far. We characterize individual attosecond pulses, including their instantaneous frequency, and identify double pulses with well-defined delays and spectral properties, thus paving the way for X-ray pump/X-ray probe attosecond free-electron laser science.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Linac Coherent Light Source, Menlo Park, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""N.

article,Real-time full-field characterization of transient dissipative soliton dynamics in a mode-locked laser,"<p>Dissipative solitons are remarkably localized states of a physical system that arise from the dynamical balance between nonlinearity, dispersion and environmental energy exchange. They are the most universal form of soliton that can exist, and are seen in far-from-equilibrium systems in many fields, including chemistry, biology and physics. There has been particular interest in studying their properties in mode-locked lasers, but experiments have been limited by the inability to track the dynamical soliton evolution in real time. Here, we use simultaneous dispersive Fourier transform and time-lens measurements to completely characterize the spectral and temporal evolution of ultrashort dissipative solitons as their dynamics pass through a transient unstable regime with complex break-up and collisions before stabilization. Further insight is obtained from reconstruction of the soliton amplitude and phase and calculation of the corresponding complex-valued eigenvalue spectrum. These findings show how real-time measurements provide new insights into ultrafast transient dynamics in optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratory of Photonics, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"", ""authors"": [""P.

article,Single-shot measurement of phase and amplitude by using a heterodyne time-lens system and ultrafast digital time-holography,"<p>Temporal imaging systems are outstanding tools for single-shot observation of optical signals that have irregular and ultrafast dynamics. They allow long time windows to be recorded with femtosecond resolution, and do not rely on complex algorithms. However, simultaneous recording of amplitude and phase remains an open challenge for these systems. Here, we present a new heterodyne time-lens arrangement that efficiently records both the amplitude and phase of complex and random signals over large temporal windows (tens of picoseconds). Phase and time are encoded onto the two spatial dimensions of a camera. We implement this phase-sensitive time-lens system in two configurations: a time microscope and a digital temporal-holography device that enables single-shot measurement with a temporal resolution of ~80&#8201;fs. We demonstrate direct application of our heterodyne time-lens to turbulent-like optical fields and optical rogue waves generated from nonlinear propagation of partially coherent waves inside optical fibres.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers, Atomes et Molecules, UMR-CNRS 8523, Universit\u00e9 de Lille, Villeneuve-d\u2019Ascq, France"", ""authors"": [""Alexey Tikan"", "",\u00a0Serge Bielawski"", "",\u00a0Christophe Szwaj"", "",\u00a0St\u00e9phane Randoux"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Pierre Suret""]}, {""address"": ""Centre d\u2019Etudes et de Recherches Lasers et Applications (CERLA), Villeneuve-d\u2019Ascq, France"", ""authors"": [""Alexey Tikan"", "",\u00a0Serge Bielawski"", "",\u00a0Christophe Szwaj"", "",\u00a0St\u00e9phane Randoux"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Pierre Suret""]}]",False,"[""Alexey Tikan"", ""Serge Bielawski"", ""Christophe Szwaj"", ""St\u00e9phane Randoux"", ""Pierre Suret""]","Tikan, A., Bielawski, S., Szwaj, C. et al.

article,Diboron compound-based organic light-emitting diodes with high efficiency and reduced efficiency roll-off,"<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials are promising for the realization of highly efficient light emitters. However, such devices have so far suffered from efficiency roll-off at high luminance. Here, we report the design and synthesis of two diboron-based molecules, CzDBA and tBuCzDBA, which show excellent TADF properties and yield efficient OLEDs with very low efficiency roll-off. These donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type and rod-like compounds concurrently generate TADF with a photoluminescence quantum yield of ~100% and an 84% horizontal dipole ratio in the thin film. A green OLED based on CzDBA exhibits a high external quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6%, a current efficiency of 139.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.8&#8201;cd&#8201;A<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and a power efficiency of 121.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3.1&#8201;lm&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with an efficiency roll-off of only 0.3% at 1,000&#8201;cd&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. The device has a peak emission wavelength of 528&#8201;nm and colour coordinates of the Commission International de l&#180;Eclairage (CIE) of (0.31, 0.61), making it attractive for colour-display applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Chemistry, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"", ""authors"": [""Tien-Lin Wu"", "",\u00a0Min-Jie Huang"", "",\u00a0Chih-Chun Lin"", "",\u00a0Pei-Yun Huang"", "",\u00a0Rai-Shung Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Chien-Hong Cheng""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"", ""authors"": [""Tsu-Yu Chou"", "",\u00a0Ren-Wu Chen-Cheng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hao-Wu Lin""]}]",False,"[""Tien-Lin Wu"", ""Min-Jie Huang"", ""Chih-Chun Lin"", ""Pei-Yun Huang"", ""Tsu-Yu Chou"", ""Ren-Wu Chen-Cheng"", ""Hao-Wu Lin"", ""Rai-Shung Liu"", ""Chien-Hong Cheng""]","Wu, T., Huang, M., Lin, C. et al.

article,In situ 3D nanoprinting of free-form coupling elements for hybrid photonic integration,"<p>Hybrid photonic integration combines complementary advantages of different material platforms, offering superior performance and flexibility compared with monolithic approaches. This applies in particular to multi-chip concepts, where components can be individually optimized and tested. The assembly of such systems, however, requires expensive high-precision alignment and adaptation of optical mode profiles. We show that these challenges can be overcome by in situ printing of facet-attached beam-shaping elements. Our approach allows precise adaptation of vastly dissimilar mode profiles and permits alignment tolerances compatible with cost-efficient passive assembly techniques. We demonstrate a selection of beam-shaping elements at chip and fibre facets, achieving coupling efficiencies of up to 88% between edge-emitting lasers and single-mode fibres. We also realize printed free-form mirrors that simultaneously adapt beam shape and propagation direction, and we explore multi-lens systems for beam expansion. The concept paves the way to automated assembly of photonic multi-chip systems with unprecedented performance and versatility.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Microstructure Technology (IMT), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany"", ""authors"": [""P.-I.
