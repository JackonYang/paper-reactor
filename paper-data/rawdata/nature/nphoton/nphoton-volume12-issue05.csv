letter,Spatiotemporal control of laser intensity,"<p>The controlled coupling of a laser to plasma has the potential to address grand scientific challenges, but many applications have limited flexibility and poor control over the laser focal volume. Here, we present an advanced focusing scheme called a &#8216;flying focus&#8217;, where a chromatic focusing system combined with chirped laser pulses enables a small-diameter laser focus to propagate nearly 100 times its Rayleigh length. Furthermore, the speed at which the focus moves (and hence the peak intensity) is decoupled from the group velocity of the laser. It can co- or counter-propagate along the laser axis at any velocity. Experiments validating the concept measured subluminal (&#8722;0.09c) to superluminal (39c) focal-spot velocities, generating a nearly constant peak intensity over 4.5&#8201;mm. Among possible applications, the flying focus could be applied to a photon accelerator to mitigate dephasing, facilitating the production of tunable XUV sources.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratory for Laser Energetics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Dustin H.

letter,High-harmonic spectroscopy of ultrafast many-body dynamics in strongly correlated systems,"<p>We bring together two topics that, until now, have been the focus of intense but non-overlapping research efforts. The first concerns high-harmonic generation in solids, which occurs when an intense light field excites a highly non-equilibrium electronic response in a semiconductor or a dielectric. The second concerns many-body dynamics in strongly correlated systems such as the Mott insulator. We show that high-harmonic generation can be used to time-resolve ultrafast many-body dynamics associated with an optically driven phase transition, with accuracy far exceeding one cycle of the driving light field. Our work paves the way for time-resolving highly non-equilibrium many-body dynamics in strongly correlated systems, with few femtosecond accuracy.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Born-Institut, Berlin, Germany"", ""authors"": [""R.

article,Improved photovoltaic performance from inorganic perovskite oxide thin films with mixed crystal phases,"<p>Inorganic ferroelectric perovskites are attracting attention for the realization of highly stable photovoltaic cells with large open-circuit voltages. However, the power conversion efficiencies of devices have been limited so far. Here, we report a power conversion efficiency of ~4.20% under 1&#8201;sun illumination from Bi&#8211;Mn&#8211;O composite thin films with mixed BiMnO<sub>3</sub> and BiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> crystal phases. We show that the photocurrent density and photovoltage mainly develop across grain boundaries and interfaces rather than within the grains. We also experimentally demonstrate that the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit photocurrent measured in the films are tunable by varying the electrical resistance of the device, which in turn is controlled by externally applying voltage pulses. The exploitation of multifunctional properties of composite oxides provides an alternative route towards achieving highly stable, high-efficiency photovoltaic solar energy conversion.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre \u00c9nergie, Mat\u00e9riaux et T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS), Varennes, QC, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Joyprokash Chakrabartty"", "",\u00a0Catalin Harnagea"", "",\u00a0Mert Celikin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Federico Rosei""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Science, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"", ""authors"": [""Federico Rosei""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Riad Nechache""]}]",False,"[""Joyprokash Chakrabartty"", ""Catalin Harnagea"", ""Mert Celikin"", ""Federico Rosei"", ""Riad Nechache""]","Chakrabartty, J., Harnagea, C., Celikin, M. et al.

article,Focusing of light energy inside a scattering medium by controlling the time-gated multiple light scattering,"<p>The efficient delivery of light energy is a prerequisite for the non-invasive imaging and stimulating of target objects embedded deep within a scattering medium. However, the injected waves experience random diffusion by multiple light scattering, and only a small fraction reaches the target object. Here, we present a method to counteract wave diffusion and to focus multiple-scattered waves at the deeply embedded target. To realize this, we experimentally inject light into the reflection eigenchannels of a specific flight time to preferably enhance the intensity of those multiple-scattered waves that have interacted with the target object. For targets that are too deep to be visible by optical imaging, we demonstrate a more than tenfold enhancement in light energy delivery in comparison with ordinary wave diffusion cases. This work will lay a foundation to enhance the working depth of imaging, sensing and light stimulation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Seungwon Jeong"", "",\u00a0Ye-Ryoung Lee"", "",\u00a0Wonjun Choi"", "",\u00a0Sungsam Kang"", "",\u00a0Jin Hee Hong"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wonshik Choi""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Seungwon Jeong"", "",\u00a0Ye-Ryoung Lee"", "",\u00a0Wonjun Choi"", "",\u00a0Sungsam Kang"", "",\u00a0Jin Hee Hong"", "",\u00a0Jin-Sung Park"", "",\u00a0Hong-Gyu Park"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wonshik Choi""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Nano Science and Mechanical Engineering and Nanotechnology Research Center, Konkuk University, Chungbuk, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Yong-Sik Lim""]}]",False,"[""Seungwon Jeong"", ""Ye-Ryoung Lee"", ""Wonjun Choi"", ""Sungsam Kang"", ""Jin Hee Hong"", ""Jin-Sung Park"", ""Yong-Sik Lim"", ""Hong-Gyu Park"", ""Wonshik Choi""]","Jeong, S., Lee, Y., Choi, W. et al.

article,Silicon Mie resonators for highly directional light emission from monolayer MoS2,"<p>Controlling light emission from quantum emitters has important applications, ranging from solid-state lighting and displays to nanoscale single-photon sources. Optical antennas have emerged as promising tools to achieve such control right at the location of the emitter, without the need for bulky, external optics. Semiconductor nanoantennas are particularly practical for this purpose because simple geometries such as wires and spheres support multiple, degenerate optical resonances. Here, we start by modifying Mie scattering theory developed for plane wave illumination to describe scattering of dipole emission. We then use this theory and experiments to demonstrate several pathways to achieve control over the directionality, polarization state and spectral emission that rely on a coherent coupling of an emitting dipole to optical resonances of a silicon nanowire. A forward-to-backward ratio of 20 was demonstrated for the electric dipole emission at 680&#8201;nm from a monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> by optically coupling it to a silicon nanowire.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ahmet Fatih Cihan"", "",\u00a0Alberto G.

article,Ultimate waveform reproducibility of extreme-ultraviolet pulses by high-harmonic generation in quartz,"<p>Optical waveforms of light reproducible with subcycle precision underlie applications of lasers in ultrafast spectroscopies, quantum control of matter and light-based signal processing. Nonlinear upconversion of optical pulses via high-harmonic generation in gas media extends these capabilities to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). However, the waveform reproducibility of the generated EUV pulses in gases is inherently sensitive to intensity and phase fluctuations of the driving field. We used photoelectron interferometry to study the effects of intensity and carrier-envelope phase of an intense single-cycle optical pulse on the field waveform of EUV pulses generated in quartz nanofilms, and contrasted the results with those obtained in gas argon. The EUV waveforms generated in quartz were found to be virtually immune to the intensity and phase of the driving field, implying a non-recollisional character of the underlying emission mechanism. Waveform-sensitive photonic applications and precision measurements of fundamental processes in optics will benefit from these findings.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Garching, Germany"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Bridging ultrahigh-Q devices and photonic circuits,"<p>Optical microresonators are essential to a broad range of technologies and scientific disciplines. However, many of their applications rely on discrete devices to attain challenging combinations of ultra-low-loss performance (ultrahigh Q) and resonator design requirements. This prevents access to scalable fabrication methods for photonic integration and lithographic feature control. Indeed, finding a microfabrication bridge that connects ultrahigh-Q device functions with photonic circuits is a priority of the microcavity field. Here, an integrated resonator having a record Q factor over 200 million is presented. Its ultra-low-loss and flexible cavity design brings performance to integrated systems that has been the exclusive domain of discrete silica and crystalline microcavity devices. Two distinctly different devices are demonstrated: soliton sources with electronic repetition rates and high-coherence/low-threshold Brillouin lasers. This multi-device capability and performance from a single integrated cavity platform represents a critical advance for future photonic circuits and systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""T. J.

article,Fibre multi-wave mixing combs reveal the broken symmetry of Fermi–Pasta–Ulam recurrence,"<p>In optical fibres, weak modulations can grow at the expense of a strong pump to form a triangular comb of sideband pairs, until the process is reversed. Repeated cycles of such conversion and back-conversion constitute a manifestation of the universal nonlinear phenomenon known as Fermi&#8211;Pasta&#8211;Ulam recurrence. However, it remains a major challenge to observe the coexistence of different types of recurrences owing to the spontaneous symmetry-breaking nature of such a phenomenon. Here, we implement a novel non-destructive technique that allows the evolution in amplitude and phase of frequency modes to be reconstructed via post-processing of the fibre backscattered light. We clearly observe how control of the input modulation seed results in different recursive behaviours emerging from the phase-space structure dictated by the spontaneously broken symmetry. The proposed technique is an important tool to characterize other mixing processes and new regimes of rogue-wave formation and wave turbulence in fibre optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""University of Lille, CNRS, UMR 8523 - PhLAM - Physique des Lasers Atomes et Mol\u00e9cules, Lille, France"", ""authors"": [""Arnaud Mussot"", "",\u00a0Corentin Naveau"", "",\u00a0Matteo Conforti"", "",\u00a0Alexandre Kudlinski"", "",\u00a0Francois Copie"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Pascal Szriftgiser""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Engineering, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Stefano Trillo""]}]",False,"[""Arnaud Mussot"", ""Corentin Naveau"", ""Matteo Conforti"", ""Alexandre Kudlinski"", ""Francois Copie"", ""Pascal Szriftgiser"", ""Stefano Trillo""]","Mussot, A., Naveau, C., Conforti, M. et al.
