letter,Giant collimated gamma-ray flashes,"<p>Bright sources of high-energy electromagnetic radiation are widely employed in fundamental research, industry and medicine. This motivated the construction of Compton-based facilities planned to yield bright gamma-ray pulses with energies up to 20&#8201;MeV. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism based on the strongly amplified synchrotron emission that occurs when a sufficiently dense ultra-relativistic electron beam interacts with a millimetre-thickness conductor. For electron beam densities exceeding approximately 3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>19</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>, electromagnetic instabilities occur, and the ultra-relativistic electrons travel through self-generated electromagnetic fields as large as 10<sup>7</sup>&#8211;10<sup>8</sup> gauss. This results in the production of a collimated gamma-ray pulse with peak brilliance above 10<sup>25</sup> photons s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> mrad<sup>&#8722;2</sup> mm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> per 0.1% bandwidth, photon energies ranging from 200&#8201;keV to gigaelectronvolts and up to 60% electron-to-photon energy conversion efficiency.

article,Vacuum Bloch–Siegert shift in Landau polaritons with ultra-high cooperativity,"<p>A two-level system resonantly interacting with an a.c. magnetic or electric field constitutes the physical basis of diverse phenomena and technologies. However, Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s equation for this seemingly simple system can be solved exactly only under the rotating-wave approximation, which neglects the counter-rotating field component. When the a.c. field is sufficiently strong, this approximation fails, leading to a resonance-frequency shift known as the Bloch&#8211;Siegert shift. Here, we report the vacuum Bloch&#8211;Siegert shift, which is induced by the ultra-strong coupling of matter with the counter-rotating component of the vacuum fluctuation field in a cavity. Specifically, an ultra-high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas inside a high-Q terahertz cavity in a quantizing magnetic field revealed ultra-narrow Landau polaritons, which exhibited a vacuum Bloch&#8211;Siegert shift up to 40&#8201;GHz. This shift, clearly distinguishable from the photon-field self-interaction effect, represents a unique manifestation of a strong-field phenomenon without a strong field.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xinwei Li"", "",\u00a0Weilu Gao"", "",\u00a0Minhan Lou"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Junichiro Kono""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Motoaki Bamba""]}, {""address"": ""PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Motoaki Bamba""]}, {""address"": ""Argonne National Laboratories, Lemont, IL, USA"", ""authors"": [""Qi Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Station Q Purdue, and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"", ""authors"": [""Saeed Fallahi"", "",\u00a0Geoff C.

article,Mid-infrared frequency comb via coherent dispersive wave generation in silicon nitride nanophotonic waveguides,"<p>Mid-infrared optical frequency combs are of significant interest for molecular spectroscopy due to the large absorption of molecular vibrational modes on the one hand, and the ability to implement superior comb-based spectroscopic modalities with increased speed, sensitivity and precision on the other hand. Here, we demonstrate a simple, yet effective, method for the direct generation of mid-infrared optical frequency combs in the region from 2.5 to 4.0&#8201;&#956;m (that is, 2,500&#8211;4,000&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), covering a large fraction of the functional group region, from a conventional and compact erbium-fibre-based femtosecond laser in the telecommunication band (that is, 1.55&#8201;&#956;m). The wavelength conversion is based on dispersive wave generation within the supercontinuum process in an unprecedented large-cross-section silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) waveguide with the dispersion lithographically engineered. The long-wavelength dispersive wave can perform as a mid-infrared frequency comb, whose coherence is demonstrated via optical heterodyne measurements. Such an approach can be considered as an alternative option to mid-infrared frequency comb generation. Moreover, it has the potential to realize compact dual-comb spectrometers. The generated combs also have a fine teeth-spacing, making them suitable for gas-phase analysis.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements (LPQM), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Hairun Guo"", "",\u00a0Clemens Herkommer"", "",\u00a0Chuankun Zhang"", "",\u00a0Martin H.

article,Segmented terahertz electron accelerator and manipulator (STEAM),"<p>Acceleration and manipulation of electron bunches underlie most electron and X-ray devices used for ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy. New terahertz-driven concepts offer orders-of-magnitude improvements in field strengths, field gradients, laser synchronization and compactness relative to conventional radiofrequency devices, enabling shorter electron bunches and higher resolution with less infrastructure while maintaining high charge capacities (pC), repetition rates (kHz) and stability. We present a segmented terahertz electron accelerator and manipulator (STEAM) capable of performing multiple high-field operations on the six-dimensional phase space of ultrashort electron bunches. With this single device, powered by few-microjoule, single-cycle, 0.3&#8201;THz pulses, we demonstrate record terahertz acceleration of&#8201;&gt;30&#8201;keV, streaking with&#8201;&lt;10&#8201;fs resolution, focusing with&#8201;&gt;2&#8201;kT&#8201;m<sup>&#8211;1</sup> strength, compression to ~100&#8201;fs as well as real-time switching between these modes of operation.

article,Hydroxypropyl cellulose photonic architectures by soft nanoimprinting lithography,"<p>As contamination and environmental degradation increase, there is a huge demand for new eco-friendly materials. Despite its use for thousands of years, cellulose and its derivatives have gained renewed interest as favourable alternatives to conventional plastics, due to their abundance and lower environmental impact. Here, we report the fabrication of photonic and plasmonic structures by moulding hydroxypropyl cellulose into submicrometric periodic lattices, using soft lithography. This is an alternative way to achieve structural colour in this material, which is usually obtained by exploiting its chiral nematic phase. Cellulose-based photonic crystals are biocompatible and can be dissolved in water or not depending on the derivative employed. Patterned cellulose membranes exhibit tunable colours and may be used to boost the photoluminescence of a host organic dye. Furthermore, we show how metal coating these cellulose photonic architectures leads to plasmonic crystals with excellent optical properties acting as disposable surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy substrates.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut de Ci\u00e8ncia de Materials de Barcelona, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Barcelona, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Andr\u00e9 Espinha"", "",\u00a0Camilla Dore"", "",\u00a0Cristiano Matricardi"", "",\u00a0Maria Isabel Alonso"", "",\u00a0Alejandro R.

article,Polarization control of isolated high-harmonic pulses,"<p>High-harmonic generation driven by femtosecond lasers makes it possible to capture the fastest dynamics in molecules and materials. However, thus far, the shortest isolated attosecond pulses have only been produced with linear polarization, which limits the range of physics that can be explored. Here, we demonstrate robust polarization control of isolated extreme-ultraviolet pulses by exploiting non-collinear high-harmonic generation driven by two counter-rotating few-cycle laser beams. The circularly polarized supercontinuum is produced at a central photon energy of 33&#8201;eV with a transform limit of 190&#8201;as and a predicted linear chirp of 330&#8201;as. By adjusting the ellipticity of the two counter-rotating driving pulses simultaneously, we control the polarization state of isolated extreme-ultraviolet pulses&#8212;from circular through elliptical to linear polarization&#8212;without sacrificing conversion efficiency. Access to the purely circularly polarized supercontinuum, combined with full helicity and ellipticity control, paves the way towards attosecond metrology of circular dichroism.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Photonics Technologies, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"", ""authors"": [""Pei-Chi Huang"", "",\u00a0Jen-Ting Huang"", "",\u00a0Po-Yao Huang"", "",\u00a0Chih-Hsuan Lu"", "",\u00a0Shang-Da Yang"", "",\u00a0A.

article,Continuous transition between weak and ultrastrong coupling through exceptional points in carbon nanotube microcavity exciton–polaritons,"<p>Non-perturbative coupling of photons and excitons produces hybrid particles, exciton&#8211;polaritons, which have exhibited a variety of many-body phenomena in various microcavity systems. However, the vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS), which defines the strength of photon&#8211;exciton coupling, is usually a single constant for a given system. Here, we have developed a unique architecture in which excitons in an aligned single-chirality carbon nanotube film interact with cavity photons in polarization-dependent manners. The system reveals ultrastrong coupling (VRS up to 329&#8201;meV or a coupling-strength-to-transition-energy ratio of 13.3%) for polarization parallel to the nanotube axis, whereas VRS is absent for perpendicular polarization. Between these two extremes, VRS is continuously tunable through polarization rotation with exceptional points separating crossing and anticrossing. The points between exceptional points form equienergy arcs onto which the upper and lower polaritons coalesce. The demonstrated on-demand ultrastrong coupling provides ways to explore topological properties of polaritons and quantum technology applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Weilu Gao"", "",\u00a0Xinwei Li"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Junichiro Kono""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Engineering Science, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Motoaki Bamba""]}, {""address"": ""PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Motoaki Bamba""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Junichiro Kono""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Junichiro Kono""]}]",False,"[""Weilu Gao"", ""Xinwei Li"", ""Motoaki Bamba"", ""Junichiro Kono""]","Gao, W., Li, X., Bamba, M. et al.

article,Adaptive wavefront shaping for controlling nonlinear multimode interactions in optical fibres,"<p>Recent progress in wavefront shaping has enabled control of light propagation inside linear media to focus and image through scattering objects. In particular, light propagation in multimode fibres comprises complex intermodal interactions and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. Control of physical phenomena in multimode fibres and its applications are in their infancy, opening opportunities to take advantage of complex nonlinear modal dynamics. Here, we demonstrate a wavefront shaping approach for controlling nonlinear phenomena in multimode fibres. Using a spatial light modulator at the fibre input, real-time spectral feedback and a genetic algorithm optimization, we control a highly nonlinear multimode stimulated Raman scattering cascade and its interplay with four-wave mixing via a flexible implicit control on the superposition of modes coupled into the fibre. We show versatile spectrum manipulations including shifts, suppression, and enhancement of Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks. These demonstrations illustrate the power of wavefront shaping to control and optimize nonlinear wave propagation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"", ""authors"": [""Omer Tzang"", "",\u00a0Antonio M.
