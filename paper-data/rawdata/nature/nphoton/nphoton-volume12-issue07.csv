letter,Phase-matched extreme-ultraviolet frequency-comb generation,"<p>Laser-driven high-order harmonic generation provides spatially and temporally coherent tabletop sources of broadband extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) light. These sources typically operate at low repetition rates, f<sub>rep</sub>&#8201;&#8818;&#8201;100&#8201;kHz, where phase-matched HHG is readily achieved. However, many applications demand the improved counting statistics or frequency-comb precision afforded by high repetition rates, f<sub>rep</sub>&#8201;&gt;&#8201;10&#8201;MHz. Unfortunately, at such high f<sub>rep</sub>, phase matching is prevented by steady-state plasma accumulated in the generation volume, strongly limiting the XUV average power. Here, we use high-temperature gas mixtures as the generation medium to increase the gas translational velocity, thereby reducing the steady-state plasma in the laser focus. This allows phase-matched XUV emission inside a femtosecond enhancement cavity at f<sub>rep</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;77&#8201;MHz, enabling a record generated power of ~&#8201;2&#8201;mW in a single harmonic order. This power scaling opens up many demanding applications, including XUV frequency-comb spectroscopy of few-electron atoms and ions for precision tests of fundamental physical laws and constants.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""JILA, NIST and the University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"", ""authors"": [""Gil Porat"", "",\u00a0Christoph M.

letter,Giant optical anisotropy in a quasi-one-dimensional crystal,"<p>Optical anisotropy is a fundamental building block for linear and nonlinear optical components such as polarizers, wave plates, and phase-matching elements. In solid homogeneous materials, the strongest optical anisotropy is found in crystals such as calcite and rutile. Attempts to enhance anisotropic light&#8211;matter interaction often rely on artificial anisotropic micro/nanostructures (form birefringence). Here, we demonstrate rationally designed, giant optical anisotropy in single crystals of barium titanium sulfide (BaTiS<sub>3</sub>). This material shows an unprecedented, broadband birefringence of up to 0.76 in the mid- to long-wave infrared, as well as a large dichroism window with absorption edges at 1.6&#8201;&#956;m and 4.5&#8201;&#956;m for light with polarization along two crystallographic axes on an easily accessible cleavage plane. The unusually large anisotropy is a result of the quasi-one-dimensional structure, combined with rational selection of the constituent ions to maximize the polarizability difference along different axes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Shanyuan Niu"", "",\u00a0Yucheng Zhou"", "",\u00a0Thomas Orvis"", "",\u00a0Huaixun Huyan"", "",\u00a0Yang Liu"", "",\u00a0Han Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jayakanth Ravichandran""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Madison, WI, USA"", ""authors"": [""Graham Joe"", "",\u00a0Jad Salman"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mikhail A.

letter,Experimental observation of a polarization vortex at an optical bound state in the continuum,"<p>Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) are states supported by a photonic structure that are compatible with free-space radiation, yet become perfectly bound for one specific in-plane momentum and wavelength. Recently, it was predicted that light radiated by such modes around the BIC momentum&#8211;frequency condition should display a vortex in its far-field polarization profile, making the BIC topologically protected. Here, we study a one-dimensional grating supporting a transverse magnetic mode with a BIC near 700&#8201;nm wavelength, verifying the existence of the BIC using reflection measurements, which show a vanishing reflection feature. Using k-space polarimetry, we measure the full polarization state of reflection around the BIC, highlighting the presence of a topological vortex. We use an electromagnetic dipole model to explain the observed BIC through destructive interference between two radiation channels, characteristic of a Friedrich&#8211;Wintgen-type BIC. Our findings shed light on the origin of BICs and verify their topological nature.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Van der Waals-Zeeman Institute, Institute of Physics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Hugo M.

article,Enrichment of molecular antenna triplets amplifies upconverting nanoparticle emission,"<p>Efficient photon upconversion at low light intensities promises major advances in technologies spanning solar energy harvesting to deep-tissue biophotonics. Here, we discover the critical mechanisms that enable near-infrared dye antennas to significantly enhance performance in lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticle (UCNP) systems, and leverage these findings to design dye&#8211;UCNP hybrids with a 33,000-fold increase in brightness and a 100-fold increase in efficiency over bare UCNPs. We show that increasing the lanthanide content in the UCNPs shifts the primary energy donor from the dye singlet to its triplet, and the resultant triplet states then mediate energy transfer into the nanocrystals. Time-gated phosphorescence, density functional theory, singlet lifetimes and triplet-quenching experiments support these findings. This interplay between the excited-state populations in organic antennas and the composition of UCNPs presents new design rules that overcome the limitations of previous upconverting materials, enabling performances now relevant for photovoltaics, biophotonics and infrared detection.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""The Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""David J.

article,Topological protection of photonic mid-gap defect modes,"<p>Defect modes in two-dimensional periodic photonic structures have found use in diverse optical devices. For example, photonic crystal cavities confine optical modes to subwavelength volumes and can be used for enhancement of nonlinearity, lasing and cavity quantum electrodynamics. Defect-core photonic crystal fibres allow for supercontinuum generation and endlessly single-mode fibres with large cores. However, these modes are notoriously fragile: small structural change leads to significant detuning of resonance frequency and mode volume. Here, we show that photonic topological crystalline insulator structures can be used to topologically protect the mode frequency at mid-gap and minimize the volume of a photonic defect mode. We experimentally demonstrate this in a femtosecond-laser-written waveguide array by observing the presence of a topological zero mode confined to the corner of the array. The robustness of this mode is guaranteed by a topological invariant that protects zero-dimensional states embedded in a two-dimensional environment&#8212;a novel form of topological protection that has not been previously demonstrated.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jiho Noh"", "",\u00a0Matthew J.

article,Femtosecond laser crosslinking of the cornea for non-invasive vision correction,"<p>The prevalence of myopia has increased worldwide over the last 50 years. Its incidence in the United States and Europe is now almost twice that 50 years ago, and it is even more prevalent in East Asia. Spectacles and contact lenses remain the most common means of vision correction, but the permanent correction of refractive errors, by refractive surgery, has emerged as an attractive alternative. However, such surgery is an invasive procedure that may compromise corneal structure, and post-surgical complications have been reported. We propose a novel, non-invasive approach to permanent vision correction based on a different mode of laser&#8211;cornea interaction. Our approach induces the formation of a low-density plasma that produces reactive oxygen species, which react with the surrounding proteins, forming crosslinks and triggering spatially resolved changes in mechanical properties. We show that the proposed method changes the refractive power of the eye, and confirm its safety and stability.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Chao Wang"", "",\u00a0Mikhail Fomovsky"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sinisa Vukelic""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Guanxiong Miao""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Mariya Zyablitskaya""]}]",False,"[""Chao Wang"", ""Mikhail Fomovsky"", ""Guanxiong Miao"", ""Mariya Zyablitskaya"", ""Sinisa Vukelic""]","Wang, C., Fomovsky, M., Miao, G. et al.

article,Control of semiconductor emitter frequency by increasing polariton momenta,"<p>Light emission and absorption is fundamentally a joint property of both an emitter and its optical environment. Nevertheless, because of the much smaller momenta of photons compared with electrons at similar energies, the optical environment typically modifies only the emission/absorption rates, leaving the emitter transition frequencies practically an intrinsic property. We show here that surface polaritons, exemplified by graphene plasmons, but also valid for other types of polariton, enable substantial and tunable control of the transition frequencies of a nearby quantum well, demonstrating a sharp break with the emitter-centric view. Central to this result is the large momenta of surface polaritons that can approach the momenta of electrons and impart a pronounced non-local behaviour to the quantum well. This work facilitates non-vertical optical transitions in solids and empowers ongoing efforts to access such transitions in indirect-bandgap materials, such as silicon, as well as enriching the study of non-locality in photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Yaniv Kurman"", "",\u00a0Shai Tsesses"", "",\u00a0Meir Orenstein"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ido Kaminer""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nicholas Rivera"", "",\u00a0Thomas Christensen"", "",\u00a0Marin Solja\u010di\u0107"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0John D.

article,Gate-tunable third-order nonlinear optical response of massless Dirac fermions in graphene,"<p>Graphene with massless Dirac fermions can have exceptionally strong third-order optical nonlinearities. Yet reported values of nonlinear optical susceptibilities for third-harmonic generation (THG), four-wave mixing (FWM) and self-phase modulation vary over six orders of magnitude. Such variation likely arises from frequency-dependent resonance effects of different processes in graphene under different doping. Here, we report an experimental study of THG and FWM in graphene using gate tuning to adjust the doping level and vary the resonant condition. We find that THG and sum-frequency FWM are strongly enhanced in heavily doped graphene, while the difference-frequency FWM appears just the opposite. Difference-frequency FWM exhibited a novel divergence towards the degenerate case in undoped graphene, leading to a giant enhancement of the nonlinearity. The results are well supported by theory. Our full understanding of the diverse nonlinearity of graphene paves the way towards future design of graphene-based nonlinear optoelectronic devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of Surface Physics, Key Laboratory of Micro and Nano Photonic Structures (MOE), Department of Physics, and Institute for Nanoelectronic Devices and Quantum Computing, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"", ""authors"": [""Tao Jiang"", "",\u00a0Di Huang"", "",\u00a0Yuwei Shan"", "",\u00a0Yangfan Yi"", "",\u00a0Yunyun Dai"", "",\u00a0Lei Shi"", "",\u00a0Jian Zi"", "",\u00a0Yuen-Ron Shen"", "",\u00a0Wei-Tao Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shiwei Wu""]}, {""address"": ""Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, Jilin, China"", ""authors"": [""Jinluo Cheng""]}, {""address"": ""International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials, Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, and Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"", ""authors"": [""Xiaodong Fan"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Changgan Zeng""]}, {""address"": ""CAS Key Laboratory of Strongly-Coupled Quantum Matter Physics, and Department of Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"", ""authors"": [""Xiaodong Fan"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Changgan Zeng""]}, {""address"": ""State Key Laboratory for Mesoscopic Physics and School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Zhihong Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Kaihui Liu""]}, {""address"": ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing, China"", ""authors"": [""Lei Shi"", "",\u00a0Jian Zi"", "",\u00a0Wei-Tao Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shiwei Wu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""J.
