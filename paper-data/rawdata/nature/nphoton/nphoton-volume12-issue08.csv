letter,Macroscopic direct observation of optical spin-dependent lateral forces and left-handed torques,"<p>Observing and taming the effects arising from non-trivial light&#8211;matter interaction has always triggered scientists to better understand nature and develop photonic technologies. However, despite tremendous conceptual advances, so far there have been only a few experimental proposals to reveal unusual optomechanical manifestations that are hardly seen in everyday life, such as negative radiation pressure, transverse forces or left-handed torques. Here, we report naked-eye identification of spin-dependent lateral displacements of centimetre-sized objects endowed with structured birefringence. Left-handed macroscopic rotational motion is also reported. The unveiled effects ultimately rely on spin&#8211;orbit optical interactions and are driven by lateral force fields that are five orders of magnitude larger than those reported previously, as a result of the proposed design. By highlighting the spin&#8211;orbit optomechanics of anisotropic and inhomogeneous media, these results allow structured light&#8211;matter interaction to move from a scientific curiosity to a new asset for the optical manipulation toolbox.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, CNRS, Laboratoire Ondes et Mati\u00e8re d\u2019Aquitaine, Talence, France"", ""authors"": [""Hernando Magallanes"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Etienne Brasselet""]}]",False,"[""Hernando Magallanes"", ""Etienne Brasselet""]","Magallanes, H., Brasselet, E.

letter,Strong-field optoelectronics in solids,"<p>Perturbative optical nonlinearities induced by static electric fields have proven useful in visualizing dynamical function in systems including operating circuits, electric and magnetic domain walls, and biological matter, and in controlling light for applications in silicon photonics. Here, we extend field-induced second-harmonic generation to the non-perturbative regime. We demonstrate that static or transient fields up to terahertz (THz) frequencies applied to silicon and ZnO crystals generate even-order high harmonics. Images of the even harmonics confirm that static fields delivered with conventional electronics control the spatial properties of the high-harmonic emission. Extending our methodology to higher-harmonic photon energies paves the way for realizing active optics in the extreme ultraviolet and will allow imaging of operating electronic circuits, of Si-photonic devices and of other functional materials, with higher spatio-temporal resolution than perturbative methods. For THz spectroscopy, our method has the bandwidth to allow measurement of attosecond transients imprinted on THz waveforms.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""G.

letter,Single-source chip-based frequency comb enabling extreme parallel data transmission,"<p>The Internet today transmits hundreds of terabits per second, consumes 9% of all electricity worldwide and grows by 20&#8211;30% per year. To support capacity demand, massively parallel communication links are installed, not scaling favourably concerning energy consumption. A single frequency comb source may substitute many parallel lasers and improve system energy-efficiency. We present a frequency comb realized by a non-resonant aluminium-gallium-arsenide-on-insulator (AlGaAsOI) nanowaveguide with 66% pump-to-comb conversion efficiency, which is significantly higher than state-of-the-art resonant comb sources. This enables unprecedented high data-rate transmission for chip-based sources, demonstrated using a single-mode 30-core fibre. We show that our frequency comb can carry 661 Tbit s<sup>&#8211;1</sup> of data, equivalent to more than the total Internet traffic today. The comb is obtained by seeding the AlGaAsOI chip with 10-GHz picosecond pulses at a low pump power (85&#8201;mW), and this scheme is robust to temperature changes, is energy efficient and facilitates future integration with on-chip lasers or amplifiers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"", ""authors"": [""Hao Hu"", "",\u00a0Francesco Da Ros"", "",\u00a0Minhao Pu"", "",\u00a0Feihong Ye"", "",\u00a0Kasper Ingerslev"", "",\u00a0Edson Porto da Silva"", "",\u00a0Md.

letter,Nonlinear charge oscillation driven by a single-cycle light field in an organic superconductor,"<p>Application of an intense light field to solids produces enormous and ultrafast nonlinear phenomena such as high-harmonic generation and attosecond charge dynamics. These are distinct from conventional photonics. However, the main targets for investigation have been limited to insulators and semiconductors, although theoretical approaches have also been developed for correlated metals and superconductors. Here, in a layered organic superconductor, a nonlinear charge oscillation driven by a nearly single-cycle strong electric field of &gt;10&#8201;MV&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is observed as a stimulated emission. The charge oscillation is different from a linear response and ascribed to a polar charge oscillation with a period of &#8764;6&#8201;fs. This nonlinear polar charge oscillation is enhanced by critical fluctuations near a superconducting transition temperature and a critical end-point of first-order Mott transitions. Its observation on an ultrafast timescale of &#8764;10&#8201;fs clarifies that Coulomb repulsion plays an essential role in the superconductivity of organic superconductors.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Y.

letter,A phonon laser operating at an exceptional point,"<p>Non-Hermitian physical systems have attracted considerable attention lately for their unconventional behaviour around exceptional points (EPs)&#8212;spectral singularities at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. In particular, many new EP-related concepts such as unidirectional lasing and invisibility, as well as chiral transmission, have been realized. Given the progress in understanding the physics of EPs in various photonic structures, it is surprising that one of the oldest theoretical predictions associated with them, a remarkable broadening of the laser linewidth at an EP, has been probed only indirectly so far. Here, we fill this gap by steering a phonon laser through an EP in a compound optomechanical system formed by two coupled resonators. We observe a pronounced linewidth broadening of the mechanical lasing mode generated in one of the resonators when the system approaches the EP.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jing Zhang"", "",\u00a0Bo Peng"", "",\u00a0\u015eahin Kaya \u00d6zdemir"", "",\u00a0Guangming Zhao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Lan Yang""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Jing Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Quantum Information Science and Technology, BNRist, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Jing Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yu-xi Liu""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Theoretical Physics, Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Vienna, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Kevin Pichler"", "",\u00a0Dmitry O.

letter,Efficient light generation from enhanced inelastic electron tunnelling,"<p>Light emission from biased tunnel junctions has recently gained much attention owing to its unique potential to create ultracompact optical sources with terahertz modulation bandwidth. The emission originates from an inelastic electron tunnelling process in which electronic energy is transferred to surface plasmon polaritons and subsequently converted to radiation photons by an optical antenna. Because most of the electrons tunnel elastically, the emission efficiency is typically about 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>&#8211;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>. Here, we demonstrate efficient light generation from enhanced inelastic tunnelling using nanocrystals assembled into metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal junctions. The colour of the emitted light is determined by the optical antenna and thus can be tuned by the geometry of the junction structures. The efficiency of far-field free-space light generation reaches ~2%, showing an improvement of two orders of magnitude over previous work. This brings on-chip ultrafast and ultracompact light sources one step closer to reality.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Haoliang Qian"", "",\u00a0Jie Zhao"", "",\u00a0Dylan Lu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zhaowei Liu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of NanoEngineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Su-Wen Hsu"", "",\u00a0Kargal Gurunatha"", "",\u00a0Conor T.

article,Relativistic single-cycle tunable infrared pulses generated from a tailored plasma density structure,"<p>The availability of intense, ultrashort coherent radiation sources in the infrared region of the spectrum is enabling the generation of attosecond X-ray pulses via high-harmonic generation, pump&#8211;probe experiments in the &#8216;molecular fingerprint&#8217; region and opening up the area of relativistic infrared nonlinear optics of plasmas. These applications would benefit from multi-millijoule single-cycle pulses in the mid- to long-wavelength infrared region. Here, we present a new scheme capable of producing tunable relativistically intense, single-cycle infrared pulses from 5 to 14&#8201;&#956;m with a 1.7% conversion efficiency based on a photon frequency downshifting scheme that uses a tailored plasma density structure. The carrier-envelope phase of the long-wavelength infrared pulse is locked to that of the drive laser to within a few per cent. Such a versatile tunable infrared source may meet the demands of many cutting-edge applications in strong-field physics and greatly promote their development.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Particle and Radiation Imaging of Ministry of Education, Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Zan Nie"", "",\u00a0Chih-Hao Pai"", "",\u00a0Jianfei Hua"", "",\u00a0Yipeng Wu"", "",\u00a0Yang Wan"", "",\u00a0Jie Zhang"", "",\u00a0Zhi Cheng"", "",\u00a0Qianqian Su"", "",\u00a0Shuang Liu"", "",\u00a0Yue Ma"", "",\u00a0Xiaonan Ning"", "",\u00a0Yunxiao He"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wei Lu""]}, {""address"": ""University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Chaojie Zhang"", "",\u00a0Fei Li"", "",\u00a0Warren B.
