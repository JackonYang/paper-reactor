review article,Quantum technologies with optically interfaced solid-state spins,"<p>Spins of impurities in solids provide a unique architecture to realize quantum technologies. A quantum register of electron and nearby nuclear spins in the lattice encompasses high-fidelity state manipulation and readout, long-lived quantum memory, and long-distance transmission of quantum states by optical transitions that coherently connect spins and photons. These features, combined with solid-state device engineering, establish impurity spins as promising resources for quantum networks, information processing and sensing. Focusing on optical methods for the access and connectivity of single spins, we review recent progress in impurity systems such as colour centres in diamond and silicon carbide, rare-earth ions in solids and donors in silicon. We project a possible path to chip-scale quantum technologies through sustained advances in nanofabrication, quantum control and materials engineering.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"", ""authors"": [""David D.

letter,Spin control in reduced-dimensional chiral perovskites,"<p>Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites exhibit strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, spin-dependent optical selection rules and large Rashba splitting. These characteristics make them promising candidates for spintronic devices with photonic interfaces. Here we report that spin polarization in perovskites can be controlled through chemical design as well as by a magnetic field. We obtain both spin-polarized photon absorption and spin-polarized photoluminescence in reduced-dimensional chiral perovskites through combined strategies of chirality transfer and energy funnelling. A 3% spin-polarized photoluminescence is observed even in the absence of an applied external magnetic field owing to the different emission rates of &#963;<sup>+</sup> and &#963;<sup>&#8722;</sup> polarized photoluminescence. Three-dimensional perovskites achieve a comparable degree of photoluminescence polarization only under an external magnetic field of 5&#8201;T.

article,Large-scale silicon quantum photonics implementing arbitrary two-qubit processing,"<p>Photonics is a promising platform for implementing universal quantum information processing. Its main challenges include precise control of massive circuits of linear optical components and effective implementation of entangling operations on photons. By using large-scale silicon photonic circuits to implement an extension of the linear combination of quantum operators scheme, we realize a fully programmable two-qubit quantum processor, enabling universal two-qubit quantum information processing in optics. The quantum processor is fabricated with mature CMOS-compatible processing and comprises more than 200 photonic components. We programmed the device to implement 98 different two-qubit unitary operations (with an average quantum process fidelity of 93.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4.5%), a two-qubit quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and efficient simulation of Szegedy directed quantum walks.

article,Nano-optic endoscope for high-resolution optical coherence tomography in vivo,"<p>Acquisition of high-resolution images from within internal organs using endoscopic optical imaging has numerous clinical applications. However, difficulties associated with optical aberrations and the trade-off between transverse resolution and depth of focus significantly limit the scope of applications. Here, we integrate a metalens, with the ability to modify the phase of incident light at subwavelength level, into the design of an endoscopic optical coherence tomography catheter (termed nano-optic endoscope) to achieve near diffraction-limited imaging through negating non-chromatic aberrations. Remarkably, the tailored chromatic dispersion of the metalens in the context of spectral interferometry is utilized to maintain high-resolution imaging beyond the input field Rayleigh range, easing the trade-off between transverse resolution and depth of focus. We demonstrate endoscopic imaging in resected human lung specimens and in sheep airways in vivo. The combination of the superior resolution and higher imaging depth of focus of the nano-optic endoscope is likely to increase the clinical utility of endoscopic optical imaging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Medicine, Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hamid Pahlevaninezhad"", "",\u00a0Lida P.

article,Single upconversion nanoparticle imaging at sub-10 W cm−2 irradiance,"<p>Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising single-molecule probes given their non-blinking, photobleaching-resistant luminescence on infrared excitation. However, the weak luminescence of sub-50&#8201;nm UCNPs limits their single-particle detection to above 10&#8201;kW&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, which is impractical for live cell imaging. Here, we systematically characterize single-particle luminescence for UCNPs with various formulations over a 10<sup>6</sup> variation in incident power, down to 8&#8201;W&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. A core&#8211;shell&#8211;shell (CSS) structure (NaYF<sub>4</sub>@NaYb<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>F<sub>4</sub>:Er<sub>x</sub>@NaYF<sub>4</sub>) is shown to be significantly brighter than the commonly used NaY<sub>0.78</sub>F<sub>4</sub>:Yb<sub>0.2</sub>Er<sub>0.02</sub>.

article,Manipulation of polarizations for broadband terahertz waves emitted from laser plasma filaments,"<p>Polarization control of broadband terahertz waves is essential for applications in many areas, such as materials science, medical and biological diagnostics, near-field communications and public securities. Conventional methods for polarization control are limited to narrow bandwidth and often with low efficiency. Here, based on theoretical and experimental studies, we demonstrate that the two-colour laser scheme in gas plasma can provide effective control of elliptically polarized terahertz waves, including their ellipticity, azimuthal angle and chirality. This is achieved with a circularly polarized laser at the fundamental frequency and its linearly polarized second harmonic, a controlled phase difference between these two laser components, as well as a suitable length of the laser plasma filament. Flexible control of ellipticity and azimuthal angle is demonstrated with our theoretical model and systematic experiments.

article,Photography optics in the time dimension,"<p>Ultrafast sensors and depth cameras are key enablers for imaging through complex geometries, through scattering, and beyond the line of sight. However, despite accelerating advances in imaging electronics and imaging applications, the optics of such cameras have been inherited from conventional low-speed photography cameras. This has limited ultrafast cameras and their applications to the design constraints of conventional optics. Here, we exploit time as an extra dimension in the optical design and demonstrate that by folding large spaces in time using time-resolved cavities, one can enable new camera capabilities without losing the targeted information. We demonstrate lens tube compression by an order of magnitude, together with ultrafast multi-zoom imaging and ultrafast multispectral imaging by time-folding the optical path at different regions of the imaging optics. Considering the vast variety of designs that could emerge by time-folding conventional imaging optics, we expect this technique to have a broad impact on time-resolved imaging and depth-sensing optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Barmak Heshmat"", "",\u00a0Guy Satat"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Ramesh Raskar""]}, {""address"": ""Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Cambridge, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Matthew Tancik""]}]",False,"[""Barmak Heshmat"", ""Matthew Tancik"", ""Guy Satat"", ""Ramesh Raskar""]","Heshmat, B., Tancik, M., Satat, G. et al.
