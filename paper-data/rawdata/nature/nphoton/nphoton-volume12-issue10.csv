review article,Quantitative phase imaging in biomedicine,"<p>Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) has emerged as a valuable method for investigating cells and tissues. QPI operates on unlabelled specimens and, as such, is complementary to established fluorescence microscopy, exhibiting lower phototoxicity and no photobleaching. As the images represent quantitative maps of optical path length delays introduced by the specimen, QPI provides an objective measure of morphology and dynamics, free of variability due to contrast agents. Owing to the tremendous progress witnessed especially in the past 10&#8211;15 years, a number of technologies have become sufficiently reliable and translated to biomedical laboratories. Commercialization efforts are under way and, as a result, the QPI field is now transitioning from a technology-development-driven to an application-focused field. In this Review, we aim to provide a critical and objective overview of this dynamic research field by presenting the scientific context, main principles of operation and current biomedical applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""YongKeun Park""]}, {""address"": ""KAIST Institute for Health Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""YongKeun Park""]}, {""address"": ""Tomocube Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""YongKeun Park""]}, {""address"": ""Microvision and Microdiagnostic Group (SCI STI CHD), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Christian Depeursinge""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratory for Cellular Imaging and Energetics, Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"", ""authors"": [""Christian Depeursinge""]}, {""address"": ""Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Bioengineering, Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"", ""authors"": [""Gabriel Popescu""]}]",False,"[""YongKeun Park"", ""Christian Depeursinge"", ""Gabriel Popescu""]","Park, Y., Depeursinge, C. & Popescu, G.

letter,Three-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal in ferroelectric barium calcium titanate,"<p>The performance of many optical devices based on frequency conversion critically depends on spatial modulation of the nonlinear optical response of materials. This modulation ensures efficient energy exchange between optical waves at different frequencies via quasi-phase matching. In general, quasi-phase-matching structures, also known as nonlinear photonic crystals, offer a variety of properties and functionalities that cannot be obtained in uniform nonlinear crystals. So far, nonlinear photonic crystals have been restricted to one- or two-dimensional geometries owing to a lack of fabrication technologies capable of three-dimensional (3D) nonlinearity engineering. Here, we provide an experimental example of a 3D nonlinear photonic crystal, fabricated in ferroelectric barium calcium titanate, by applying an ultrafast light domain inversion approach. The resulting full flexibility of 3D nonlinearity modulation enables phase matching of nonlinear processes along an arbitrary direction, thereby removing constraints imposed by low-dimensional structures.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laser Physics Center, Research School of Physics and Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Tianxiang Xu"", "",\u00a0Xin Chen"", "",\u00a0Shan Liu"", "",\u00a0Yan Sheng"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wieslaw Krolikowski""]}, {""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of Crystal Materials and Institute of Crystal Materials, Shandong University, Jinan, China"", ""authors"": [""Tianxiang Xu"", "",\u00a0Haohai Yu"", "",\u00a0Huaijin Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jiyang Wang""]}, {""address"": ""Faculty of Physics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"", ""authors"": [""Krzysztof Switkowski""]}, {""address"": ""Science Program, Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"", ""authors"": [""Krzysztof Switkowski"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wieslaw Krolikowski""]}, {""address"": ""Max-Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Mainz, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Kaloian Koynov""]}]",False,"[""Tianxiang Xu"", ""Krzysztof Switkowski"", ""Xin Chen"", ""Shan Liu"", ""Kaloian Koynov"", ""Haohai Yu"", ""Huaijin Zhang"", ""Jiyang Wang"", ""Yan Sheng"", ""Wieslaw Krolikowski""]","Xu, T., Switkowski, K., Chen, X. et al.

letter,Experimental demonstration of a three-dimensional lithium niobate nonlinear photonic crystal,"<p>A nonlinear photonic crystal (NPC) possesses space-dependent second-order nonlinear coefficients, which can effectively control nonlinear optical interactions through quasi-phase matching. Lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>) crystal is one of the most popular materials from which to fabricate NPC structures because of its excellent nonlinear optical properties. One- and two-dimensional LiNbO<sub>3</sub> NPCs have been widely utilized in laser frequency conversion, spatial light modulation and nonlinear optical imaging. However, limited by traditional poling methods, the experimental realization of three-dimensional (3D) NPCs remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of nonlinear optics. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of a 3D LiNbO<sub>3</sub> NPC by using a femtosecond laser to selectively erase the nonlinear coefficients in a LiNbO<sub>3</sub> crystal. The effective conversion efficiency is comparable to that of typical quasi-phase-matching processes. Such a 3D LiNbO<sub>3</sub> NPC provides a promising platform for future nonlinear optical studies based on its unique ability to control nonlinear interacting waves in 3D configuration.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and School of Physics, and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"", ""authors"": [""Dunzhao Wei"", "",\u00a0Huijun Wang"", "",\u00a0Xiaopeng Hu"", "",\u00a0Dan Wei"", "",\u00a0Xinyuan Fang"", "",\u00a0Yong Zhang"", "",\u00a0Shining Zhu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Min Xiao""]}, {""address"": ""CAS Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and Design of Materials, Department of Precision Machinery and Precision Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"", ""authors"": [""Chaowei Wang"", "",\u00a0Dong Wu"", "",\u00a0Yanlei Hu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jiawen Li""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"", ""authors"": [""Min Xiao""]}]",False,"[""Dunzhao Wei"", ""Chaowei Wang"", ""Huijun Wang"", ""Xiaopeng Hu"", ""Dan Wei"", ""Xinyuan Fang"", ""Yong Zhang"", ""Dong Wu"", ""Yanlei Hu"", ""Jiawen Li"", ""Shining Zhu"", ""Min Xiao""]","Wei, D., Wang, C., Wang, H. et al.

article,Polarization-resolved black phosphorus/molybdenum disulfide mid-wave infrared photodiodes with high detectivity at room temperature,"<p>Infrared photodetectors are currently subject to a rapidly expanding application space, with an increasing demand for compact, sensitive and inexpensive detectors. Despite continued advancement, technological factors limit the widespread usage of such detectors, specifically, the need for cooling and the high costs associated with processing of iii&#8211;v/ii&#8211;vi semiconductors. Here, black phosphorous (bP)/MoS<sub>2</sub> heterojunction photodiodes are explored as mid-wave infrared (MWIR) detectors. Although previous studies have demonstrated photodiodes using bP, here we significantly improve the performance, showing that such devices can be competitive with conventional MWIR photodetectors. By optimizing the device structure and light management, we demonstrate a two-terminal device that achieves room-temperature external quantum efficiencies (&#951;<sub>e</sub>) of 35% and specific detectivities (D*) as high as 1.1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>10</sup>&#8201;cm&#8201;Hz<sup>1/2</sup>&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in the MWIR region.

article,Terahertz dynamics of electron–vibron coupling in single molecules with tunable electrostatic potential,"<p>Clarifying electronic and vibronic properties at the individual molecule level provides key insights for future chemistry, nanoelectronics and quantum information technologies. However, information obtained by conventional single-molecule transport measurements is based on time-averaged properties. Here, we report on terahertz (THz) spectroscopy of single fullerene molecules by using a single-molecule transistor geometry. From the time-domain THz autocorrelation measurements, we obtained THz spectra associated with the THz-induced centre-of-mass oscillation of the molecules. The observed spectra reflect the potential profile experienced by the molecule on the metal surface when the number of electrons on the molecule fluctuates by one during the single-electron tunnelling process. Such an ultra-high sensitivity to the electronic/vibronic structures of a single molecule on the addition/removal of a single electron has been achieved as a result of using THz spectroscopy in the single-molecule transistor geometry.

article,Non-reciprocal interband Brillouin modulation,"<p>Non-reciprocal light propagation is essential to control optical crosstalk and back-scatter in photonic systems. However, realizing high-fidelity non-reciprocity in low-loss integrated photonic circuits remains challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a form of non-local acousto-optic light scattering to produce non-reciprocal single-sideband modulation and mode conversion in an integrated silicon photonic platform. In this system, a travelling-wave acoustic phonon driven by optical forces in a silicon waveguide spatiotemporally modulates light in a separate waveguide through linear interband Brillouin scattering. This process extends narrowband optomechanics-based schemes for non-reciprocity to travelling-wave physics, enabling large operation bandwidths of more than 125&#8201;GHz and up to 38&#8201;dB of non-reciprocal contrast between forward- and backward-propagating optical waves. The modulator operation wavelength is tunable over a 35-nm range by varying the optical drive wavelength.

article,Coherent extreme-ultraviolet emission generated through frustrated tunnelling ionization,"<p>Coherent extreme-ultraviolet emission can be obtained through high-harmonic generation and multiphoton excitation from atoms exposed to a strong laser field. We report the generation of a new kind of coherent extreme-ultraviolet emission from He atoms excited by intense few-cycle laser pulses. An atom can be excited after tunnelling in a strong laser field, in the process known as frustrated tunnelling ionization (FTI). We find that excitation through FTI leads to coherent extreme-ultraviolet emission, and its intensity strongly depends on the ellipticity and carrier-envelope phase of the laser pulses. Additionally, the propagation direction of the emission can be coherently controlled by employing the attosecond lighthouse technique. This coherent control of tunnelling and recombination dynamics, which has provided the fundamental basis of attosecond physics, promises the utilization of FTI emission as a coherent light source and offers new opportunities in ultrafast spectroscopy.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Relativistic Laser Science, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Gwangju, Korea"", ""authors"": [""Hyeok Yun"", "",\u00a0Je Hoi Mun"", "",\u00a0Sung In Hwang"", "",\u00a0Seung Beom Park"", "",\u00a0Igor A.

article,Silicon–plasmonic integrated circuits for terahertz signal generation and coherent detection,"<p>Optoelectronic signal processing offers great potential for generation and detection of ultra-broadband waveforms in the terahertz range (so-called T-waves). However, fabrication of the underlying devices still relies on complex processes using dedicated III&#8211;V semiconductor substrates. This severely restricts the application potential of current T-wave transmitters and receivers and impedes co-integration of these devices with advanced photonic signal processing circuits. Here, we demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by plasmonic internal-photoemission detectors (PIPEDs). PIPEDs can be realized on the silicon photonic platform, which allows exploiting the enormous opportunities of the associated device portfolio. In our experiments, we demonstrate both T-wave signal generation and coherent detection at frequencies up to 1&#8201;THz.
