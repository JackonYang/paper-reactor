letter,Tri-comb spectroscopy,"<p>Multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is a powerful method that enables the measurement of homogeneous linewidths in inhomogenously broadened systems, many-body interactions and coupling between excited resonances, all of which are not simultaneously accessible by any other method. Current implementations of MDCS require a bulky apparatus and suffer from resolution and acquisition speed limitations that constrain their applications outside the laboratory. Here, we propose and demonstrate an approach to nonlinear coherent spectroscopy that utilizes three slightly different repetition-rate frequency combs. Unlike traditional nonlinear methods, tri-comb spectroscopy uses only a single photodetector and no mechanical moving elements to enable faster acquisition times, while also providing comb resolution. As a proof of concept, a multidimensional coherent spectrum with comb cross-diagonal resolution is generated using only 365&#8201;ms of data. These improvements make MDCS relevant for systems with narrow resonances and it has the potential to be field deployable for chemical-sensing applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"", ""authors"": [""Bachana Lomsadze"", "",\u00a0Brad C.

article,Anion-exchange red perovskite quantum dots with ammonium iodine salts for highly efficient light-emitting devices,"<p>Perovskite quantum dots have significant potential for light-emitting devices because of their high colour purity and colour tunability in the visible spectrum. Here, we report highly efficient red perovskite quantum dot-based light-emitting devices. The quantum dots were fabricated by anion exchange from pristine CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> using halide-anion-containing alkyl ammonium and aryl ammonium salts. Anion-exchange quantum dots based on ammonium iodine salts exhibited a strong redshift from green emission to a deep-red emission at 649&#8201;nm as well as higher photoluminescence quantum yields. Furthermore, the quantum dot-based light-emitting device with the alkyl ammonium iodine salt exhibited an external quantum efficiency of 21.3% and high colour purity, with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage coordinates of (0.72, 0.28), while the light-emitting device with the aryl ammonium iodine salt showed an external quantum efficiency of 14.1%. Finally, the operational stability of the latter was 36 times higher because the surface ligand density of the corresponding quantum dots was lower.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Graduate School of Organic Materials Science, Yamagata, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takayuki Chiba"", "",\u00a0Yukihiro Hayashi"", "",\u00a0Hinako Ebe"", "",\u00a0Keigo Hoshi"", "",\u00a0Jun Sato"", "",\u00a0Shugo Sato"", "",\u00a0Yong-Jin Pu"", "",\u00a0Satoru Ohisa"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Junji Kido""]}, {""address"": ""Research Center for Organic Materials, Yamagata, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takayuki Chiba"", "",\u00a0Satoru Ohisa"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Junji Kido""]}, {""address"": ""Frontier Center for Organic Materials, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Takayuki Chiba"", "",\u00a0Satoru Ohisa"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Junji Kido""]}]",False,"[""Takayuki Chiba"", ""Yukihiro Hayashi"", ""Hinako Ebe"", ""Keigo Hoshi"", ""Jun Sato"", ""Shugo Sato"", ""Yong-Jin Pu"", ""Satoru Ohisa"", ""Junji Kido""]","Chiba, T., Hayashi, Y., Ebe, H. et al.

article,Synchronization of coupled optical microresonators,"<p>The phenomenon of synchronization occurs universally across the natural sciences and provides critical insight into the behaviour of coupled nonlinear dynamical systems. It also offers a powerful approach to robust frequency or temporal locking in diverse applications including communications, superconductors and photonics. Here, we report the experimental synchronization of two coupled soliton mode-locked chip-based frequency combs separated over distances of 20&#8201;m. We show that such a system obeys the universal Kuramoto model for synchronization and that the cavity solitons from the microresonators can be coherently combined, which overcomes the fundamental power limit of microresonator-based combs. This study could significantly expand the applications of microresonator combs, and with its capability for massive integration it offers a chip-based photonic platform for exploring complex nonlinear systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jae K.

The advent of soliton Kerr frequency combs in compact crystalline or integrated ring optical microresonators has opened new horizons in academic research and industrial applications.

We demonstrate that an ordinary cost-effective broadband Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot laser diode at the hundreds of milliwatts level, self-injection-locked to a microresonator, can be efficiently transformed to a powerful single-frequency, ultra-narrow-linewidth light source with further transformation to a coherent soliton comb oscillator.

article,Spatial multiplexing of soliton microcombs,"<p>Dual-comb interferometry utilizes two optical frequency combs to map the optical field&#8217;s spectrum to a radio-frequency signal without using moving parts, allowing improved speed and accuracy. However, the method is compounded by the complexity and demanding stability associated with operating multiple laser frequency combs. To overcome these challenges, we demonstrate simultaneous generation of multiple frequency combs from a single optical microresonator and a single continuous-wave laser. Similar to space-division multiplexing, we generate several dissipative Kerr soliton states&#8212;circulating solitonic pulses driven by a continuous-wave laser&#8212;in different spatial (or polarization) modes of a MgF<sub>2</sub> microresonator. Up to three distinct combs are produced simultaneously, featuring excellent mutual coherence and substantial repetition rate differences, useful for fast acquisition and efficient rejection of soliton intermodulation products. Dual-comb spectroscopy with amplitude and phase retrieval, as well as optical sampling of a breathing soliton, is realized with the free-running system. Compatibility with photonic-integrated resonators could enable the deployment of dual- and triple-comb-based methods to applications where they remained impractical with current technology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IPHYS, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""E.

article,Response shaping with a silicon ring resonator via double injection,"<p>Modern systems often provide complex functionality that can be realized by tailoring together elements of simpler functionality. Multiplicity of simple optical functions (response shapes), when densely fabricated on a chip, can promote the concept of a field-programmable optical array. Shaping of the frequency response, or otherwise an electrical-to-optical response, is studied and demonstrated by means of a racetrack-shaped ring resonator designed and fabricated in the so-called double injection configuration. This configuration possesses a unique property that allows two free spectral range states (regular, 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;regular) to exist for a single ring length. Shaping is realized by properly selecting different coupling coefficients that provide a variety of interesting responses. Here, we demonstrate various shapes including: sinusoidal, triangular (linear), square (bandpass), dips and peaks (two states), spikes (tangent-like), interleaver and a so-called 20dB-min parameters-insensitive-response modulator. The transmission responses were experimentally realized, fabricated in a silicon-on-insulator platform and characterized at wavelengths around 1,550&#8201;nm.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Roei Aviram Cohen"", "",\u00a0Ofer Amrani"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shlomo Ruschin""]}]",False,"[""Roei Aviram Cohen"", ""Ofer Amrani"", ""Shlomo Ruschin""]","Cohen, R.A., Amrani, O. & Ruschin, S.
