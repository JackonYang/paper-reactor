review article,Advances in photonic quantum sensing,"<p>Quantum sensing has become a broad field. It is generally related with the idea of using quantum resources to boost the performance of a number of practical tasks, including the radar-like detection of faint objects, the readout of information from optical memories, and the optical resolution of extremely close point-like sources. Here, we first focus on the basic tools behind quantum sensing, discussing the most recent and general formulations for the problems of quantum parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. With this basic background in hand, we then review emerging applications of quantum sensing in the photonic regime both from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Besides the state of the art, we also discuss open problems and potential next steps.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Computer Science and York Centre for Quantum Technologies, University of York, York, UK"", ""authors"": [""S.

letter,Giant broadband refraction in the visible in a ferroelectric perovskite,"<p>In principle, materials with a broadband giant index of refraction (n&#8201;&gt;&#8201;10) overcome chromatic aberration and shrink the diffraction limit down to the nanoscale, allowing new opportunities for nanoscopic imaging. They also open alternative avenues for the management of light to improve the performance of photovoltaic cells.

letter,Dissipative self-organization in optical space,"<p>The complex behaviours of schools of fish and swarms of bacteria can be emulated in soft-matter systems that assemble into flocks and active nematics, respectively. These artificial structures emerge far from thermodynamic equilibrium through the process of dissipative self-organization, in which many-body interactions coordinate energy dissipation. The development of such active matter has deepened our understanding of living systems. Yet, the application of dissipative self-organization has been restricted to soft-matter systems, whose elements organize through their respective motions. Here, we demonstrate dissipative self-organization in solid-state photonics. Our structure consists of a random array of Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonators that are externally driven and interact coherently through thermo-optical feedback. At sufficient optical driving power, the system undergoes a phase transition into a robustly organized non-equilibrium state that actively partitions energy dissipation, while displaying resiliency to perturbations and collective memory. Self-organizing photonics opens possibilities for developing scalable architectures and life-like networks for brain-inspired computation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Chad Ropp"", "",\u00a0Nicolas Bachelard"", "",\u00a0David Barth"", "",\u00a0Yuan Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xiang Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""Materials Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yuan Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xiang Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"", ""authors"": [""Xiang Zhang""]}]",False,"[""Chad Ropp"", ""Nicolas Bachelard"", ""David Barth"", ""Yuan Wang"", ""Xiang Zhang""]","Ropp, C., Bachelard, N., Barth, D. et al.

letter,Thermal-motion-induced non-reciprocal quantum optical system,"<p>Magnetic-free optical non-reciprocal components, such as isolators and circulators, are highly desirable for on-chip optical signal processing and quantum networks. However, their realization presents a fundamental difficulty due to the Lorentz reciprocity in most optical devices. In this study, we propose and experimentally realize optical non-reciprocity with atoms embedded in a ring cavity at room temperature. Random thermal motion of atoms, in the presence of a unidirectional control field, creates susceptibility&#8211;momentum locking, and subsequently a new type of chiral quantum optical system. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong non-reciprocity based on this chiral quantum system in the regime of collectively strong atom&#8211;cavity coupling.

letter,Microwave plasmonic mixer in a transparent fibre–wireless link,"<p>To cope with the high bandwidth requirements of wireless applications, carrier frequencies are shifting towards the millimetre-wave and terahertz bands. Conversely, data is normally transported to remote wireless antennas by optical fibres. Therefore, full transparency and flexibility to switch between optical and wireless domains would be desirable. Here, we demonstrate a direct wireless-to-optical receiver in a transparent optical link. We successfully transmit 20 and 10 Gbit&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> over wireless distances of 1 and 5&#8201;m, respectively, at a carrier frequency of 60&#8201;GHz. Key to the breakthrough is a plasmonic mixer directly mapping the wireless information onto optical signals. The plasmonic scheme with its subwavelength feature and pronounced field confinement provides a built-in field enhancement of up to 90,000 over the incident field in an ultra-compact and complementary metal-oxide&#8211;semiconductor compatible structure.

letter,Experimental quantum fast hitting on hexagonal graphs,"<p>Quantum walks are powerful kernels in quantum computing protocols, and possess strong capabilities in speeding up various simulation and optimization tasks. One striking example is provided by quantum walkers evolving on glued trees, which demonstrate faster hitting performances than classical random walks. However, their experimental implementation is challenging, as this involves highly complex arrangements of an exponentially increasing number of nodes. Here, we propose an alternative structure with a polynomially increasing number of nodes. We successfully map such graphs on quantum photonic chips using femtosecond-laser direct writing techniques in a geometrically scalable fashion. We experimentally demonstrate quantum fast hitting by implementing two-dimensional quantum walks on graphs with up to 160 nodes and a depth of eight layers, achieving a linear relationship between the optimal hitting time and the network depth.

article,Experimental Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger entanglement beyond qubits,"<p>Quantum entanglement is important for emerging quantum technologies such as quantum computation and secure quantum networks. To boost these technologies, a race is currently ongoing to increase the number of particles in multiparticle entangled states, such as Greenberger&#8211;Horne&#8211;Zeilinger (GHZ) states. An alternative route is to increase the number of entangled quantum levels. Here, we overcome present experimental and technological challenges to create a three-particle GHZ state entangled in three levels for every particle. The resulting qutrit-entangled states are able to carry more information than entangled states of qubits. Our method, inspired by the computer algorithm Melvin, relies on a new multi-port that coherently manipulates several photons simultaneously in higher dimensions. The realization required us to develop a new high-brightness four-photon source entangled in orbital angular momentum. Our results allow qualitatively new refutations of local-realistic world views.

article,Linear frequency conversion via sudden merging of meta-atoms in time-variant metasurfaces,"<p>The energy of an electromagnetic wave is converted as the wave passes through a temporal boundary. Thus, effective temporal control of the medium is critical for frequency conversion. Here, we propose rapidly time-variant metasurfaces as a frequency-converting platform and experimentally demonstrate their efficacy at terahertz frequencies. The proposed metasurface is designed for the sudden merging of two distinct metallic meta-atoms into a single one upon ultrafast optical excitation. This sudden merging creates a spectrally designed temporal boundary on the metasurface, by which the frequency conversion can be achieved and engineered. Interestingly, the time delay between the abrupt temporal boundary and the input terahertz pulse is found to be strongly related to the phase of the converted wave as well as its amplitude. As the proposed scheme does not rely on the nonlinearity, it may be particularly advantageous for the frequency conversion of waves with weak intensities.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Kanghee Lee"", "",\u00a0Jaehyeon Son"", "",\u00a0Jagang Park"", "",\u00a0Byungsoo Kang"", "",\u00a0Wonju Jeon"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Bumki Min""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Fabian Rotermund""]}]",False,"[""Kanghee Lee"", ""Jaehyeon Son"", ""Jagang Park"", ""Byungsoo Kang"", ""Wonju Jeon"", ""Fabian Rotermund"", ""Bumki Min""]","Lee, K., Son, J., Park, J. et al.

article,Coherent storage and manipulation of broadband photons via dynamically controlled Autler–Townes splitting,"<p>Photonic quantum information technologies rely on quantum memory for long-lived storage and coherent manipulation of short pulses of non-classical light. The optical quantum memories explored over the past two decades are based on various coherent light&#8211;matter interaction schemes, but despite impressive progress, practical memories featuring efficient, broadband and long-lived operation remain elusive, due to the technical demands and inherent limitations of the established schemes. Here, we introduce a technique for high-speed quantum memory and manipulation that overcomes these obstacles. This scheme relies on dynamically controlled absorption of light via the &#8216;Autler&#8211;Townes effect&#8217;, which mediates reversible transfer between photonic coherence and the collective ground-state coherence of the storage medium. We experimentally demonstrate proof-of-concept storage and signal processing capabilities of our protocol in a laser-cooled gas of rubidium atoms, including storage of nanoseconds-long single-photon-level laser pulses for up to a microsecond. This approach opens up new avenues in quantum optics, with immediate applications on atomic and solid-state platforms.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, University of Alberta Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Erhan Saglamyurek"", "",\u00a0Taras Hrushevskyi"", "",\u00a0Anindya Rastogi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Lindsay J.

article,High-efficiency perovskite–polymer bulk heterostructure light-emitting diodes,"<p>Perovskite-based optoelectronic devices are gaining much attention owing to their remarkable performance and low processing cost, particularly for solar cells. However, for perovskite light-emitting diodes, non-radiative charge recombination has limited the electroluminescence efficiency. Here we demonstrate perovskite&#8211;polymer bulk heterostructure light-emitting diodes exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of up to 20.1% (at current densities of 0.1&#8211;1&#8201;mA&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>). The light-emitting diode emissive layer comprises quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) perovskites and an insulating polymer. Photogenerated excitations migrate from quasi-2D to lower-energy sites within 1&#8201;ps, followed by radiative bimolecular recombination in the 3D regions. From near-unity external photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and transient kinetics of the emissive layer with and without charge-transport contacts, we find non-radiative recombination pathways to be effectively eliminated, consistent with optical models giving near 100% internal quantum efficiencies. Although the device brightness and stability (T<sub>50</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;46&#8201;h in air at peak external quantum efficiency) require further improvement, our results indicate the significant potential of perovskite-based photon sources.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"", ""authors"": [""Baodan Zhao"", "",\u00a0Vincent Kim"", "",\u00a0Robin Lamboll"", "",\u00a0Ravichandran Shivanna"", "",\u00a0Florian Auras"", "",\u00a0Johannes M.
