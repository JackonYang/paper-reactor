review article,Principles and prospects for single-pixel imaging,"<p>Modern digital cameras employ silicon focal plane array (FPA) image sensors featuring millions of pixels. However, it is possible to make a camera that only needs one pixel. In these cameras a spatial light modulator, placed before or after the object to be imaged, applies a time-varying pattern and synchronized intensity measurements are made with a single-pixel detector. The principle of compressed sensing then allows an image to be generated. As the approach suits a wide a variety of detector technologies, images can be collected at wavelengths outside the reach of FPA technology or at high frame rates or in three dimensions. Promising applications include the visualization of hazardous gas leaks and 3D situation awareness for autonomous vehicles.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"", ""authors"": [""Matthew P.

letter,Symmetry-breaking-induced nonlinear optics at a microcavity surface,"<p>Second-order nonlinear optical processes lie at the heart of many applications in both classical and quantum regimes. Inversion symmetry, however, rules out the second-order nonlinear electric-dipole response in materials widely adopted in integrated photonics (for example, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Si and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). Here, we report nonlinear optics induced by symmetry breaking at the surface of an ultrahigh-Q silica microcavity under a sub-milliwatt continuous-wave pump. By dynamically coordinating the double-resonance phase matching, a second harmonic is achieved with an unprecedented conversion efficiency of 0.049%&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, 14 orders of magnitude higher than that of the non-enhancement case. In addition, the nonlinear effect from the intrinsic symmetry breaking at the surface can be identified unambiguously, with guided control of the pump polarization and the recognition of the second-harmonic mode distribution. This work not only extends the emission frequency range of silica photonic devices, but also lays the groundwork for applications in ultra-sensitive surface analysis.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""State Key Laboratory for Mesoscopic Physics and Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of China"", ""authors"": [""Xueyue Zhang"", "",\u00a0Qi-Tao Cao"", "",\u00a0Qihuang Gong"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yun-Feng Xiao""]}, {""address"": ""Department of microelectronics and nanoelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of China"", ""authors"": [""Xueyue Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yu-xi Liu""]}, {""address"": ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University, Shanxi, People\u2019s Republic of China"", ""authors"": [""Qi-Tao Cao"", "",\u00a0Qihuang Gong"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yun-Feng Xiao""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Zhuo Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Cheng-Wei Qiu""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of China"", ""authors"": [""Yu-xi Liu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA"", ""authors"": [""Lan Yang""]}]",False,"[""Xueyue Zhang"", ""Qi-Tao Cao"", ""Zhuo Wang"", ""Yu-xi Liu"", ""Cheng-Wei Qiu"", ""Lan Yang"", ""Qihuang Gong"", ""Yun-Feng Xiao""]","Zhang, X., Cao, Q., Wang, Z. et al.

letter,Searching for exoplanets using a microresonator astrocomb,"<p>Orbiting planets induce a weak radial velocity (RV) shift in the host star that provides a powerful method of planet detection. Importantly, the RV technique provides information about the exoplanet mass, which is unavailable with the complementary technique of transit photometry. However, RV detection of an Earth-like planet in the &#8216;habitable zone&#8217; requires extreme spectroscopic precision that is only possible using a laser frequency comb (LFC). Conventional LFCs require complex filtering steps to be compatible with astronomical spectrographs, but a new chip-based microresonator device, the Kerr soliton microcomb, is an ideal match for astronomical spectrograph resolution and can eliminate these filtering steps. Here, we demonstrate an atomic/molecular line-referenced soliton microcomb for calibration of astronomical spectrographs. These devices can ultimately provide LFC systems that would occupy only a few cubic centimetres, thereby greatly expanding implementation of these technologies into remote and mobile environments beyond the research lab.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""T.

letter,A microphotonic astrocomb,"<p>Earth-like planets, dark energy and variability of fundamental physical constants can be discovered by observing wavelength shifts in the optical spectra of astronomical objects. These wavelength shifts are so tiny that exquisitely accurate and precise wavelength calibration of astronomical spectrometers is required. Laser frequency combs, broadband spectra of laser lines with absolutely known optical frequencies, are uniquely suited for this purpose, provided their lines are resolved by the spectrometer. Generating such astronomical laser frequency combs (&#8216;astrocombs&#8217;) remains challenging. Here, a microphotonic astrocomb is demonstrated via temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in photonic-chip-based silicon nitride microresonators, directly providing a spurious-free spectrum of resolvable calibration lines. Sub-harmonically driven by temporally structured light, the astrocomb is stabilized to a frequency standard, resulting in absolute calibration with a precision of 25&#8201;cm&#8201;s<sup>&#8211;1</sup> (radial velocity equivalent), relevant for Earth-like planet detection and cosmological research.

We show that the frequency and phase of light can be precisely controlled by programmed microwave signals, using concepts of canonical two-level systems including Autler&#8211;Townes splitting, Stark shift, Rabi oscillation and Ramsey interference. Through such coherent control, we show on-demand optical storage and retrieval by reconfiguring the photonic molecule into a bright&#8211;dark mode pair.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a self-guided terawatt picosecond CO<sub>2</sub> laser beam forms in air a single centimetre-scale-diameter megafilament that, in comparison with a short-wavelength laser filament, has four orders of magnitude larger cross-section and guides many joules of pulse energy over multiple Rayleigh distances at a clamped intensity of ~10<sup>12</sup>&#8201;W&#8201;cm<sup>&#8211;2</sup>. We discover that this megafilament arises from the balance between self-focusing, diffraction and defocusing caused by free carriers generated via many-body Coulomb-induced ionization that effectively decrease the molecular polarizability during the long-wavelength laser pulse.

We demonstrate all-optical interferometry of two independent phase-locked attosecond light sources. This measurement enables us to directly determine the phase shift associated with electron scattering in simple quantum systems such as helium and neon, over a large energy range. Moreover, the strong-field nature of attosecond pulse generation resolves the dipole phase around the Cooper minimum in argon through a single scattering angle. This method may enable the probing of complex orbital phases in molecular systems as well as electron correlations through resonances subject to strong laser fields.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Doron Azoury"", "",\u00a0Omer Kneller"", "",\u00a0Shaked Rozen"", "",\u00a0Barry D.

article,Sub-hertz fundamental linewidth photonic integrated Brillouin laser,"<p>Spectrally pure lasers, the heart of precision high-end scientific and commercial applications, are poised to make the leap from the laboratory to integrated circuits. Translating this performance to integrated photonics will dramatically reduce cost and footprint for applications such as ultrahigh capacity fibre and data centre networks, atomic clocks and sensing. Despite the numerous applications, integrated lasers currently suffer from large linewidth. Brillouin lasers, with their unique properties, offer an intriguing solution, yet bringing their performance to integrated platforms has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a sub-hertz (~0.7&#8201;Hz) fundamental linewidth Brillouin laser in an integrated Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> waveguide platform that translates advantages of non-integrated designs to the chip scale. This silicon-foundry-compatible design supports low loss from 405 to 2,350&#8201;nm and can be integrated with other components. Single- and multiple-frequency output operation provides a versatile low phase-noise solution. We highlight this by demonstrating an optical gyroscope and a low-phase-noise photonic oscillator.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Sarat Gundavarapu"", "",\u00a0Grant M.
