review article,Integrated microwave photonics,"<p>Recent advances in photonic integration have propelled microwave photonic technologies to new heights. The ability to interface hybrid material platforms to enhance light&#8211;matter interactions has led to the development of ultra-small and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators, low-noise frequency synthesizers and chip signal processors with orders-of-magnitude enhanced spectral resolution. On the other hand, the maturity of high-volume semiconductor processing has finally enabled the complete integration of light sources, modulators and detectors in a single microwave photonic processor chip and has ushered the creation of a complex signal processor with multifunctionality and reconfigurability similar to electronic devices. Here, we review these recent advances and discuss the impact of these new frontiers for short- and long-term applications in communications and information processing. We also take a look at the future perspectives at the intersection of integrated microwave photonics and other fields including quantum and neuromorphic photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laser Physics and Nonlinear Optics Group, Faculty of Science and Technology, MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""David Marpaung""]}, {""address"": ""School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Jianping Yao""]}, {""address"": ""ITEAM Research Institute, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Jos\u00e9 Capmany""]}]",False,"[""David Marpaung"", ""Jianping Yao"", ""Jos\u00e9 Capmany""]","Marpaung, D., Yao, J. & Capmany, J.

letter,Double-blind holography of attosecond pulses,"<p>A key challenge in attosecond science is the temporal characterization of attosecond pulses that are essential for understanding the evolution of electronic wavefunctions in atoms, molecules and solids. Current characterization methods, based on nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, are limited in terms of stability and waveform complexity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a conceptually new linear and all-optical pulse characterization method, inspired by double-blind holography. Holography is realized by measuring the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectra of two unknown attosecond signals and their interference. Assuming a finite pulse duration constraint, we reconstruct the missing spectral phases and characterize the unknown signals in both isolated pulse and double pulse scenarios. This method can be implemented in a wide range of experimental realizations, enabling the study of complex electron dynamics via a single-shot and linear measurement.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"", ""authors"": [""O.

letter,Interferometry of dipole phase in high harmonics from solids,"<p>Understanding the temporal profiles of high harmonics is essential for their applications in attosecond science. Microscopically, the dipole phase plays an important role in determining the high-harmonic emission phase. In gas-phase high-harmonic generation, the tunnel-ionized electron spends much of its travel time in the continuum&#8212;far from the parent ion, where it accumulates the dipole phase. Therefore, the atomic dipole phase is largely independent of the target atom. In solid-state high-harmonic generation, since the driven electron experiences a periodic potential during the entire travel time, the dipole phase may depend on the electronic structures of source materials. Here, we employ an interferometric method to characterize high harmonics from magnesium oxide and quartz crystals. We measure material-dependent intensity-induced high-harmonic phase delays that we attribute to the intensity-induced changes in the dipole phase originating from the interband polarization. The material-dependent dipole phase can provide a robust platform for high-harmonic spectroscopy of solids.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Stanford PULSE Institute, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jian Lu"", "",\u00a0Eric F.

letter,Coherent injection locking of quantum cascade laser frequency combs,"<p>Quantum cascade laser (QCL) frequency combs are a promising candidate for chemical sensing and biomedical diagnostics. They are electrically pumped and compact, making them an ideal platform for on-chip integration. Until now, optical feedback is fatal for frequency comb generation in QCLs. This property limits the potential for integration. Here, we demonstrate coherent electrical injection locking of the repetition frequency to a stabilized radio-frequency oscillator. We prove that the injection-locked QCL spectrum can be phase-locked, resulting in the generation of a frequency comb. We show that injection locking is not only a versatile tool for all-electrical frequency stabilization, but also mitigates the fatal effect of optical feedback. A prototype self-detected dual-comb set-up consisting only of an injection-locked dual-comb chip, a lens and a mirror demonstrates the enormous potential for on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy. These results pave the way to miniaturized and all-solid-state mid-infrared spectrometers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Solid State Electronics, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Johannes Hillbrand"", "",\u00a0Aaron Maxwell Andrews"", "",\u00a0Hermann Detz"", "",\u00a0Gottfried Strasser"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Benedikt Schwarz""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Micro- and Nanostructures, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Aaron Maxwell Andrews"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gottfried Strasser""]}, {""address"": ""CEITEC, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"", ""authors"": [""Hermann Detz""]}]",False,"[""Johannes Hillbrand"", ""Aaron Maxwell Andrews"", ""Hermann Detz"", ""Gottfried Strasser"", ""Benedikt Schwarz""]","Hillbrand, J., Andrews, A.M., Detz, H. et al.

letter,Three-dimensional femtosecond laser nanolithography of crystals,"<p>So far, nanostructuring of hard optical crystals has been exclusively limited to their surface, as stress-induced crack formation and propagation render high-precision volume processes ineffective. Here, we show that the rate of nanopore chemical etching in the popular laser crystals yttrium aluminium garnet and sapphire can be enhanced by more than five orders of magnitude (from &lt;0.6&#8201;nm&#8201;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup> to ~100&#8201;&#181;m&#8201;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) by the use of direct laser writing, before etching. The process makes it possible to produce arbitrary three-dimensional nanostructures with 100&#8201;nm feature sizes inside centimetre-scale laser crystals without brittle fracture. To showcase the potential of the technique we fabricate subwavelength diffraction gratings and nanostructured optical waveguides in yttrium aluminium garnet and millimetre-long nanopores in sapphire.

article,Deterministic creation of entangled atom–light Schrödinger-cat states,"<p>Quantum physics allows for entanglement between microscopic and macroscopic objects, described by discrete and continuous variables, respectively. As in Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s famous cat gedanken experiment, a box enclosing the objects can keep the entanglement alive. For applications in quantum information processing, however, it is essential to access the objects and manipulate them with suitable quantum tools. Here we reach this goal and deterministically generate entangled light&#8211;matter states by reflecting a coherent light pulse with up to four photons on average from an optical cavity containing one atom. The quantum light propagates freely and reaches a remote receiver for quantum state tomography. We produce a plethora of quantum states and observe negative-valued Wigner functions, a characteristic sign of non-classicality.

article,Super-resolution enhancement by quantum image scanning microscopy,"<p>The principles of quantum optics have yielded a plethora of ideas to surpass the classical limitations of sensitivity and resolution in optical microscopy. While some ideas have been applied in proof-of-principle experiments, imaging a biological sample has remained challenging, mainly due to the inherently weak signal measured and the fragility of quantum states of light. In principle, however, these quantum protocols can add new information without sacrificing the classical information and can therefore enhance the capabilities of existing super-resolution techniques. Image scanning microscopy, a recent addition to the family of super-resolution methods, generates a robust resolution enhancement without reducing the signal level. Here, we introduce quantum image scanning microscopy: combining image scanning microscopy with the measurement of quantum photon correlation allows increasing the resolution of image scanning microscopy up to twofold, four times beyond the diffraction limit. We introduce the Q-ISM principle and obtain super-resolved optical images of a biological sample stained with fluorescent quantum dots using photon antibunching, a quantum effect, as a resolution-enhancing contrast mechanism.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Ron Tenne"", "",\u00a0Uri Rossman"", "",\u00a0Batel Rephael"", "",\u00a0Yonatan Israel"", "",\u00a0Yaron Silberberg"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dan Oron""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yonatan Israel""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Experimental Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"", ""authors"": [""Alexander Krupinski-Ptaszek"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Radek Lapkiewicz""]}]",False,"[""Ron Tenne"", ""Uri Rossman"", ""Batel Rephael"", ""Yonatan Israel"", ""Alexander Krupinski-Ptaszek"", ""Radek Lapkiewicz"", ""Yaron Silberberg"", ""Dan Oron""]","Tenne, R., Rossman, U., Rephael, B. et al.

Here, we uncover a form of simultaneous spin and orbital angular momentum conservation and show, theoretically and experimentally, that this phenomenon allows for unprecedented control over the divergence and polarization of extreme-ultraviolet vortex beams. High harmonics with spin and orbital angular momenta are produced, opening a novel regime of angular momentum conservation that allows for manipulation of the polarization of attosecond pulses&#8212;from linear to circular&#8212;and for the generation of circularly polarized vortices with tailored orbital angular momentum, including harmonic vortices with the same topological charge as the driving laser beam.

article,Polarization switching and electrical control of interlayer excitons in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures,"<p>The long-lived interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on transition-metal dichalcogenides, together with unique spin&#8211;valley physics, make them promising for next-generation photonic and valleytronic devices. Although the emission characteristics of interlayer excitons have been studied, efficient manipulation of their valley states, a necessary requirement for information encoding, is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate comprehensive electrical control of interlayer excitons in a MoSe<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructure. Encapsulation of our well-aligned stack with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) allows us to resolve two separate narrow interlayer transitions with opposite helicities under circularly polarized excitation, either preserving or reversing the polarization of incoming light. By electrically controlling their relative intensities, we realize a polarization switch with tunable emission intensity and wavelength. Finally, we observe large g-factors of these two transitions on application of an external magnetic field. These results are interpreted within the picture of moir&#233;-induced brightening of forbidden optical transitions. The ability to control the polarization of interlayer excitons is a step towards the manipulation of the valley degree of freedom in realistic device applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Electrical Engineering Institute, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Alberto Ciarrocchi"", "",\u00a0Dmitrii Unuchek"", "",\u00a0Ahmet Avsar"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andras Kis""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Materials Science and Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Alberto Ciarrocchi"", "",\u00a0Dmitrii Unuchek"", "",\u00a0Ahmet Avsar"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andras Kis""]}, {""address"": ""National Institute for Materials Science, 1\u20131 Namiki, Tsukuba, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kenji Watanabe"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Takashi Taniguchi""]}]",False,"[""Alberto Ciarrocchi"", ""Dmitrii Unuchek"", ""Ahmet Avsar"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Andras Kis""]","Ciarrocchi, A., Unuchek, D., Avsar, A. et al.
