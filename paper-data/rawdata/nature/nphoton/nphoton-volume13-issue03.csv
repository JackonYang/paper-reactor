review article,Frequency comb spectroscopy,"<p>A laser frequency comb is a broad spectrum composed of equidistant narrow lines. Initially invented for frequency metrology, such combs enable new approaches to spectroscopy over broad spectral bandwidths, of particular relevance to molecules. The performance of existing spectrometers &#8212; such as crossed dispersers employing, for example, virtual imaging phase array &#233;talons, or Michelson-based Fourier transform interferometers &#8212; can be dramatically enhanced with optical frequency combs. A new class of instruments, such as dual-comb spectrometers without moving parts, enables fast and accurate measurements over broad spectral ranges. The direct self-calibration of the frequency scale of the spectra within the accuracy of an atomic clock and the negligible contribution of the instrumental line-shape will enable determinations of all spectral parameters with high accuracy for stringent comparisons with theories in atomic and molecular physics. Chip-scale frequency comb spectrometers promise integrated devices for real-time sensing in analytical chemistry and biomedicine. This Review gives a summary of the developments in the emerging and rapidly advancing field of atomic and molecular broadband spectroscopy with frequency combs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics, Garching, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Nathalie Picqu\u00e9"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Theodor W.

review article,Photonic-chip-based frequency combs,"<p>Recent developments in chip-based nonlinear photonics offer the tantalizing prospect of realizing many applications that can use optical frequency comb devices that have form factors smaller than 1 cm<sup>3</sup> and that require less than 1 W of power. A key feature that enables such technology is the tight confinement of light due to the high refractive index contrast between the core and the cladding. This simultaneously produces high optical nonlinearities and allows for dispersion engineering to realize and phase match parametric nonlinear processes with laser-pointer powers across large spectral bandwidths. In this Review, we summarize the developments, applications and underlying physics of optical frequency comb generation in photonic-chip waveguides via supercontinuum generation and in microresonators via Kerr-comb generation that enable comb technology from the near-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared regime.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alexander L.

review article,Quantum optical microcombs,"<p>A key challenge for quantum science and technology is to realize large-scale, precisely controllable, practical systems for non-classical secured communications, metrology and, ultimately, meaningful quantum simulation and computation. Optical frequency combs represent a powerful approach towards this goal, as they provide a very high number of temporal and frequency modes that can result in large-scale quantum systems. The generation and control of quantum optical frequency combs will enable a unique, practical and scalable framework for quantum signal and information processing. Here, we review recent progress on the realization of energy&#8211;time entangled optical frequency combs and discuss how photonic integration and the use of fibre-optic telecommunications components can enable quantum state control with new functionalities, yielding unprecedented capability.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"", ""authors"": [""Michael Kues""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Engineering, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"", ""authors"": [""Michael Kues""]}, {""address"": ""John A.

article,Separation of valley excitons in a MoS2 monolayer using a subwavelength asymmetric groove array,"<p>Excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides are formed at K and K&#8242; points at the boundary of the Brillouin zone. They acquire a valley degree of freedom, which has been explored as an alternative information carrier, analogous to charge or spin. Two opposite valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides can be optically addressed using light with different helicity. Here, we demonstrate that valley-polarized excitons can be sorted and spatially separated at room temperature by coupling a MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer to a subwavelength asymmetric groove array. In addition to separation of valley excitons in real space, emission from valley excitons is also separated in photon momentum-space; that is, the helicity of photons determines a preferential emission direction. Our work demonstrates that metasurfaces can facilitate valley transport and establish an interface between valleytronic and photonic devices, thus addressing outstanding challenges in the field of valleytronics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Complex Quantum Systems, and Texas Materials Institutes, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Liuyang Sun"", "",\u00a0Chun-Yuan Wang"", "",\u00a0Junho Choi"", "",\u00a0Andr\u00e9 Zepeda"", "",\u00a0Chih-Kang Shih"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xiaoqin Li""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"", ""authors"": [""Chun-Yuan Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Shangjr Gwo""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alex Krasnok"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andrea Al\u00f9""]}, {""address"": ""Photonics Initiative, Advanced Science Research Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alex Krasnok"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andrea Al\u00f9""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics and Applied Optics Beijing Area Major Laboratory, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Jinwei Shi""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Juan Sebastian Gomez-Diaz""]}, {""address"": ""Research Center for Applied Sciences, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan"", ""authors"": [""Shangjr Gwo""]}, {""address"": ""Physics Program, Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Andrea Al\u00f9""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, City College of The City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Andrea Al\u00f9""]}]",False,"[""Liuyang Sun"", ""Chun-Yuan Wang"", ""Alex Krasnok"", ""Junho Choi"", ""Jinwei Shi"", ""Juan Sebastian Gomez-Diaz"", ""Andr\u00e9 Zepeda"", ""Shangjr Gwo"", ""Chih-Kang Shih"", ""Andrea Al\u00f9"", ""Xiaoqin Li""]","Sun, L., Wang, C., Krasnok, A. et al.

article,Interferometric attosecond lock-in measurement of extreme-ultraviolet circular dichroism,"<p>Probing the vectorial properties of light&#8211;matter interactions inherently requires control over the polarization state of light. The generation of extreme-ultraviolet attosecond pulses has opened new perspectives in measurements of chiral phenomena. However, limited polarization control in this regime prevents the development of advanced vectorial measurement schemes. Here, we establish an extreme-ultraviolet lock-in detection scheme, allowing the isolation and amplification of extremely weak chiral signals, by achieving dynamical polarization control. We demonstrate a time-domain approach to control and modulate the polarization state, and perform its characterization via an in situ measurement. Our approach is based on the collinear superposition of two independent, phase-locked, orthogonally polarized extreme-ultraviolet sources and the control of their relative delay with sub-cycle accuracy. We achieve lock-in detection of magnetic circular dichroism, transferring weak amplitude variations into a phase modulation. This approach holds the potential to significantly extend the scope of vectorial measurements to the attosecond and nanometre frontiers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Doron Azoury"", "",\u00a0Omer Kneller"", "",\u00a0Michael Kr\u00fcger"", "",\u00a0Barry D.

In addition to spin, photons can occupy free-space orbital angular momentum eigenstates. Visible light orbital angular momentum is used in quantum information experiments, super-resolution microscopy, optical tweezers and angular momentum transfer to atoms in optical lattices. Soft X-ray orbital angular momentum applications, slowed by the lack of suitable optics and the rarity of coherent X-ray sources, could enable the direct alteration of atomic states through orbital angular momentum exchange, and methods to study the electronic properties of quantum materials. We have made soft X-ray diffractive optics that generate single Laguerre&#8211;Gauss modes, observed carrying up to 30&#295; angular momentum per photon, or their superpositions.

letter,Entanglement of three quantum memories via interference of three single photons,"<p>Quantum memory networks as an intermediate stage in the development of a quantum internet will enable a number of significant applications. To connect and entangle remote quantum memories, it is best to use photons. In previous experiments, entanglement of two memory nodes has been achieved via photon interference. Going beyond the state of the art by entangling many quantum nodes at a distance is highly sought after. Here, we report the entanglement of three remote quantum memories via three-photon interference. We employ laser-cooled atomic ensembles and make use of a ring cavity to enhance the overall efficiency of our memory&#8211;photon entanglement. By interfering three single photons from three separate set-ups, we create entanglement of three memories and three photons. Then, by measuring the photons and applying feed-forward, we achieve heralded entanglement between the three memories. Our experiment may be employed as a building block to construct larger and complex quantum networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and Department of Modern Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"", ""authors"": [""Bo Jing"", "",\u00a0Xu-Jie Wang"", "",\u00a0Yong Yu"", "",\u00a0Peng-Fei Sun"", "",\u00a0Yan Jiang"", "",\u00a0Sheng-Jun Yang"", "",\u00a0Wen-Hao Jiang"", "",\u00a0Xi-Yu Luo"", "",\u00a0Jun Zhang"", "",\u00a0Xiao Jiang"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Hui Bao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""CAS Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"", ""authors"": [""Bo Jing"", "",\u00a0Xu-Jie Wang"", "",\u00a0Yong Yu"", "",\u00a0Peng-Fei Sun"", "",\u00a0Yan Jiang"", "",\u00a0Sheng-Jun Yang"", "",\u00a0Wen-Hao Jiang"", "",\u00a0Xi-Yu Luo"", "",\u00a0Jun Zhang"", "",\u00a0Xiao Jiang"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Hui Bao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}, {""address"": ""CAS-Alibaba Quantum Computing Laboratory, Shanghai, China"", ""authors"": [""Bo Jing"", "",\u00a0Xu-Jie Wang"", "",\u00a0Yong Yu"", "",\u00a0Peng-Fei Sun"", "",\u00a0Yan Jiang"", "",\u00a0Sheng-Jun Yang"", "",\u00a0Wen-Hao Jiang"", "",\u00a0Xi-Yu Luo"", "",\u00a0Jun Zhang"", "",\u00a0Xiao Jiang"", "",\u00a0Xiao-Hui Bao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jian-Wei Pan""]}]",False,"[""Bo Jing"", ""Xu-Jie Wang"", ""Yong Yu"", ""Peng-Fei Sun"", ""Yan Jiang"", ""Sheng-Jun Yang"", ""Wen-Hao Jiang"", ""Xi-Yu Luo"", ""Jun Zhang"", ""Xiao Jiang"", ""Xiao-Hui Bao"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Jing, B., Wang, X., Yu, Y. et al.

letter,Temporal solitons in free-space femtosecond enhancement cavities,"<p>Temporal dissipative solitons in nonlinear optical resonators are self-compressed, self-stabilizing and indefinitely circulating wave packets. Owing to these properties, they have been harnessed for the generation of ultrashort pulses and frequency combs in active and passive laser architectures, including mode-locked lasers, passive fibre resonators and microresonators. Here, we demonstrate the formation of temporal dissipative solitons in a free-space enhancement cavity with a Kerr nonlinearity and a spectrally tailored finesse. By locking a 100-MHz-repetition-rate train of 350-fs, 1,035-nm pulses to this cavity-soliton state, we generate a 37-fs sech&#178;-shaped pulse with a peak-power enhancement of 3,200, which exhibits low-frequency intensity-noise suppression. The power scalability unique to free-space cavities, the unprecedented combination of peak-power enhancement and temporal compression, and the cavity-soliton-specific noise filtering attest to the vast potential of this platform of optical solitons for applications including spatiotemporal filtering and compression of ultrashort pulses and cavity-enhanced nonlinear frequency conversion.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik, Garching, Germany"", ""authors"": [""N.
