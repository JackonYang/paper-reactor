review article,The emergence and prospects of deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diode technologies,"<p>By alloying GaN with AlN the emission of AlGaN light-emitting diodes can be tuned to cover almost the entire ultraviolet spectral range (210&#8211;400 nm), making ultraviolet light-emitting diodes perfectly suited to applications across a wide number of fields, whether biological, environmental, industrial or medical. However, technical developments notwithstanding, deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes still exhibit relatively low external quantum efficiencies because of properties intrinsic to aluminium-rich group III nitride materials. Here, we review recent progress in the development of AlGaN-based deep-ultraviolet light-emitting devices. We also describe the key obstacles to enhancing their efficiency and how to improve their performance in terms of defect density, carrier-injection efficiency, light extraction efficiency and heat dissipation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Solid State Physics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Michael Kneissl""]}, {""address"": ""Ferdinand-Braun-Institut, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr H\u00f6chstfrequenztechnik, Berlin, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Michael Kneissl""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"", ""authors"": [""Tae-Yeon Seong""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"", ""authors"": [""Jung Han""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Integrated Research of Future Electronics, and Institute of Materials and Systems for Sustainability, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Hiroshi Amano""]}]",False,"[""Michael Kneissl"", ""Tae-Yeon Seong"", ""Jung Han"", ""Hiroshi Amano""]","Kneissl, M., Seong, T., Han, J. et al.

letter,Electron–hole liquid in a van der Waals heterostructure photocell at room temperature,"<p>In semiconductors, photo-excited charge carriers exist as a gas of electrons and holes, bound electron&#8211;hole pairs (excitons), biexcitons and trions. At sufficiently high densities, the non-equilibrium system of electrons (e<sup>&#8722;</sup>) and holes (h<sup>+</sup>) may merge into an electronic liquid droplet. Here, we report on the electron&#8211;hole liquid in ultrathin MoTe<sub>2</sub> photocells revealed through multi-parameter dynamic photoresponse microscopy (MPDPM). By combining rich visualization with comprehensive analysis of very large data sets acquired through MPDPM, we find that ultrafast laser excitation at a graphene&#8211;MoTe<sub>2</sub>&#8211;graphene interface leads to the abrupt formation of ring-like spatial patterns in the photocurrent response as a function of increasing optical power at T&#8201;=&#8201;297&#8201;K. The sudden onset to these patterns, together with extreme sublinear power dependence and picosecond-scale photocurrent dynamics, provide strong evidence for the formation of a two-dimensional electron&#8211;hole liquid droplet. The electron&#8211;hole liquid, which features a macroscopic population of correlated electrons and holes, may offer a path to room-temperature optoelectronic devices that harness collective electronic phenomena.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Trevor B.

letter,Breaking crosstalk limits to dynamic holography using orthogonality of high-dimensional random vectors,"<p>Holography is the most promising route to true-to-life three-dimensional (3D) projections, but the incorporation of complex images with full depth control remains elusive. Digitally synthesized holograms, which do not require real objects to create a hologram, offer the possibility of dynamic projection of 3D video. Despite extensive efforts aimed at 3D holographic projection, however, the available methods remain limited to creating images on a few planes, over a narrow depth of field or with low resolution. Truly 3D holography also requires full depth control and dynamic projection capabilities, which are hampered by high crosstalk. The fundamental difficulty is in storing all the information necessary to depict a complex 3D image in the 2D form of a hologram without letting projections at different depths contaminate each other. Here, we solve this problem by pre-shaping the wavefronts to locally reduce Fresnel diffraction to Fourier holography, which allows the inclusion of random phase for each depth without altering the image projection at that particular depth, but eliminates crosstalk due to the near-orthogonality of large-dimensional random vectors. We demonstrate Fresnel holograms that form on-axis with full depth control without any crosstalk, producing large-volume, high-density, dynamic 3D projections with 1,000 image planes simultaneously, improving the state of the art for the number of simultaneously created planes by two orders of magnitude. Although our proof-of-principle experiments use spatial light modulators, our solution is applicable to all types of holographic media.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""UNAM \u2013 National Nanotechnology Research Center and Institute of Materials Science and Nanotechnology, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"", ""authors"": [""Ghaith Makey"", "",\u00a0Parviz Elahi"", "",\u00a0Serim Ilday"", "",\u00a0Onur Tokel"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0F. \u00d6mer Ilday""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"", ""authors"": [""Ghaith Makey"", "",\u00a0Parviz Elahi"", "",\u00a0Onur Tokel"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0F. \u00d6mer Ilday""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"", ""authors"": [""\u00d6zg\u00fcn Yavuz"", "",\u00a0Denizhan K.

letter,Super-resolution retinal imaging using optically reassigned scanning laser ophthalmoscopy,"<p>Super-resolution optical microscopy techniques have enabled the discovery and visualization of numerous phenomena in physics, chemistry and biology. However, the highest resolution super-resolution techniques depend on nonlinear fluorescence phenomena and are thus inaccessible to the myriad applications that require reflective imaging. One promising super-resolution technique is optical reassignment, which so far has only shown potential for fluorescence imaging at low speeds. Here, we present novel advances in optical reassignment to adapt it for any scanning microscopy, including reflective imaging, and enable an order of magnitude faster image acquisition than previous optical reassignment techniques. We utilized these advances to implement optically reassigned scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, an in vivo super-resolution human retinal imaging device not reliant on confocal gating. Using this instrument, we achieved high-resolution imaging of living human retinal cone photoreceptor cells (determined by minimum foveal eccentricity) without adaptive optics or chemical dilation of the eye.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"", ""authors"": [""Theodore B.

article,Dual-energy electron beams from a compact laser-driven accelerator,"<p>Ultrafast pump&#8211;probe experiments open the possibility to track fundamental material behaviour, such as changes in electronic configuration, in real time. To date, most of these experiments are performed using an electron or a high-energy photon beam that is synchronized to an infrared laser pulse. Entirely new opportunities can be explored if not only a single, but multiple synchronized, ultrashort, high-energy beams are used. However, this requires advanced radiation sources that are capable of producing dual-energy electron beams, for example. Here, we demonstrate simultaneous generation of twin-electron beams from a single compact laser wakefield accelerator. The energy of each beam can be individually adjusted over a wide range and our analysis shows that the bunch lengths and their delay inherently amount to femtoseconds. Our proof-of-concept results demonstrate an elegant way to perform multi-beam experiments in the future on a laboratory scale.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Garching, Germany"", ""authors"": [""J.

Despite long-standing efforts in design and fabrication, it has been challenging to achieve all these desired properties simultaneously. We experimentally demonstrate a 12.5&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>, 90-nm-thick graphene metamaterial with approximately 85% absorptivity of unpolarized, visible and near-infrared light covering almost the entire solar spectrum (300&#8211;2,500&#8201;nm). The metamaterial consists of alternating graphene and dielectric layers; a grating couples the light into waveguide modes to achieve broadband absorption over incident angles up to 60&#176;. The very broad spectral and angular responses of the absorber are ideal for solar thermal applications, as we illustrate by showing heating to 160&#8201;&#176;C in natural sunlight.

article,Dual-band infrared imaging using stacked colloidal quantum dot photodiodes,"<p>Infrared multispectral imaging is attracting great interest with the increasing demand for sensitive, low-cost and scalable devices that can distinguish coincident spectral information. However, the widespread use of such detectors is still limited by the high cost of epitaxial semiconductors. In contrast, the solution processability and wide spectral tunability of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have inspired various inexpensive, high-performance optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a two-terminal CQD dual-band detector, which provides a bias-switchable spectral response in two distinct bands. A vertical stack of two rectifying junctions in a back-to-back diode configuration is created by engineering a strong and spatially stable doping process. By controlling the bias polarity and magnitude, the detector can be rapidly switched between short-wave infrared and mid-wave infrared at modulation frequencies up to 100&#8201;kHz with D* above 10<sup>10</sup>&#8201;jones at cryogenic temperature.

article,Optically controlling the emission chirality of microlasers,"<p>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by helical light beams is an unbounded degree of freedom that offers a promising platform in modern photonics. So far, integrated sources of coherent light carrying OAM are based on resonators whose design imposes a single, non-tailorable chirality of the wavefront (that is, clockwise or counterclockwise vortices). Here we propose and demonstrate the realization of an integrated microlaser where the chirality of the wavefront can be optically controlled. Importantly, the scheme that we use, based on the optical breaking of time-reversal symmetry in a semiconductor microcavity, can be extended to different laser architectures, thus paving the way to the realization of a new generation of OAM microlasers with tunable chirality.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies (C2N), CNRS - Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud - Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Palaiseau, France"", ""authors"": [""N.

article,Self-stabilizing photonic levitation and propulsion of nanostructured macroscopic objects,"<p>Light is a powerful tool to manipulate matter, but existing approaches often necessitate focused, high-intensity light that limits the manipulated object&#8217;s shape, material and size. Here, we report that self-stabilizing optical manipulation of macroscopic&#8212;millimetre-, centimetre- and even metre-scale&#8212;objects could be achieved by controlling the anisotropy of light scattering along the object&#8217;s surface. In a scalable design that features silicon resonators on silica substrate, we identify nanophotonic structures that can self-stabilize when rotated and/or translated relative to the optical axis. Nanoscale control of scattering across a large area creates restoring behaviour by engineering the scattered phase, without needing to focus incident light or excessively constrain the shape, size or material composition of the object. Our findings may lead to platforms for manipulating macroscopic objects, with applications ranging from contactless wafer-scale fabrication and assembly, to trajectory control for ultra-light spacecraft and even laser-propelled light sails for space exploration.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics and Materials Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ognjen Ilic"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Harry A.
