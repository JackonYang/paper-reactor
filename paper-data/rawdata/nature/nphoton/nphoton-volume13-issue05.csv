letter,Generation of narrow-band X-ray free-electron laser via reflection self-seeding,"<p>X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are widely operated on the basis of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), where spontaneous radiation from the electron beam is amplified along the magnetic field in undulators. Despite their high intensities, SASE-XFELs have a broad spectrum due to the stochastic starting-up process. To narrow the bandwidth, self-seeding has been proposed and recently demonstrated, where the seed pulse produced by monochromatizing the SASE-XFELs from the first section of undulators using a thin crystal in transmission geometry is amplified in the remaining undulators. Here, we present an efficient self-seeding scheme using the Bragg reflection to produce a seed pulse. We applied this scheme to SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free-electron LAser (SACLA), and produced nearly Fourier-transform-limited XFEL pulses that correspond to an increase in spectral brightness by a factor of six compared with SASE-XFELs. This achievement will not only enhance the throughput of present XFEL experiments but also should open new opportunities for X-ray science.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""RIKEN SPring-8 Center, Sayo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Ichiro Inoue"", "",\u00a0Taito Osaka"", "",\u00a0Toru Hara"", "",\u00a0Takashi Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Takahiro Inagaki"", "",\u00a0Toru Fukui"", "",\u00a0Shunji Goto"", "",\u00a0Yuichi Inubushi"", "",\u00a0Hiroaki Kimura"", "",\u00a0Ryota Kinjo"", "",\u00a0Haruhiko Ohashi"", "",\u00a0Kazuaki Togawa"", "",\u00a0Kensuke Tono"", "",\u00a0Mitsuhiro Yamaga"", "",\u00a0Hitoshi Tanaka"", "",\u00a0Tetsuya Ishikawa"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Makina Yabashi""]}, {""address"": ""Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, Sayo, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Shunji Goto"", "",\u00a0Yuichi Inubushi"", "",\u00a0Hiroaki Kimura"", "",\u00a0Haruhiko Ohashi"", "",\u00a0Kensuke Tono"", "",\u00a0Mitsuhiro Yamaga"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Makina Yabashi""]}]",False,"[""Ichiro Inoue"", ""Taito Osaka"", ""Toru Hara"", ""Takashi Tanaka"", ""Takahiro Inagaki"", ""Toru Fukui"", ""Shunji Goto"", ""Yuichi Inubushi"", ""Hiroaki Kimura"", ""Ryota Kinjo"", ""Haruhiko Ohashi"", ""Kazuaki Togawa"", ""Kensuke Tono"", ""Mitsuhiro Yamaga"", ""Hitoshi Tanaka"", ""Tetsuya Ishikawa"", ""Makina Yabashi""]","Inoue, I., Osaka, T., Hara, T. et al.

letter,Spectrotemporal shaping of itinerant photons via distributed nanomechanics,"<p>Efficient phase manipulation of light is the cornerstone of many advanced photonic applications. However, the pursuit of compact, broadband and deep phase control of light has been hindered by the finite nonlinearity of the optical materials available for integrated photonics. Here, we propose a dynamically driven photonic structure for deep phase manipulation and coherent spectrotemporal control of light based on distributed nanomechanics. We experimentally demonstrate the quasi-phase-matched interaction between stationary mechanical vibration and itinerant optical fields, which is used to generate an on-chip modulated frequency comb over 1.15&#8201;THz (160 lines), corresponding to a phase modulation depth of over 21.6&#960;. In addition, an optical time-lens effect induced by mechanical vibration is realized, leading to optical pulse compression of over 70-fold to obtain a minimum pulse duration of 1.02&#8201;ps. The high efficiency and versatility make such mechanically driven dynamic photonic structures ideal for realizing complex optical control schemes, such as lossless non-reciprocity, frequency division optical communication and optical frequency comb division.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"", ""authors"": [""Linran Fan"", "",\u00a0Chang-Ling Zou"", "",\u00a0Na Zhu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hong X.

letter,Tunable plasmons in ultrathin metal films,"<p>The physics of electrons, photons and their plasmonic interactions changes greatly when one or more dimensions are reduced down to the nanometre scale. For example, graphene shows unique electrical, optical and plasmonic properties, which are tunable through gating or chemical doping. Similarly, ultrathin metal films (UTMFs) down to atomic thickness can possess new quantum optical effects, peculiar dielectric properties and predicted strong plasmons. However, truly two-dimensional plasmonics in metals has so far been elusive because of the difficulty in producing large areas of sufficiently thin continuous films. Thanks to a deposition technique that allows percolation even at 1&#8201;nm thickness, we demonstrate plasmons in few-nanometre-thick gold UTMFs, with clear evidence of new dispersion regimes and large electrical tunability. Resonance peaks at wavelengths of 1.5&#8211;5&#8201;&#956;m are shifted by hundreds of nanometres and amplitude-modulated by tens of per cent through gating using relatively low voltages. The results suggest ways to use metals in plasmonic applications, such as electro-optic modulation, biosensing and smart windows.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO\u2014Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies Fot\u00f2niques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Castelldefels (Barcelona), Spain"", ""authors"": [""Rinu Abraham Maniyara"", "",\u00a0Daniel Rodrigo"", "",\u00a0Renwen Yu"", "",\u00a0Josep Canet-Ferrer"", "",\u00a0Dhriti Sundar Ghosh"", "",\u00a0F.

article,Experimental quantum key distribution beyond the repeaterless secret key capacity,"<p>Quantum communications promise to revolutionize the way information is exchanged and protected. Unlike their classical counterpart, they are based on dim optical pulses that cannot be amplified by conventional optical repeaters. Consequently, they are heavily impaired by propagation channel losses, confining their transmission rate and range below a theoretical limit known as repeaterless secret key capacity. Overcoming this limit with today&#8217;s technology was believed to be impossible until the recent proposal of a scheme that uses phase-coherent optical signals and an auxiliary measuring station to distribute quantum information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such a scheme for the first time and over significant channel losses, in excess of 90&#8201;dB. In the high loss regime, the resulting secure key rate exceeds the repeaterless secret key capacity, a result never achieved before. This represents a major step in promoting quantum communications as a dependable resource in today&#8217;s world.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Toshiba Research Europe Ltd, Cambridge, UK"", ""authors"": [""M.

article,Light guiding by artificial gauge fields,"<p>Artificial gauge fields enable uncharged particles to behave as if affected by external fields. Generated by geometry or modulation, artificial gauge fields are instrumental in realizing topological physics in photonics, cold atoms and acoustics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate waveguiding by artificial gauge fields. We construct artificial gauge fields by using waveguide arrays with non-trivial trajectories. Tilting the arrays results in gauge fields that are different in the core and cladding, shifting their dispersion curves, thereby confining the light to the core. In a more advanced setting, we demonstrate waveguiding in a medium with the same gauge and dispersion everywhere, where the only difference between the core and the cladding is a phase shift in the dynamics of the gauge fields, which facilitates waveguiding via bound states in the continuum. Waveguiding and bound states in the continuum via artificial gauge fields relate to a plethora of systems, ranging from photonics and microwaves to cold atoms and acoustics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Physics Department and the Solid State Institute, Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Yaakov Lumer"", "",\u00a0Miguel A.

article,Transverse localization of transmission eigenchannels,"<p>Transmission eigenchannels are building blocks of coherent wave transport in diffusive media, and selective excitation of individual eigenchannels can lead to diverse transport behaviour. An essential yet poorly understood property is the transverse spatial profile of each eigenchannel, which is relevant for the associated energy density and critical for coupling light into and out of it. Here, we discover that the transmission eigenchannels of a disordered slab possess exponentially localized incident and outgoing profiles, even in the diffusive regime far from Anderson localization. Such transverse localization arises from a combination of reciprocity, local coupling of spatial modes and non-local correlations of scattered waves. Experimentally, we observe signatures of such localization even with finite illumination area. The transverse localization of high-transmission channels enhances optical energy densities inside turbid media, which will be important for light&#8211;matter interactions and imaging applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hasan Y\u0131lmaz"", "",\u00a0Chia Wei Hsu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hui Cao""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Physics, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alexey Yamilov""]}]",False,"[""Hasan Y\u0131lmaz"", ""Chia Wei Hsu"", ""Alexey Yamilov"", ""Hui Cao""]","Yılmaz, H., Hsu, C.W., Yamilov, A. et al.

article,High-performance hybrid silicon and lithium niobate Mach–Zehnder modulators for 100 Gbit s−1 and beyond,"<p>Optical modulators are at the heart of optical communication links. Ideally, they should feature low loss, low drive voltage, large bandwidth, high linearity, compact footprint and low manufacturing cost. Unfortunately, these criteria have been achieved only on separate occasions. Based on a silicon and lithium niobate hybrid integration platform, we demonstrate Mach&#8211;Zehnder modulators that simultaneously fulfil these criteria. The presented device exhibits an insertion loss of 2.5&#8201;dB, voltage&#8211;length product of 2.2&#8201;V&#8201;cm in single-drive push&#8211;pull operation, high linearity, electro-optic bandwidth of at least 70&#8201;GHz and modulation rates up to 112 Gbit&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. The high-performance modulator is realized by seamless integration of a high-contrast waveguide based on lithium niobate&#8212;a popular modulator material&#8212;with compact, low-loss silicon circuitry. The hybrid platform demonstrated here allows for the combination of &#8216;best-in-breed&#8217; active and passive components, opening up new avenues for future high-speed, energy-efficient and cost-effective optical communication networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies and School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"", ""authors"": [""Mingbo He"", "",\u00a0Mengyue Xu"", "",\u00a0Jian Jian"", "",\u00a0Shengqian Gao"", "",\u00a0Shihao Sun"", "",\u00a0Lidan Zhou"", "",\u00a0Lin Liu"", "",\u00a0Hui Chen"", "",\u00a0Siyuan Yu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xinlun Cai""]}, {""address"": ""Centre for Optical and Electromagnetic Research, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Information Materials and Technology, South China Academy of Advanced Optoelectronics, South China Normal University, Higher-Education Mega-Center, Guangzhou, China"", ""authors"": [""Yuxuan Ren"", "",\u00a0Ziliang Ruan"", "",\u00a0Yongsheng Xu"", "",\u00a0Xueqin Wen"", "",\u00a0Changjian Guo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Liu Liu""]}]",False,"[""Mingbo He"", ""Mengyue Xu"", ""Yuxuan Ren"", ""Jian Jian"", ""Ziliang Ruan"", ""Yongsheng Xu"", ""Shengqian Gao"", ""Shihao Sun"", ""Xueqin Wen"", ""Lidan Zhou"", ""Lin Liu"", ""Changjian Guo"", ""Hui Chen"", ""Siyuan Yu"", ""Liu Liu"", ""Xinlun Cai""]","He, M., Xu, M., Ren, Y. et al.
