letter,A room-temperature organic polariton transistor,"<p>Active optical elements with ever smaller footprint and lower energy consumption are central to modern photonics. The drive for miniaturization, speed and efficiency, with the concomitant volume reduction of the optically active area, has led to the development of devices that harness strong light&#8211;matter interactions. By managing the strength of light&#8211;matter coupling to exceed losses, quasiparticles, called exciton-polaritons, are formed that combine the properties of the optical fields with the electronic excitations of the active material. By making use of polaritons in inorganic semiconductor microcavities, all-optical transistor functionality was observed, albeit at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we replace inorganic semiconductors with a ladder-type polymer in an optical microcavity and realize room-temperature operation of a polariton transistor through vibron-mediated stimulated polariton relaxation. We demonstrate net gain of ~10&#8201;dB&#8201;&#956;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, sub-picosecond switching time, cascaded amplification and all-optical logic operation at ambient conditions.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation"", ""authors"": [""Anton V.

letter,Laser cavity-soliton microcombs,"<p>Microcavity-based frequency combs, or &#8216;microcombs&#8217;, have enabled many fundamental breakthroughs through the discovery of temporal cavity-solitons. These self-localized waves, described by the Lugiato&#8211;Lefever equation, are sustained by a background of radiation usually containing 95% of the total power. Simple methods for their efficient generation and control are currently being investigated to finally establish microcombs as out-of-the-lab tools. Here, we demonstrate microcomb laser cavity-solitons. Laser cavity-solitons are intrinsically background-free and have underpinned key breakthroughs in semiconductor lasers. By merging their properties with the physics of multimode systems, we provide a new paradigm for soliton generation and control in microcavities. We demonstrate 50-nm-wide bright soliton combs induced at average powers more than one order of magnitude lower than the Lugiato&#8211;Lefever soliton power threshold, measuring a mode efficiency of 75% versus the theoretical limit of 5% for bright Lugiato&#8211;Lefever solitons.

letter,Ultrasensitive hyperspectral imaging and biodetection enabled by dielectric metasurfaces,"<p>Metasurfaces based on resonant subwavelength photonic structures enable novel ways of wavefront control and light focusing, underpinning a new generation of flat-optics devices. Recently emerged all-dielectric asymmetric metasurfaces, composed of arrays of metaunits with broken in-plane inversion symmetry, exhibit high-quality resonances originating from the intriguing physics of bound states in the continuum. Here, we combine dielectric metasurfaces and hyperspectral imaging to develop an ultrasensitive label-free analytical platform for biosensing. Our technique can acquire spatially resolved spectra from millions of image pixels and use smart data-processing tools to extract high-throughput digital sensing information at the unprecedented level of less than three molecules per &#956;m<sup>2</sup>. We further show spectral data retrieval from a single image without using spectrometers, enabled by our unique sensor design, paving the way for portable diagnostic applications.

letter,Valley optomechanics in a monolayer semiconductor,"<p>Interfacing nanomechanics with photonics and charge/spin-based electronics has transformed information technology and facilitated fundamental searches for the quantum-to-classical transition. Utilizing the electron valley degree of freedom as an information carrier, valleytronics has recently emerged as a promising platform for developments in computation and communication. Thus far, explorations of valleytronics have focused on optoelectronic and magnetic means. Here, we realize valley&#8211;mechanical coupling in a resonator made of the monolayer semiconductor MoS<sub>2</sub> and transduce valley information into mechanical states. The coupling is achieved by exploiting the magnetic moment of valley carriers with a magnetic field gradient. We optically populate the valleys and observe the resulting mechanical actuation using laser interferometry. We are thus able to control the valley&#8211;mechanical interaction by adjusting the pump-laser light, the magnetic field gradient and temperature.

letter,An optical tweezer phonon laser,"<p>Phonon lasers are mechanical analogues of the ubiquitous optical laser and have been realized in a variety of contexts. However, no such demonstration exists for mesoscopic levitated optomechanical systems, which are emerging as important platforms for conducting fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and gravity, as well as for developing sensing modalities that couple mechanical motion to electron spin and charge. Inspired by the pioneering work of Arthur Ashkin on optical tweezers, we introduce a mesoscopic, frequency-tunable phonon laser based on the centre-of-mass oscillation of a silica nanosphere levitated in an optical tweezer under vacuum. Unlike previous levitated realizations, our scheme is general enough to be used on single electrons, liquid droplets or even small biological organisms. Our device thus provides a pathway for a coherent source of phonons on the mesoscale that can be applied to both fundamental problems in quantum mechanics as well as tasks of precision metrology.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Optics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Robert M.

Herein, we report the development of several organic phosphors that provide colour-tunable, ultra-long organic phosphorescence (UOP).

letter,Stimulated Raman excited fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging,"<p>Powerful optical tools have revolutionized science and technology. The prevalent fluorescence detection offers superb sensitivity down to single molecules but lacks sufficient chemical information. In contrast, Raman-based vibrational spectroscopy provides exquisite chemical specificity about molecular structure, dynamics and coupling, but is notoriously insensitive. Here, we report a hybrid technique of stimulated Raman excited fluorescence (SREF) that integrates superb detection sensitivity and fine chemical specificity. Through stimulated Raman pumping to an intermediate vibrational eigenstate, followed by an upconversion to an electronic fluorescent state, SREF encodes vibrational resonance into the excitation spectrum of fluorescence emission. By harnessing the narrow vibrational linewidth, we demonstrated multiplexed SREF imaging in cells, breaking the &#8216;colour barrier&#8217; of fluorescence. By leveraging the superb sensitivity of SREF, we achieved all-far-field single-molecule Raman spectroscopy and imaging without plasmonic enhancement, a long-sought-after goal in photonics.

article,Rational molecular passivation for high-performance perovskite light-emitting diodes,"<p>A major efficiency limit for solution-processed perovskite optoelectronic devices, for example light-emitting diodes, is trap-mediated non-radiative losses. Defect passivation using organic molecules has been identified as an attractive approach to tackle this issue. However, implementation of this approach has been hindered by a lack of deep understanding of how the molecular structures influence the effectiveness of passivation. We show that the so far largely ignored hydrogen bonds play a critical role in affecting the passivation. By weakening the hydrogen bonding between the passivating functional moieties and the organic cation featuring in the perovskite, we significantly enhance the interaction with defect sites and minimize non-radiative recombination losses. Consequently, we achieve exceptionally high-performance near-infrared perovskite light-emitting diodes with a record external quantum efficiency of 21.6%. In addition, our passivated perovskite light-emitting diodes maintain a high external quantum efficiency of 20.1% and a wall-plug efficiency of 11.0% at a high current density of 200&#8201;mA&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, making them more attractive than the most efficient organic and quantum-dot light-emitting diodes at high excitations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology (IFM), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Weidong Xu"", "",\u00a0Sai Bai"", "",\u00a0Chunxiong Bao"", "",\u00a0Zhongcheng Yuan"", "",\u00a0Zhangjun Hu"", "",\u00a0Heyong Wang"", "",\u00a0Zhibo Yan"", "",\u00a0Xianjie Liu"", "",\u00a0Xiaobo Shi"", "",\u00a0Kajsa Uvdal"", "",\u00a0Mats Fahlman"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Feng Gao""]}, {""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Flexible Electronics (KLOFE) and Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Jiangsu National Synergetic Innovation Center for Advanced Materials (SICAM), Nanjing Tech University (NanjingTech), Nanjing, China"", ""authors"": [""Weidong Xu"", "",\u00a0Yanfeng Miao"", "",\u00a0Jianpu Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wei Huang""]}, {""address"": ""Beijing Computational Science Research Center, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Qi Hu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Li-Min Liu""]}, {""address"": ""International Collaborative Laboratory of 2D Materials for Optoelectronics Science and Technology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"", ""authors"": [""Chunxiong Bao"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Wenjing Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Nano Science and Technology @Polimi, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Tetiana Borzda"", "",\u00a0Alex J.

article,Anisotropic structural dynamics of monolayer crystals revealed by femtosecond surface X-ray scattering,"<p>Ultrafast X-ray scattering is one of the primary tools to track intrinsic crystallographic evolution with atomic accuracy in real time. However, its application to study nonequilibrium structural properties at the two-dimensional limit remains a long-standing challenge due to a significant reduction of diffraction volume and complexity of data analysis. Here, we report femtosecond surface X-ray diffraction in combination with crystallographic model-refinement calculations to quantify the ultrafast structural dynamics of monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> crystals supported on a substrate. We found the absorbed optical photon energy is preferably coupled to the in-plane lattice vibrations within one picosecond whereas the out-of-plane lattice vibration amplitude remains unchanged during the first ten picoseconds. The model-assisted fitting suggests an asymmetric intralayer spacing change upon excitation. The observed nonequilibrium anisotropic structural dynamics agrees with first-principles modelling in both real and momentum space, marking the distinct structural dynamics of monolayer crystals from their bulk counterparts.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"", ""authors"": [""I-Cheng Tung"", "",\u00a0Hua Zhou"", "",\u00a0Qi Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Haidan Wen""]}, {""address"": ""Collaboratory of Advanced Computing and Simulations, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Aravind Krishnamoorthy"", "",\u00a0Rajiv K.

article,Programmable plasmonic phase modulation of free-space wavefronts at gigahertz rates,"<p>Space-variant control of optical wavefronts is important for many applications in photonics, such as the generation of structured light beams, and is achieved with spatial light modulators. Commercial devices, at present, are based on liquid-crystal and digital micromirror technologies and are typically limited to kilohertz switching speeds. To realize significantly higher operating speeds, new technologies and approaches are necessary. Here we demonstrate two-dimensional control of free-space optical fields at a wavelength of 1,550&#8201;nm at a 1&#8201;GHz modulation speed using a programmable plasmonic phase modulator based on near-field interactions between surface plasmons and materials with an electrooptic response.
