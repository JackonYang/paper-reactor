letter,Taming of random lasers,"<p>Random lasers are fascinating devices due to the absence of a conventional cavity structure and their counterintuitive lasing mechanism. However, they are also notorious for their unpredictability. Despite their many unusual properties, random lasers are unlikely to achieve the ubiquitous acceptance of conventional lasers unless the underlying lasing mechanisms that govern their operation are thoroughly understood and their exotic properties are appropriately regulated. Recent demonstrations of localized random lasers are considered a breakthrough in the field because structural disorders were engineered in a top-down manner. Nevertheless, the origin of the lasing phenomenon and the controllability of these devices have not been adequately addressed. Lately, we have experimentally proven that photonic band-tail eigenstates&#8212;manifestations of photonic Anderson localizations&#8212;are responsible for random lasing in a compositionally disordered photonic crystal platform. Herein, we demonstrate that the process of governing the band-tail states offers a unique opportunity to finally regulate random lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Myungjae Lee"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Heonsu Jeon""]}, {""address"": ""Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Myungjae Lee"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Heonsu Jeon""]}, {""address"": ""Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon-INL, UMR CNRS 5270, CNRS, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Ecully, France"", ""authors"": [""S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Callard"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Christian Seassal""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Applied Physics, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"", ""authors"": [""Heonsu Jeon""]}]",False,"[""Myungjae Lee"", ""S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Callard"", ""Christian Seassal"", ""Heonsu Jeon""]","Lee, M., Callard, S., Seassal, C. et al.

article,Computed stereo lensless X-ray imaging,"<p>Recovering the three-dimensional (3D) properties of artificial or biological systems using low X-ray doses is challenging as most techniques are based on computing hundreds of two-dimensional (2D) projections. The requirement for a low X-ray dose also prevents single-shot 3D imaging using ultrafast X-ray sources. Here we show that computed stereo vision concepts can be applied to X-rays. Stereo vision is important in the field of machine vision and robotics. We reconstruct two X-ray stereo views from coherent diffraction patterns and compute a nanoscale 3D representation of the sample from disparity maps. Similarly to brain perception, computed stereo vision algorithms use constraints. We demonstrate that phase-contrast images relax the disparity constraints, allowing occulted features to be revealed. We also show that by using nanoparticles as labels we can extend the applicability of the technique to complex samples. Computed stereo X-ray imaging will find application at X-ray free-electron lasers, synchrotrons and laser-based sources, and in industrial and medical 3D diagnosis methods.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""LIDYL, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CEA Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"", ""authors"": [""J.

article,Femtofarad optoelectronic integration demonstrating energy-saving signal conversion and nonlinear functions,"<p>The introduction of photonic technologies into mature electronic circuits is in high demand to accelerate on-chip information networking and even computing. Great difficulty lies in the fact that the optoelectronic coupling at their interfaces requires a substantial charging energy determined by their capacitance. Optoelectronic devices have been too large to reduce the integrated capacitance down to the femtofarad scale. Here we use a photonic-crystal platform to demonstrate the first experimental proof of optoelectronic integration at only 2&#8201;fF. This allows us to realize a record-low attojoule-energy electro-optic modulator (an electrical-to-optical or E&#8211;O converter) and an amplifier-free photoreceiver (an optical-to-electrical, or O&#8211;E converter), which leads to ultralow-energy signal conversion. By integrating these O&#8211;E/E&#8211;O devices, we demonstrate femtofarad &#8216;O&#8211;E&#8211;O transistors&#8217; with optical signal gain that show various optical nonlinear functions, including as all-optical switches, wavelength converters and cascadable optical repeaters with a femtojoule-per-bit energy consumption. These femtofarad-scale O&#8211;E/E&#8211;O/O&#8211;E&#8211;O devices promise tightly coupled photonic&#8211;electronic integration for new fields of energy-saving information processing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Nanophotonics Center, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kengo Nozaki"", "",\u00a0Shinji Matsuo"", "",\u00a0Takuro Fujii"", "",\u00a0Koji Takeda"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Eiichi Kuramochi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Kengo Nozaki"", "",\u00a0Akihiko Shinya"", "",\u00a0Eiichi Kuramochi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Masaya Notomi""]}, {""address"": ""NTT Device Technology Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Atsugi, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Shinji Matsuo"", "",\u00a0Takuro Fujii"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Koji Takeda""]}]",False,"[""Kengo Nozaki"", ""Shinji Matsuo"", ""Takuro Fujii"", ""Koji Takeda"", ""Akihiko Shinya"", ""Eiichi Kuramochi"", ""Masaya Notomi""]","Nozaki, K., Matsuo, S., Fujii, T. et al.

article,Surface passivation of perovskite film for efficient solar cells,"<p>In recent years, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased to reach over 20%. Finding an effective means of defect passivation is thought to be a promising route for bringing further increases in the power conversion efficiency and the open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) of perovskite solar cells. Here, we report the use of an organic halide salt phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on HC(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#8211;CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub> mixed perovskite films for surface defect passivation. We find that PEAI can form on the perovskite surface and results in higher-efficiency cells by reducing the defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination. As a result, planar perovskite solar cells with a certificated efficiency of 23.32% (quasi-steady state) are obtained. In addition, a V<sub>OC</sub> as high as 1.18&#8201;V is achieved at the absorption threshold of 1.53&#8201;eV, which is 94.4% of the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit V<sub>OC</sub> (1.25&#8201;V).</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Key Laboratory of Semiconductor Materials Science, Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Qi Jiang"", "",\u00a0Yang Zhao"", "",\u00a0Xingwang Zhang"", "",\u00a0Xiaolei Yang"", "",\u00a0Yong Chen"", "",\u00a0Zema Chu"", "",\u00a0Qiufeng Ye"", "",\u00a0Xingxing Li"", "",\u00a0Zhigang Yin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jingbi You""]}, {""address"": ""Center of Materials Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"", ""authors"": [""Qi Jiang"", "",\u00a0Yang Zhao"", "",\u00a0Xingwang Zhang"", "",\u00a0Yong Chen"", "",\u00a0Zema Chu"", "",\u00a0Qiufeng Ye"", "",\u00a0Xingxing Li"", "",\u00a0Zhigang Yin"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Jingbi You""]}]",False,"[""Qi Jiang"", ""Yang Zhao"", ""Xingwang Zhang"", ""Xiaolei Yang"", ""Yong Chen"", ""Zema Chu"", ""Qiufeng Ye"", ""Xingxing Li"", ""Zhigang Yin"", ""Jingbi You""]","Jiang, Q., Zhao, Y., Zhang, X. et al.

article,Coherent steering of nonlinear chiral valley photons with a synthetic Au–WS2 metasurface,"<p>Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) present extraordinary nonlinearities and direct bandgaps at the K and K&#8242; valleys. These valleys can be optically manipulated through, for example, plasmon&#8211;valley-exciton coupling with spin-dependent photoluminescence. However, the weak coherence between the pumping and emission makes exploring nonlinear valleytronic devices based on TMDCs challenging. Here, we show that a synthetic metasurface, which entangles the phase and spin of light, can simultaneously enhance and manipulate nonlinear valley-locked chiral emission in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) at room temperature. The second-harmonic valley photons, accessed and coherently pumped by light, with a spin-related geometric phase imparted by a gold (Au) metasurface, are separated and routed to predetermined directions in free space. In addition, the nonlinear photons with the same spin as the incident light are steered owing to the critical spin&#8211;valley-locked nonlinear selection rule of WS<sub>2</sub> in our designed metasurface. Our synthetic TMDC&#8211;metasurface interface may facilitate advanced room-temperature and free-space nonlinear, quantum and valleytronic nanodevices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Guangwei Hu"", "",\u00a0He-Xiu Xu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Cheng-Wei Qiu""]}, {""address"": ""Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics and School of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"", ""authors"": [""Xuanmiao Hong"", "",\u00a0Kai Wang"", "",\u00a0Wenchao Zhao"", "",\u00a0Weiwei Liu"", "",\u00a0Bing Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Peixiang Lu""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), Singapore, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Jing Wu""]}, {""address"": ""School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"", ""authors"": [""Shuang Zhang""]}, {""address"": ""Departamento de F\u00edsica Te\u00f3rica de la Materia Condensada and Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC), Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Francisco Garcia-Vidal""]}, {""address"": ""Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC), Donostia/San Sebastian, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Francisco Garcia-Vidal""]}, {""address"": ""Laboratory of Optical Information Technology, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, China"", ""authors"": [""Peixiang Lu""]}]",False,"[""Guangwei Hu"", ""Xuanmiao Hong"", ""Kai Wang"", ""Jing Wu"", ""He-Xiu Xu"", ""Wenchao Zhao"", ""Weiwei Liu"", ""Shuang Zhang"", ""Francisco Garcia-Vidal"", ""Bing Wang"", ""Peixiang Lu"", ""Cheng-Wei Qiu""]","Hu, G., Hong, X., Wang, K. et al.

article,Ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared optical properties of amyloid fibrils shed light on amyloidogenesis,"<p>Amyloid fibres attract considerable interest due to their biological role in neurodegenerative diseases and their potential as functional biomaterials. Here, we describe an intrinsic signal of amyloid fibres in the near-infrared range. When combined with their recently reported blue luminescence, it paves the way towards new blueprints for the label-free detection of amyloid deposits in in vitro and in vivo contexts. The blue luminescence allows for staining-free characterization of amyloid deposits in human samples. The near-infrared signal offers promising prospects for innovative diagnostic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases&#8212;to improve medical care and for the development of new therapies. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate direct detection of amyloid deposits within brains of living, aged mice with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease using non-invasive and contrast-agent-free imaging.

article,Interferometric scattering microscopy reveals microsecond nanoscopic protein motion on a live cell membrane,"<p>Many of the biological functions of a cell are dictated by the intricate motion of proteins within its membrane over a spatial range of nanometres to tens of micrometres and time intervals of microseconds to minutes. This rich parameter space is not accessible by fluorescence microscopy, but it is within reach of interferometric scattering (iSCAT) particle tracking. However, as iSCAT is sensitive even to single unlabelled proteins, it is often accompanied by a large speckle-like background, which poses a substantial challenge for its application to cellular imaging. Here, we employ a new image processing approach to overcome this difficulty and demonstrate tracking of transmembrane epidermal growth factor receptors with nanometre precision in all three dimensions at up to microsecond speeds and for durations of tens of minutes. We provide examples of nanoscale motion and confinement in ubiquitous processes such as diffusion in the plasma membrane, transport on filopodia and rotational motion during endocytosis.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Planck-Zentrum f\u00fcr Physik und Medizin, Erlangen, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Richard W.

article,Josephson vortices induced by phase twisting a polariton superfluid,"<p>Quantum fluids of light are an emerging platform for energy-efficient signal processing, ultrasensitive interferometry and quantum simulators at elevated temperatures. Here we demonstrate all-optical control of the topological excitations in a large polariton condensate realizing the bosonic analogue of a long Josephson junction and inducing the nucleation of Josephson vortices. When a phase difference is imposed at the boundaries of the condensate, two extended regions become separated by a sharp phase jump of &#960; radians and a solitonic depletion of the density, forming an insulating barrier with a suppressed order parameter. The superfluid behaviour&#8212;characterized by a smooth phase gradient across the system instead of the sharp phase jump&#8212;is recovered at higher polariton densities and is mediated by the nucleation of Josephson vortices within the barrier. Our results contribute to the understanding of dissipation and stability of elementary excitations in macroscale quantum systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CNR NANOTEC\u2014Institute of Nanotechnology, Lecce, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Davide Caputo"", "",\u00a0Dario Ballarini"", "",\u00a0Milena De Giorgi"", "",\u00a0Lorenzo Dominici"", "",\u00a0Giuseppe Gigli"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Daniele Sanvitto""]}, {""address"": ""University of Salento, Lecce, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Davide Caputo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Giuseppe Gigli""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland"", ""authors"": [""Nataliya Bobrovska"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Michal Matuszewski""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kenneth West"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Loren N.

article,Self-organized nonlinear gratings for ultrafast nanophotonics,"<p>As devices utilizing femtosecond-duration laser pulses become more commonplace, there is a need for next-generation nonlinear-photonics technologies that enable low-energy femtosecond pulses to be converted from one wavelength to another with high efficiency. However, designing nonlinear materials to operate with femtosecond pulses is challenging, because it is necessary to match both the phase velocities and group velocities of the light. Here, we show that femtosecond laser pulses can generate self-organized nonlinear gratings in nanophotonic waveguides, thereby providing a nonlinear optical device with both quasi-phase-matching and group-velocity matching for second-harmonic generation. We use nonlinear microscopy to uniquely characterize the self-organized nonlinear gratings and demonstrate that these waveguides enable simultaneous &#967;<sup>(2)</sup> and &#967;<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinear processes for laser-frequency-comb stabilization. Finally, we derive the equations that govern self-organized grating formation for femtosecond pulses and uncover the crucial role of group-velocity matching. In the future, nanophotonics with self-organized gratings could enable scalable, reconfigurable nonlinear photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Time and Frequency Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, CO, USA"", ""authors"": [""Daniel D.
