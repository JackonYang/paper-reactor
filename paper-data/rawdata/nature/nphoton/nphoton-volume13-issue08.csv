letter,THz-to-optical conversion in wireless communications using an ultra-broadband plasmonic modulator,"<p>Future wireless communication networks will need to handle data rates of tens or even hundreds of Gbit&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> per link, requiring carrier frequencies in the unallocated THz spectrum. In this context, seamless integration of THz links into existing fibre-optic infrastructures is of great importance to complement the inherent portability and flexibility advantages of wireless networks and the reliable and virtually unlimited capacity of optical transmission systems. On the technological level, this requires novel device and signal processing concepts for direct conversion of data streams between the THz and optical domains. Here, we demonstrate a THz link that is seamlessly integrated into a fibre-optic network using direct THz-to-optical (T/O) conversion at the wireless receiver. We exploit an ultra-broadband silicon-plasmonic modulator having a 3&#8201;dB bandwidth in excess of 0.36&#8201;THz for T/O conversion of a 50&#8201;Gbit&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> data stream that is transmitted on a 0.2885&#8201;THz carrier over a 16-m-long wireless link.

letter,High-sensitivity imaging of time-domain near-infrared light transducer,"<p>The optically transparent biological window in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral range allows deep-tissue excitation and the detection of fluorescence signals. Spectrum-domain discrimination of NIR contrast agents via an upconversion or downshifting scheme requires sufficient (anti-) Stokes shift to separate excitation and fluorescence emission. Here, we report a time-domain (&#964;) scheme in which about 5,000 ytterbium signal transducers are condensed within an optically inert and biocompatible CaF<sub>2</sub> shell (2.3&#8201;nm), which forms a 14.5&#8201;nm &#964;-dot. Because of the long-lived and spectrally narrowly defined excited state of pure ytterbium ions, the NIR &#964;-dot can convert the NIR pulsed excitation into long-decaying luminescence with an efficiency approaching 100%.

article,Controlling competing photochemical reactions stabilizes perovskite solar cells,"<p>Metal halide perovskites have become a popular material system for fabricating photovoltaics and various optoelectronic devices. However, long-term reliability must be assured. Instabilities are manifested as light-induced ion migration and segregation, which can lead to material degradation. Discordant reports have shown a beneficial role of ion migration under illumination, leading to defect healing. By combining ab initio simulations with photoluminescence measurements under controlled conditions, we demonstrate that photo-instabilities are related to light-induced formation and annihilation of defects acting as carrier trap states. We show that these phenomena coexist and compete. In particular, long-living carrier traps related to halide defects trigger photoinduced material transformations, driving both processes. Defect formation can be controlled by blocking under-coordinated surface sites, which act as a defect reservoir. By use of a passivation strategy we are thus able to stabilize the perovskite layer, leading to improved optoelectronic material quality and enhanced photostability in solar cells.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Nano Science and Technology @Polimi, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Milan, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Silvia G.

However, finding suitable deep-blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials is still challenging. Here, we report two highly efficient deep-blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, TDBA&#8211;Ac and TDBA&#8211;DI, containing oxygen-bridged, symmetric and rigid boron acceptor moieties. Both emitters have been designed to have high photoluminescence quantum yield and narrow-band blue emission.

article,High-energy pulse self-compression and ultraviolet generation through soliton dynamics in hollow capillary fibres,"<p>Optical soliton dynamics can cause extreme alteration of the temporal and spectral shape of a propagating light pulse. This occurs at up to kilowatt peak powers in glass-core optical fibres and at the gigawatt level in gas-filled microstructured hollow-core fibres. Here, we demonstrate optical soliton dynamics in large-core hollow capillary fibres. This enables scaling of soliton effects by several orders of magnitude to the multi-millijoule energy and terawatt peak power level. We experimentally demonstrate two key soliton effects. First, we observe self-compression to sub-cycle pulses and infer the creation of sub-femtosecond field waveforms&#8212;a route to high-power optical attosecond pulse generation. Second, we efficiently generate continuously tunable high-energy (1&#8211;16&#8201;&#956;J) pulses in the vacuum and deep ultraviolet (110&#8201;nm to 400&#8201;nm) through resonant dispersive-wave emission.

article,Coherent soft X-ray pulses from an echo-enabled harmonic generation free-electron laser,"<p>X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs), which amplify light emitted by a relativistic electron beam, are extending nonlinear optical techniques to shorter wavelengths, adding element specificity by exciting and probing electronic transitions from core levels. These techniques would benefit tremendously from having a stable FEL source, generating spectrally pure and wavelength-tunable pulses. We show that such requirements can be met by operating the FEL in the so-called echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) configuration. Here, two external conventional lasers are used to precisely tailor the longitudinal phase space of the electron beam before emission of X-rays. We demonstrate high-gain EEHG lasing producing stable, intense, nearly fully coherent pulses at wavelengths as short as 5.9&#8201;nm (~211&#8201;eV) at the FERMI FEL user facility. Low sensitivity to electron-beam imperfections and observation of stable, narrow-band, coherent emission down to 2.6&#8201;nm (~474&#8201;eV) make the technique a prime candidate for generating laser-like pulses in the X-ray spectral region, opening the door to multidimensional coherent spectroscopies at short wavelengths.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste, Area Science Park, Trieste, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Primo\u017e Rebernik Ribi\u010d"", "",\u00a0Alessandro Abrami"", "",\u00a0Laura Badano"", "",\u00a0Maurizio Bossi"", "",\u00a0Flavio Capotondi"", "",\u00a0Davide Castronovo"", "",\u00a0Marco Cautero"", "",\u00a0Paolo Cinquegrana"", "",\u00a0Ivan Cudin"", "",\u00a0Miltcho Boyanov Danailov"", "",\u00a0Giovanni De Ninno"", "",\u00a0Alexander Demidovich"", "",\u00a0Simone Di Mitri"", "",\u00a0Bruno Diviacco"", "",\u00a0William M.

article,Retrieval of phase relation and emission profile of quantum cascade laser frequency combs,"<p>Recently, the field of optical frequency combs experienced a major development of new sources. They are generally much smaller in size (on the scale of millimetres) and can extend frequency comb emission to other spectral regions, in particular towards the mid- and far-infrared regions. Unlike classical pulsed frequency combs, their mode-locking mechanism relies on four-wave-mixing nonlinear processes, yielding a non-trivial phase relation among the modes and an uncommon emission time profile. Here, by combining dual-comb multi-heterodyne detection with Fourier-transform analysis, we show how to simultaneously acquire and monitor over a wide range of timescales the phase pattern of a generic (unknown) frequency comb. The technique is applied to characterize both a mid-infrared and a terahertz quantum cascade laser frequency comb, conclusively proving the high degree of coherence and the remarkable long-term stability of these sources. Moreover, the technique allows also the reconstruction of the electric field, intensity profile and instantaneous frequency of the emission.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CNR-INO \u2013 Istituto Nazionale di Ottica, Florence, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Francesco Cappelli"", "",\u00a0Luigi Consolino"", "",\u00a0Giulio Campo"", "",\u00a0Iacopo Galli"", "",\u00a0Davide Mazzotti"", "",\u00a0Annamaria Campa"", "",\u00a0Pablo Cancio Pastor"", "",\u00a0Roberto Eramo"", "",\u00a0Paolo De Natale"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Saverio Bartalini""]}, {""address"": ""LENS \u2013 European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Francesco Cappelli"", "",\u00a0Luigi Consolino"", "",\u00a0Giulio Campo"", "",\u00a0Iacopo Galli"", "",\u00a0Davide Mazzotti"", "",\u00a0Annamaria Campa"", "",\u00a0Pablo Cancio Pastor"", "",\u00a0Roberto Eramo"", "",\u00a0Paolo De Natale"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Saverio Bartalini""]}, {""address"": ""ppqSense Srl, Campi Bisenzio, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Iacopo Galli"", "",\u00a0Davide Mazzotti"", "",\u00a0Pablo Cancio Pastor"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Saverio Bartalini""]}, {""address"": ""ASI \u2013 Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, Contrada Terlecchia, Matera, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Mario Siciliani de Cumis""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Quantum Electronics, ETH Zurich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Markus R\u00f6sch"", "",\u00a0Mattias Beck"", "",\u00a0Giacomo Scalari"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0J\u00e9r\u00f4me Faist""]}]",False,"[""Francesco Cappelli"", ""Luigi Consolino"", ""Giulio Campo"", ""Iacopo Galli"", ""Davide Mazzotti"", ""Annamaria Campa"", ""Mario Siciliani de Cumis"", ""Pablo Cancio Pastor"", ""Roberto Eramo"", ""Markus R\u00f6sch"", ""Mattias Beck"", ""Giacomo Scalari"", ""J\u00e9r\u00f4me Faist"", ""Paolo De Natale"", ""Saverio Bartalini""]","Cappelli, F., Consolino, L., Campo, G. et al.

article,Knotting fractional-order knots with the polarization state of light,"<p>The fundamental polarization singularities of monochromatic light are normally associated with invariance under coordinated rotations: symmetry operations that rotate the spatial dependence of an electromagnetic field by an angle &#952; and its polarization by a multiple &#947;&#952; of that angle. These symmetries are generated by mixed angular momenta of the form J<sub>&#947;</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;L&#8201;+&#8201;&#947;S, and they generally induce M&#246;bius-strip topologies, with the coordination parameter &#947; restricted to integer and half-integer values. In this work we construct beams of light that are invariant under coordinated rotations for arbitrary rational &#947;, by exploiting the higher internal symmetry of &#8216;bicircular&#8217; superpositions of counter-rotating circularly polarized beams at different frequencies. We show that these beams have the topology of a torus knot, which reflects the subgroup generated by the torus-knot angular momentum J<sub>&#947;</sub>, and we characterize the resulting optical polarization singularity using third- and higher-order field moment tensors, which we experimentally observe using nonlinear polarization tomography.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO - Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Av.

article,Computational time-of-flight diffuse optical tomography,"<p>Imaging through a strongly diffusive medium remains an outstanding challenge, in particular in applications in biological and medical imaging. Here, we propose a method based on a single-photon time-of-flight camera that allows, in combination with computational processing of the spatial and full temporal photon distribution data, imaging of an object embedded inside a strongly diffusive medium over more than 80 transport mean free paths. The technique is contactless and requires 1&#8201;s acquisition times, thus allowing Hz frame rate imaging. The imaging depth corresponds to several centimetres of human tissue and allows us to perform deep-body imaging as a proof of principle.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"", ""authors"": [""Ashley Lyons"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Daniele Faccio""]}, {""address"": ""School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"", ""authors"": [""Francesco Tonolini""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Photonics and Quantum Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"", ""authors"": [""Alessandro Boccolini""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Sensors, Signals and System, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"", ""authors"": [""Audrey Repetti"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Yves Wiaux""]}, {""address"": ""Institute for Micro and Nano Systems, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"", ""authors"": [""Robert Henderson""]}]",False,"[""Ashley Lyons"", ""Francesco Tonolini"", ""Alessandro Boccolini"", ""Audrey Repetti"", ""Robert Henderson"", ""Yves Wiaux"", ""Daniele Faccio""]","Lyons, A., Tonolini, F., Boccolini, A. et al.
