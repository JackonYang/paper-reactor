letter,Ultra-low-power sub-photon-voltage high-efficiency light-emitting diodes,"<p>Conventional light-emitting diodes (LEDs) face an efficiency droop at low current due to non-radiative recombination overtaking radiative recombination at low carrier density. To overcome this universal problem, we develop LEDs with high efficiency at ultralow current and voltage, using a novel quantum well design and high-quality interfaces to suppress non-radiative recombination and enhance radiative recombination. The device exhibits close to unity internal quantum efficiency at a low current density of &lt;1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>&#8201;A&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, more than three orders of magnitude lower than conventional LEDs. The LED bias voltage is reduced to ~30% below the photon voltage (h&#957;/q). Wireless communication is demonstrated at these low-power conditions, which enables new applications in smart dust and sensor networks, low-cost block chain and authentication, medical applications and wherever high efficiency at low power is needed.

article,Efficient telecom-to-visible spectral translation through ultralow power nonlinear nanophotonics,"<p>The ability to spectrally translate lightwave signals in a compact, low-power platform is at the heart of the promise of nonlinear nanophotonic technologies. For example, a device to connect the telecommunications band with visible and short near-infrared wavelengths can enable a connection between high-performance chip-integrated lasers based on scalable nanofabrication technology with atomic systems used for time and frequency metrology. Although second-order nonlinear (&#967;<sup>(2)</sup>) systems are the natural approach for bridging such large spectral gaps, here we show that third-order nonlinear (&#967;<sup>(3)</sup>) systems, despite their typically much weaker nonlinear response, can realize spectral translation with unprecedented performance. By combining resonant enhancement with nanophotonic mode engineering in a silicon nitride microring resonator, we demonstrate efficient spectral translation of a continuous-wave signal from the telecom band (~1,550&#8201;nm) to the visible band (~650&#8201;nm) through cavity-enhanced four-wave mixing. We achieve such translation over a wide spectral range &gt;250&#8201;THz with a translation efficiency of (30.1&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.8)% and using an ultralow pump power of (329&#8201;&#177;&#8201;13)&#8201;&#956;W.

article,Highly sensitive X-ray detector made of layered perovskite-like (NH4)3Bi2I9 single crystal with anisotropic response,"<p>The effective detection of X-ray radiation with low threshold is essential to many medical and industrial applications. Three-dimensional (3D) organolead trihalide and double perovskites have been shown to be suitable for direct X-ray detection. However, the sensitivity and stability of 3D perovskite X-ray detectors are limited by ion motion, and there remains a demand to develop green and stable X-ray detectors with high sensitivity and low detection limit. The emerging low-dimensional perovskites have shown promising optoelectronic properties, featuring good intrinsic stability and reduced ion migration.

article,"High-resolution, high-contrast mid-infrared imaging of fresh biological samples with ultraviolet-localized photoacoustic microscopy","<p>Mid-infrared (MIR) microscopy provides rich chemical and structural information about biological samples, without staining. Conventionally, the long MIR wavelength severely limits the lateral resolution owing to optical diffraction; moreover, the strong MIR absorption of water ubiquitous in fresh biological samples results in high background and low contrast. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that employs photoacoustic detection highly localized with a pulsed ultraviolet laser on the basis of the Gr&#252;neisen relaxation effect. For cultured cells, our method achieves water-background suppressed MIR imaging of lipids and proteins at ultraviolet resolution, at least an order of magnitude finer than the MIR diffraction limits.

article,Super-efficient temporal solitons in mutually coupled optical cavities,"<p>A coherently driven Kerr optical cavity is able to sustain dissipative temporal solitons, enabling all-optical data storage buffers and broadband frequency combs. Kerr solitons are balanced through an energy exchange with the pump field. Improving the pump-to-soliton energy conversion is of great importance for practical applications, but remains an outstanding challenge owing to a limited pump&#8211;soliton temporal overlap. Here we report the discovery of temporal solitons in mutually coupled cavities instead of a traditional single cavity. A pump recycling strategy is proposed, to greatly improve the power utilization efficiency. Using macroscale optical fibre-ring cavities, which share the same physical model as miniature microresonators, we demonstrate nearly 100% pump recycling and the ability to break the efficiency limit of a single cavity.

article,Experimental realization of a Weyl exceptional ring,"<p>Weyl points are isolated degeneracies in reciprocal space that are monopoles of the Berry curvature. This topological charge makes them inherently robust to Hermitian perturbations of the system. However, non-Hermitian effects, usually inaccessible in condensed-matter systems, are an important feature of photonic systems, and when added to an otherwise Hermitian Weyl material have been predicted to spread the Berry charge of the Weyl point out onto a ring of exceptional points, creating a Weyl exceptional ring and fundamentally altering its properties. Here, we observe the implications of the Weyl exceptional ring using real-space measurements of an evanescently coupled bipartite optical waveguide array by probing its effects on the Fermi arc surface states and bulk diffraction properties of the two constituent sublattices in an experimental realization of a distributed Berry charge in a topological material.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Alexander Cerjan"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mikael C.

article,Tunable and free-form planar optics,"<p>The advent of spatial control over the phase and amplitude of light waves has profoundly transformed photonics, enabling major advances in fields from imaging and information technology to biomedical optics. Here we propose a method of deterministic phase-front shaping using a planar thermo-optical module and designed microheaters to locally shape the refractive index distribution. When combined with a genetic algorithm optimization, this SmartLens can produce free-form optical wavefront modifications. Individually, or in arrays, it can generate complex functions based on either pure or combined Zernike polynomials, including lenses or aberration correctors of electrically tunable magnitude. This simple and compact concept complements the existing optical shaping toolbox by offering low-chromatic-aberration, polarization-insensitive and transmission-mode components that can readily be integrated into existing optical systems.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""ICFO \u2013 Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Pascal Berto"", "",\u00a0Laurent Philippet"", "",\u00a0Johann Osmond"", "",\u00a0Adeel Afridi"", "",\u00a0Marc Montagut Marques"", "",\u00a0Bernat Molero Agudo"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Romain Quidant""]}, {""address"": ""Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Paris, France"", ""authors"": [""Pascal Berto"", "",\u00a0Chang Fran\u00e7ois Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gilles Tessier""]}, {""address"": ""Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, CNRS UMR7210, INSERM UMRS968, Institut de la Vision, Paris, France"", ""authors"": [""Pascal Berto"", "",\u00a0Chang Fran\u00e7ois Liu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gilles Tessier""]}, {""address"": ""ICREA \u2013 Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats, Barcelona, Spain"", ""authors"": [""Romain Quidant""]}]",False,"[""Pascal Berto"", ""Laurent Philippet"", ""Johann Osmond"", ""Chang Fran\u00e7ois Liu"", ""Adeel Afridi"", ""Marc Montagut Marques"", ""Bernat Molero Agudo"", ""Gilles Tessier"", ""Romain Quidant""]","Berto, P., Philippet, L., Osmond, J. et al.
