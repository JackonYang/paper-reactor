review article,Brillouin integrated photonics,"<p>A recent renaissance in Brillouin scattering research has been driven by the increasing maturity of photonic integration platforms and nanophotonics. The result is a new breed of chip-based devices that exploit acousto-optic interactions to create lasers, amplifiers, filters, delay lines and isolators. Here, we provide a detailed overview of Brillouin scattering in integrated waveguides and resonators, covering key concepts such as the stimulation of the Brillouin process, in which the optical field itself induces acoustic vibrations, the importance of acoustic confinement, methods for calculating and measuring Brillouin gain, and the diversity of materials platforms and geometries. Our Review emphasizes emerging applications in microwave photonics, signal processing and sensing, and concludes with a perspective for future directions.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""University of Sydney Nano Institute (Sydney Nano), Institute of Photonics and Optical Science (IPOS), School of Physics, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Benjamin J.

letter,Narrowband deep-blue organic light-emitting diode featuring an organoboron-based emitter,"<p>Luminescent materials that exhibit narrowband emission are vital for full-colour displays. Here, we report a thermally activated delayed-fluorescence material that exhibits ultrapure blue emission with full-width at half-maximum of just 14&#8201;nm.

letter,Extremely low excess noise and high sensitivity AlAs0.56Sb0.44 avalanche photodiodes,"<p>Fast, sensitive avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are required for applications such as high-speed data communications and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems. Unfortunately, the InP and InAlAs used as the gain material in these APDs have similar electron and hole impact ionization coefficients (&#945; and &#946;, respectively) at high electric fields, giving rise to relatively high excess noise and limiting their sensitivity and gain bandwidth product. Here, we report extremely low excess noise in an AlAs<sub>0.56</sub>Sb<sub>0.44</sub> lattice matched to InP.

letter,Photonic quadrupole topological phases,"<p>The topological phases of matter are characterized using the Berry phase, a geometrical phase associated with the energy-momentum band structure. The quantization of the Berry phase and the associated wavefunction polarization manifest as remarkably robust physical observables, such as quantized Hall conductivity and disorder-insensitive photonic transport. Recently, a novel class of topological phases, called higher-order topological phases, were proposed by generalizing the fundamental relationship between the Berry phase and quantized polarization, from dipole to multipole moments. Here, we demonstrate photonic realization of the quantized quadrupole topological phase, using silicon photonics. In our two-dimensional second-order topological phase, we show that the quantization of the bulk quadrupole moment manifests as topologically robust zero-dimensional corner states. We contrast these topological states against topologically trivial corner states in a system without bulk quadrupole moment, where we observe no robustness. Our photonic platform could enable the development of robust on-chip classical and quantum optical devices with higher-order topological protection.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Joint Quantum Institute, NIST/University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"", ""authors"": [""Sunil Mittal"", "",\u00a0Venkata Vikram Orre"", "",\u00a0Guanyu Zhu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mohammad Hafezi""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and IREAP, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"", ""authors"": [""Sunil Mittal"", "",\u00a0Venkata Vikram Orre"", "",\u00a0Guanyu Zhu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mohammad Hafezi""]}, {""address"": ""ITMO University, St Petersburg, Russia"", ""authors"": [""Maxim A.

letter,Corner states of light in photonic waveguides,"<p>The recently established paradigm of higher-order topological states of matter has shown that not only edge and surface states but also states localized to corners, can have robust and exotic properties. Here we report on the experimental realization of novel corner states made out of visible light in three-dimensional photonic structures inscribed in glass samples using femtosecond laser technology. By creating and analysing waveguide arrays, which form two-dimensional breathing kagome lattices in various sample geometries, we establish this as a platform for corner states exhibiting a remarkable degree of flexibility and control. In each sample geometry we measure eigenmodes that are localized at the corners in a finite frequency range, in complete analogy with a theoretical model of the breathing kagome. Here, measurements reveal that light can be &#8216;fractionalized,&#8217; corresponding to simultaneous localization to each corner of a triangular sample, even in the presence of defects.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Stockholm University, AlbaNova University Center, Stockholm, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Ashraf El Hassan"", "",\u00a0Flore K.

article,Octave-spanning tunable parametric oscillation in crystalline Kerr microresonators,"<p>Parametric nonlinear optical processes allow for the generation of new wavelengths of coherent electromagnetic radiation. Their ability to create radiation that is widely tunable in wavelength is particularly appealing, with applications ranging from spectroscopy to quantum information processing. Unfortunately, existing tunable parametric sources are marred by deficiencies that obstruct their widespread adoption. Here, we show that ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonators made of magnesium fluoride can overcome these limitations, enabling compact and power-efficient devices capable of generating clean and widely tunable sidebands. We consider several different resonators with carefully engineered dispersion profiles, achieving hundreds of nanometres of sideband tunability in each device. In addition to direct observations of discrete tunability over an optical octave from 1,083&#8201;nm to 2,670&#8201;nm, we record signatures of mid-infrared sidebands at almost 4,000&#8201;nm.

article,Lightwave-driven gapless superconductivity and forbidden quantum beats by terahertz symmetry breaking,"<p>Light-induced supercurrents chart a path forward for the electromagnetic design of emergent materials phases and collective modes for quantum engineering applications. However, controlled spatial&#8211;temporal modulation of the complex order parameter characterizing such non-equilibrium macroscopic quantum states remains elusive. Such ultrafast phase-amplitude modulation can manifest via high harmonic modes beyond those allowed by equilibrium symmetries. Here, we drive moving condensate states via subcycle dynamical symmetry breaking achieved with nonlinear oscillating terahertz photocurrents. These non-equilibrium macroscopic quantum states with broken inversion symmetry are controlled via Cooper pair acceleration by asymmetric and multi-cycle terahertz photoexcitations. The observed supercurrent-carrying states evolve during a lightwave cycle and exhibit three distinguishing features: Anderson pseudo-spin precessions forbidden by equilibrium symmetry, strong high harmonic coherent oscillations assisted by pairing and long-lived gapless superfluidity with minimal condensate quench. Lightwave tuning of persistent photocurrents can be extended for quantum control of unconventional superconductors and topological matter, with implications on quantum gate and sensing functionalities.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University and Ames Laboratory \u2013 USDOE, Ames, IA, USA"", ""authors"": [""X.

article,Demonstration of 4.8 × 10−17 stability at 1 s for two independent optical clocks,"<p>Optical atomic clocks require local oscillators with exceptional optical coherence owing to the challenge of performing spectroscopy on their ultranarrow-linewidth clock transitions. Advances in laser stabilization have thus enabled rapid progress in clock precision. A new class of ultrastable lasers based on cryogenic silicon reference cavities has recently demonstrated the longest optical coherence times to date. Here we utilize such a local oscillator with two strontium (Sr) optical lattice clocks to achieve an advance in clock stability. Through an anti-synchronous comparison, the fractional instability of both clocks is assessed to be \(4.8 \times 10^{ - 17}/\sqrt \tau\) for an averaging time &#964; (in seconds). Synchronous interrogation enables each clock to average at a rate of \(3.5 \times 10^{ - 17}/\sqrt \tau\), dominated by quantum projection noise, and reach an instability of 6.6&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;19</sup> over an hour-long measurement.

article,Wavelength-encoded laser particles for massively multiplexed cell tagging,"<p>Large-scale single-cell analyses have become increasingly important given the role of cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems. However, no techniques at present enable optical imaging of uniquely tagged individual cells. Fluorescence-based approaches can distinguish only a small number of distinct cells or cell groups at a time because of spectral crosstalk between conventional fluorophores. Here we investigate large-scale cell tracking using intracellular laser particles as imaging probes that emit coherent laser light with a characteristic wavelength. Made of silica-coated semiconductor microcavities, these laser particles have single-mode emission over a broad range from 1,170&#8201;nm to 1,580&#8201;nm with sub-nanometre linewidths, enabling massive spectral multiplexing. We explore the stability and biocompatibility of these probes in vitro and their utility for wavelength-multiplexed cell tagging and imaging. We demonstrate real-time tracking of thousands of individual cells in a three-dimensional tumour model over several days, showing different behavioural phenotypes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Nicola Martino"", "",\u00a0Sheldon J.
