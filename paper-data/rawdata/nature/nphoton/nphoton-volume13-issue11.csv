review article,Front-induced transitions,"<p>Refractive index fronts propagating in waveguides are special spatiotemporal perturbations. The interaction of light with such fronts can be described in terms of an indirect transition where the frequency and wavenumber of a guided mode both are changed. In recent years, front-induced transitions have been used in dispersion-engineered waveguides for frequency conversion, optical delays, and bandwidth and pulse duration manipulation. These concepts have originated from different research areas of photonics, such as nonlinear fibre optics, slow-light waveguides, plasma physics, moving media and relativistic effects. Here, we discuss these concepts, providing a unifying theoretical description and highlight the potential of this exciting research field for light manipulation in guided optics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Optical and Electronic Materials, Hamburg University of Technology, Hamburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Mahmoud A.

letter,Graphene photonic crystal fibre with strong and tunable light–matter interaction,"<p>The integration of photonic crystal fibre (PCF) with various functional materials has greatly expanded the application regimes of optical fibre. The emergence of graphene (Gr) has stimulated new opportunities when combined with PCF, allowing for electrical tunability, a broadband optical response and all-fibre integration ability. However, previous demonstrations have typically been limited to micrometre-sized samples, far behind the requirements of real applications at the metre-scale level. Here, we demonstrate a new hybrid material, Gr&#8211;PCF, with length up to half a metre, produced using a chemical vapour deposition method. The Gr&#8211;PCF shows a strong light&#8211;matter interaction with ~8&#8201;dB&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> attenuation. In addition, the Gr&#8211;PCF-based electro-optic modulator demonstrates a broadband response (1,150&#8211;1,600&#8201;nm) and large modulation depth (~20&#8201;dB&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 1,550&#8201;nm) under a low gate voltage of ~2&#8201;V.

However, the performance of blue perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) is far inferior to that of their near-infrared, red and green counterparts, strongly limiting the practicality of the PeLED technology. Here, we demonstrate blue PeLEDs emitting at 483&#8201;nm with colour coordinates of (0.094, 0.184) and operating with a peak external quantum efficiency of up to 9.5% at a luminance of 54&#8201;cd m<sup>&#8211;2</sup>. The devices have a T<sub>50</sub> lifetime of 250&#8201;s for an initial brightness of 100&#8201;cd m<sup>&#8211;2</sup>.

article,Efficient and stable single-layer organic light-emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence,"<p>From a design, optimization and fabrication perspective, an organic light-emitting diode consisting of only one single layer of a neat semiconductor would be highly attractive. Here, we demonstrate an efficient and stable organic light-emitting diode based on a single layer of a neat thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter. By employing ohmic electron and hole contacts, charge injection is efficient and the absence of heterojunctions results in an exceptionally low operating voltage of 2.9&#8201;V at a luminance of 10,000&#8201;cd&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. Balanced electron and hole transport results in a maximum external quantum efficiency of 19% at 500&#8201;cd&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and a broadened emission zone, which greatly improves the operational stability, allowing a lifetime to 50% of the initial luminance of 1,880&#8201;h for an initial luminance of 1,000&#8201;cd&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>.

article,Towards optimal single-photon sources from polarized microcavities,"<p>An optimal single-photon source should deterministically deliver one, and only one, photon at a time, with no trade-off between the source&#8217;s efficiency and the photon indistinguishability. However, all reported solid-state sources of indistinguishable single photons had to rely on polarization filtering, which reduced the efficiency by 50%, fundamentally limiting the scaling of photonic quantum technologies. Here, we overcome this long-standing challenge by coherently driving quantum dots deterministically coupled to polarization-selective Purcell microcavities. We present two examples: narrowband, elliptical micropillars and broadband, elliptical Bragg gratings. A polarization-orthogonal excitation&#8211;collection scheme is designed to minimize the polarization filtering loss under resonant excitation. We demonstrate a polarized single-photon efficiency of 0.60&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.02 (0.56&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.02), a single-photon purity of 0.975&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.005 (0.991&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.003) and an indistinguishability of 0.975&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.006 (0.951&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.005) for the micropillar (Bragg grating) device.

article,Thermodynamic theory of highly multimoded nonlinear optical systems,"<p>Lately, there has been a resurgence of interest in nonlinear multimode optical systems. The sheer complexity emerging from the presence of a multitude of nonlinearly interacting modes has led not only to new opportunities in observing a host of novel optical effects but also to new theoretical challenges in understanding their collective dynamics. Here, we present a consistent thermodynamical framework capable of describing in a universal fashion the exceedingly intricate behaviour of such photonic configurations. In this respect, we derive new equations of state and show that both the &#8216;internal energy&#8217; and optical power always flow in accord to the second law of thermodynamics. The laws governing isentropic processes are derived and the prospect for realizing Carnot-like cycles is presented. In addition to shedding light on fundamental issues, our work may pave the way towards a new generation of high-power multimode optical structures and could have ramifications in other disciplines, such as Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates and optomechanics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CREOL, The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"", ""authors"": [""Fan O.

This is because of the efficient Auger scattering of Landau-quantized electrons, an intrinsic non-radiative recombination channel that eventually gains over cyclotron emission in all materials studied so far (conventional semiconductors with parabolic bands, but also in graphene with massless electrons). Auger processes are favoured in these systems because the Landau levels (or their subsets) are equally spaced in energy. Here, we show that this scheme does not apply to massless Kane electrons in gapless HgCdTe, where undesirable Auger scattering is strongly suppressed and sizeable cyclotron emission is observed. The gapless HgCdTe thus appears as a material of choice for future Landau level lasers.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Charles Coulomb, CNRS & University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"", ""authors"": [""D.

article,Wavefront shaping in complex media with a 350 kHz modulator via a 1D-to-2D transform,"<p>Controlling the propagation and interaction of light in complex media has sparked major interest in the past few years. Unfortunately, spatial light modulation devices suffer from limited speed, which precludes real-time applications such as imaging in live tissue. To address this critical problem, we introduce a phase-control technique to characterize complex media based on the use of fast one-dimensional (1D) spatial light modulators and a 1D-to-2D transformation performed by the same medium being analysed. We implement the concept using a microelectromechanical grating light valve with 1,088 degrees of freedom, modulated at 350&#8201;kHz, enabling unprecedented high-speed wavefront measurements. We continuously measure the transmission matrix, calculate the optimal wavefront and project a focus through various dynamic scattering samples in real time, all within 2.4&#8201;ms per cycle. These results improve the previously achieved wavefront shaping modulation speed by more than an order of magnitude and open new opportunities for optical processing using 1D-to-2D transformations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder, CO, USA"", ""authors"": [""Omer Tzang"", "",\u00a0Eyal Niv"", "",\u00a0Sakshi Singh"", "",\u00a0Simon Labouesse"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Rafael Piestun""]}, {""address"": ""Silicon Light Machines, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Greg Myatt""]}]",False,"[""Omer Tzang"", ""Eyal Niv"", ""Sakshi Singh"", ""Simon Labouesse"", ""Greg Myatt"", ""Rafael Piestun""]","Tzang, O., Niv, E., Singh, S. et al.

article,Optical coherence refraction tomography,"<p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a cross-sectional, micrometre-scale imaging modality with widespread clinical application. Typical OCT systems sacrifice lateral resolution to achieve long depths of focus for bulk tissue imaging, and therefore tend to have better axial than lateral resolution. Such anisotropic resolution can obscure fine ultrastructural features. Furthermore, conventional OCT suffers from refraction-induced image distortions. Here, we introduce optical coherence refraction tomography (OCRT), which extends the superior axial resolution to the lateral dimension, synthesizing undistorted cross-sectional image reconstructions from multiple conventional images acquired with angular diversity. In correcting refraction-induced distortions to register the OCT images, OCRT also achieves spatially resolved refractive index imaging. We demonstrate greater than threefold improvement in lateral resolution as well as speckle reduction in imaging the tissue ultrastructure, consistent with histology. With further optimization in optical designs to incorporate angular diversity into clinical instruments, OCRT could be widely applied as an enhancement over conventional OCT.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"", ""authors"": [""Kevin C.

article,Generation of non-classical light in a photon-number superposition,"<p>Generating light in a pure quantum state is essential for advancing optical quantum technologies. However, controlling its photon number remains elusive. Optical fields with zero and one photon can be produced by single atoms, but, so far, this has been limited to generating incoherent mixtures or coherent superpositions with a very small one-photon term. Here, we report the on-demand generation of quantum superpositions of zero, one and two photons via coherent control of an artificial atom. Driving the system up to full atomic inversion leads to quantum superpositions of vacuum and one photon, with their relative populations controlled by the driving laser intensity. A stronger driving of the system, with 2&#960; pulses, results in a coherent superposition of vacuum, one and two photons, with the two-photon term exceeding the one-photon component, a state allowing phase super-resolving interferometry. Our results open new paths for optical quantum technologies with access to the photon-number degree of freedom.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""CNRS Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Palaiseau, France"", ""authors"": [""J.

article,Video-rate imaging of biological dynamics at centimetre scale and micrometre resolution,"<p>Large-scale imaging of biological dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution is indispensable to system biology studies. However, conventional microscopes have an inherent compromise between the achievable field of view and spatial resolution due to the space&#8211;bandwidth product theorem. In addition, a further challenge is the ability to handle the enormous amount of data generated by a large-scale imaging platform. Here, we break these bottlenecks by proposing the use of a flat&#8211;curved&#8211;flat imaging strategy, in which the sample plane is magnified onto a large spherical image surface and then seamlessly conjugated to multiple planar sensors. Our real-time, ultra-large-scale, high-resolution (RUSH) imaging platform operates with a 10&#8201;&#215;&#8201;12&#8201;mm<sup>2</sup> field of view, a uniform resolution of ~1.20&#8201;&#956;m after deconvolution and a data throughput of 5.1&#8201;gigapixels per second.
