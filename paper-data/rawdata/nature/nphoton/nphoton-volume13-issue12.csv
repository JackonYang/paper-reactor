review article,Future and challenges for hybrid upconversion nanosystems,"<p>To improve the efficiency of photon upconversion, a hybrid approach of combining organic dyes and inorganic nanoparticles is proving successful, especially in the form of dye-sensitized lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles, nanoparticle-sensitized molecular triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation systems and metal&#8211;organic-framework nanoparticles. In this Review, we survey the latest advances and examine the key factors affecting upconversion performance, such as spectral overlap, core&#8211;shell design and the management of triplet excitons and quenchers at the interface between materials. Although issues such as stability, triplet-state quenching, concentration quenching and reabsorption must still be overcome, smart designs of hybrid nanosystems offer exciting opportunities for applications such as solar photovoltaic devices, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, optogenetics and nanomedicine among others.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Biomedical Materials and Devices, Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Shihui Wen"", "",\u00a0Jiajia Zhou"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Dayong Jin""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""P.

letter,An integrated silicon photonic chip platform for continuous-variable quantum key distribution,"<p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a quantum communication technology that promises unconditional communication security. High-performance and cost-effective QKD systems are essential for the establishment of quantum communication networks. By integrating all the optical components (except the laser source) on a silicon photonic chip, we have realized a stable, miniaturized and low-cost system for continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) that is compatible with the existing fibre optical communication infrastructure. Here, the integrated silicon photonic chip is demonstrated for CV-QKD. It implements the widely studied Gaussian-modulated coherent state protocol that encodes continuous distributed information on the quadrature of laser light. Our proof-of-principle chip-based CV-QKD system is capable of producing a secret key rate of 0.14&#8201;kbps (under collective attack) over a simulated distance of 100&#8201;km in fibre, offering new possibilities for low-cost, scalable and portable quantum networks.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""G.

letter,Hot-electron emission processes in waveguide-integrated graphene,"<p>Photoemission plays a central role in a wide range of fields, from electronic structure measurements to free-electron laser sources. In metallic emitters, single-photon, multiphoton or strong-field emission processes are the primary photoemission mechanisms. Here, using a sub-work-function 3.06&#8201;eV continuous-wave laser, photoemission from waveguide-integrated monolayer graphene is observed to occur at peak power densities&#8201;&gt;5 orders of magnitude lower than reported multiphoton and strong-field emission. The behaviour is explained by the emission of hot electrons in graphene. In monolayer graphene, the need for photoelectrons to be transported to an emitting surface is eliminated, dramatically enhancing the probability of emission before thermalization. These results indicate that integrated-photonics-driven hot-electron emission provides a rich new area of exploration for both electron emission and integrated photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Fatemeh Rezaeifar"", "",\u00a0Ragib Ahsan"", "",\u00a0Qingfeng Lin"", "",\u00a0Hyun Uk Chae"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Rehan Kapadia""]}]",False,"[""Fatemeh Rezaeifar"", ""Ragib Ahsan"", ""Qingfeng Lin"", ""Hyun Uk Chae"", ""Rehan Kapadia""]","Rezaeifar, F., Ahsan, R., Lin, Q. et al.

letter,Topological strong-field physics on sub-laser-cycle timescale,"<p>The sub-laser-cycle timescale of the electronic response to strong fields enables attosecond dynamical imaging in atoms, molecules and solids, with optical tunnelling and high-harmonic generation the hallmarks of attosecond optical spectroscopy. Topological insulators are intimately linked with electron dynamics, as manifested via the chiral edge currents, but it is unclear if and how topology leaves its mark on optical tunnelling and sub-cycle electronic response. Here, we identify distinct bulk topological effects on directionality and timing of currents arising during electron injection into conduction bands. We show that electrons tunnel differently in trivial and topological insulators, for the same band structure, and identify the key role of the Berry curvature in this process. These effects map onto topologically dependent attosecond delays and helicities of emitted harmonics that record the phase diagram of the system. Our findings create new roadmaps in studies of topological systems, building on the ubiquitous properties of the sub-laser-cycle strong-field response&#8212;a unique mark of attosecond science.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Born-Institute, Berlin, Germany"", ""authors"": [""R.

letter,Broadband continuous single-mode tuning of a short-cavity quantum-cascade VECSEL,"<p>Changing the length of a laser cavity is a simple technique for continuously tuning the wavelength of a laser but is rarely used for broad fractional tuning, with a notable exception of the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). This is because, to avoid mode hopping, the cavity must be kept optically short to ensure a large free spectral range compared to the gain bandwidth of the amplifying material. Terahertz quantum-cascade lasers are ideal candidates for such a short cavity scheme as they demonstrate exceptional gain bandwidths (up to octave spanning) and can be integrated with broadband amplifying metasurfaces. We present such a quantum-cascade metasurface-based vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL) that exhibits over 20% continuous fractional tuning of a single laser mode. Such tuning is possible because the metasurface has subwavelength thickness, which allows lasing on low-order Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity modes. Good beam quality and high output power are simultaneously obtained.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Christopher A.

letter,Graphene-based metal-induced energy transfer for sub-nanometre optical localization,"<p>Single-molecule fluorescence imaging has become an indispensable tool for almost all fields of research, from fundamental physics to the life sciences. Among its most important applications is single-molecule localization super-resolution microscopy (SMLM) (for example, photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), fluorescent PALM (fPALM), direct STORM (dSTORM) and point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT)), which uses the fact that the centre position of a single molecule&#8217;s image can be determined with much higher accuracy than the size of that image itself. However, a big challenge of SMLM is to achieve super-resolution along the third dimension as well. Recently, metal-induced energy transfer (MIET) was introduced to axially localize fluorescent emitters. This exploits the energy transfer from an excited fluorophore to plasmons in a thin metal film. Here, we show that by using graphene as the &#8216;metal&#8217; layer, one can increase the localization accuracy of MIET by nearly tenfold. We demonstrate this by axially localizing single emitters and by measuring the thickness of lipid bilayers with &#229;ngstr&#246;m accuracy.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Third Institute of Physics \u2013 Biophysics, Georg August University, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Arindam Ghosh"", "",\u00a0Akshita Sharma"", "",\u00a0Alexey I.

letter,Synthetic chiral light for efficient control of chiral light–matter interaction,"<p>Light is a very powerful and precise tool, allowing us to control, shape and create new phases of matter. In such tasks, the magnetic component of a light wave is essential in defining the wave&#8217;s helicity, but it influences the optical response of matter only weakly. Chiral molecules offer a typical example, in which the weakness of magnetic interactions hampers our ability to control the strength of their chiro-optical response, limiting it at several orders of magnitude below the full potential. Here, we introduce and theoretically analyse a new type of chiral light: freely propagating, locally and globally chiral electric fields, which interact with chiral matter extremely efficiently. We show that this synthetic chiral light enables full control over the intensity, polarization and propagation direction of the nonlinear enantio-sensitive optical response of randomly oriented chiral molecules. This response can be quenched or enhanced at will in a desired enantiomer, opening up efficient ways to control chiral matter and for ultrafast imaging of chiral dynamics in gases, liquids and solids.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Max-Born-Institut, Berlin, Germany"", ""authors"": [""David Ayuso"", "",\u00a0Andres F.

article,Quantum wave–particle superposition in a delayed-choice experiment,"<p>Wave&#8211;particle duality epitomizes the counterintuitive character of quantum physics. A striking illustration is the quantum delayed-choice experiment, which is based on Wheeler&#8217;s classic delayed-choice gedanken experiment, but with the addition of a quantum-controlled device enabling wave-to-particle transitions. Here, we realize a quantum delayed-choice experiment in which we control the wave and the particle states of photons and particularly the phase between them, thus directly establishing the created quantum nature of the wave&#8211;particle. We generate three-photon entangled states and inject one photon into a Mach&#8211;Zehnder interferometer embedded in a 186-m-long two-photon Hong&#8211;Ou&#8211;Mandel interferometer. The third photon is sent 141&#8201;m away from the interferometers and remotely prepares a two-photon quantum gate according to independent active choices under Einstein locality conditions. We realize transitions between wave and particle states in both classical and quantum scenarios, and therefore tests of the complementarity principle that go fundamentally beyond earlier implementations.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"", ""authors"": [""Kai Wang"", "",\u00a0Qian Xu"", "",\u00a0Shining Zhu"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Xiao-song Ma""]}]",False,"[""Kai Wang"", ""Qian Xu"", ""Shining Zhu"", ""Xiao-song Ma""]","Wang, K., Xu, Q., Zhu, S. et al.

article,Transverse photon spin of bulk electromagnetic waves in bianisotropic media,"<p>Photons possess spin degree of freedom, which plays an important role in various applications such as optical communications, information processing and sensing. In isotropic media, photon spin is aligned with the propagation direction of light, obeying the principle of spin momentum locking. Interestingly, surface waves decaying away from an interface have a photon spin transverse to its propagation, opening exciting opportunities for the observation of spin-dependent excitation in confined systems. Here, we propose and realize transverse photon spin (T-spin) in a bulk medium, without relying on the presence of any interfaces. We show the mapping of the T-spin of surface modes to that of the bulk modes by introducing bianisotropy into the medium. We further discover that the interface between two bianisotropic media of opposite orientations supports edge-dependent propagating modes with tunable cutoff frequencies. Our results provide a new platform for manipulating the spin&#8211;orbit interaction of electromagnetic waves.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Key Laboratory for RF Circuits and Systems, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, China"", ""authors"": [""Liang Peng"", "",\u00a0Lingfu Duan"", "",\u00a0Kewen Wang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Gaofeng Wang""]}, {""address"": ""Interdisciplinary Center for Quantum Information, State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instrumentation, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"", ""authors"": [""Fei Gao"", "",\u00a0Li Zhang"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Hongsheng Chen""]}, {""address"": ""Division of Physics and Applied Physics, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"", ""authors"": [""Yihao Yang""]}, {""address"": ""School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"", ""authors"": [""Shuang Zhang""]}]",False,"[""Liang Peng"", ""Lingfu Duan"", ""Kewen Wang"", ""Fei Gao"", ""Li Zhang"", ""Gaofeng Wang"", ""Yihao Yang"", ""Hongsheng Chen"", ""Shuang Zhang""]","Peng, L., Duan, L., Wang, K. et al.

article,Observation of PT-symmetric quantum interference,"<p>A common wisdom in quantum mechanics is that the Hamiltonian has to be Hermitian in order to ensure a real eigenvalue spectrum. Yet, parity&#8211;time (PT)-symmetric Hamiltonians are sufficient for real eigenvalues and therefore constitute a complex extension of quantum mechanics beyond the constraints of Hermiticity. However, as only single-particle or classical wave physics has been exploited so far, an experimental demonstration of the true quantum nature of PT symmetry has been elusive. In our work, we demonstrate two-particle quantum interference in a PT-symmetric system. We employ integrated photonic waveguides to reveal that the quantum dynamics of indistinguishable photons shows strongly counterintuitive features. To substantiate our experimental data, we analytically solve the quantum master equation using Lie algebra methods. The ideas and results presented here pave the way for non-local PT-symmetric quantum mechanics as a novel building block for future quantum devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Physik, Universit\u00e4t Rostock, Rostock, Germany"", ""authors"": [""F.
