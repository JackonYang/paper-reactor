letter,Resonant excitation and all-optical switching of femtosecond soliton molecules,"<p>The emergence of confined structures and pattern formation are exceptional manifestations of nonlinear interactions found in a variety of physical, chemical and biological systems. Facilitated by optical nonlinearities, solitons enable ultrashort temporal confinement of light and stable propagation despite the presence of dispersion. Such particle-like structures can assemble in stable arrangements, forming &#8216;soliton molecules&#8217;. Recent work has revealed oscillatory internal motions of these bound states, akin to molecular vibrations, raising the question of how far the &#8216;molecular&#8217; analogy reaches, that is, whether further concepts from molecular spectroscopy apply and whether such intramolecular dynamics can be externally driven or manipulated. Here, we probe and control ultrashort bound states in an optical oscillator, using real-time spectral interferometry and time-dependent excitation. For a frequency-swept pump modulation, we analyse the nonlinear response and resolve anharmonicities in soliton interactions that lead to generation of overtones and sub-harmonics. Applying stronger stimuli, we demonstrate all-optical switching between states with different binding separations. These results could be applied to rapid pulse-pair generation and may stimulate the development of future instruments for ultrafast science.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IV.

letter,Time-stretch LiDAR as a spectrally scanned time-of-flight ranging camera,"<p>The need for imaging and ranging in robotics has brought LiDAR (light detection and ranging) to the forefront of consumer technology. Among various approaches, time-of-flight ranging sets the benchmark for robust operation due to illumination with high-energy pulses and direct detection. Conversely, spectrally scanning using tunable lasers is an inertia-free solution that offers fast scanning. The realization of a time-of-flight LiDAR with fast spectral scanning has not been possible because of difficulty in creating pulsed tunable sources. We demonstrate a wavelength-scanned time-of-flight LiDAR that realizes single-shot imaging and inertia-free scanning in one dimension with a rate of 1&#8201;MHz using a single laser and a single detector. We report two implementations of this concept, the first with a gain-switched supercontinuum source at 1,550&#8201;nm, and the second with a frequency-domain mode-locked laser at 1,060&#8201;nm. We show foveated imaging with both approaches as a potential solution to the big data predicament in three-dimensional imaging.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Yunshan Jiang"", "",\u00a0Sebastian Karpf"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Bahram Jalali""]}, {""address"": ""Institute of Biomedical Optics (BMO), University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Sebastian Karpf""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Bahram Jalali""]}, {""address"": ""California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Bahram Jalali""]}]",False,"[""Yunshan Jiang"", ""Sebastian Karpf"", ""Bahram Jalali""]","Jiang, Y., Karpf, S. & Jalali, B.

letter,Broadband reduction of quantum radiation pressure noise via squeezed light injection,"<p>The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the position of an object cannot be known with infinite precision, as the momentum of the object would then be totally uncertain. This momentum uncertainty then leads to position uncertainty in future measurements. When continuously measuring the position of an object, this quantum effect, known as back-action, limits the achievable precision. In audio-band, interferometer-type gravitational-wave detectors, this back-action effect manifests as quantum radiation pressure noise (QRPN) and will ultimately (but does not yet) limit sensitivity. Here, we present the use of a quantum engineered state of light to directly manipulate this quantum back-action in a system where it dominates the sensitivity in the 10&#8211;50&#8201;kHz range. We observe a reduction of 1.2&#8201;dB in the quantum back-action noise. This experiment is a crucial step in realizing QRPN reduction for future interferometric gravitational-wave detectors and improving their sensitivity.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""OzGrav, Department of Quantum Science, Research School of Physics, Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Min Jet Yap"", "",\u00a0Georgia L.

article,An integrated broadband spectrometer on thin-film lithium niobate,"<p>Optical spectrometry is a tool to investigate wavelength-dependent light&#8211;matter interactions and is widely used in astronomy, physics and chemistry. Integration and miniaturization of the currently bulky spectrometers will have an impact on applications where compactness and low complexity are key, such as air- and spaceborne missions. A high-resolution spectroscopy principle based on the near-field detection of a spatial standing wave inside a subwavelength waveguide has shown great promise to accomplish some of the aforementioned demands. However, small-scale devices based on this principle face strong bandwidth limitations due to undersampling of the standing wave. Here, we demonstrate an integrated single-waveguide Fourier transform spectrometer with an operational bandwidth of 500&#8201;nm in the near- and short-wavelength infrared, not relying on any moving components. The prototype device, with a footprint of less than 10&#8201;mm<sup>2</sup>, exploits the electro-optic properties of thin-film lithium niobate in order to retrieve the complete spatial interferogram.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Optical Nanomaterial Group, Institute for Quantum Electronics, Department of Physics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""David Pohl"", "",\u00a0Marc Reig Escal\u00e9"", "",\u00a0Fabian Kaufmann"", "",\u00a0Peter Brotzer"", "",\u00a0Anton Sergeyev"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Rachel Grange""]}, {""address"": ""Micos Engineering GmbH, D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Mohammad Madi"", "",\u00a0Philippe Giaccari"", "",\u00a0Edoardo Alberti"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Urs Meier""]}, {""address"": ""European Space Agency (ESA), European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), Noordwijk, the Netherlands"", ""authors"": [""Mohammad Madi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Benedikt Guldimann""]}]",False,"[""David Pohl"", ""Marc Reig Escal\u00e9"", ""Mohammad Madi"", ""Fabian Kaufmann"", ""Peter Brotzer"", ""Anton Sergeyev"", ""Benedikt Guldimann"", ""Philippe Giaccari"", ""Edoardo Alberti"", ""Urs Meier"", ""Rachel Grange""]","Pohl, D., Reig Escalé, M., Madi, M. et al.

article,Tunable isolated attosecond X-ray pulses with gigawatt peak power from a free-electron laser,"<p>The quantum-mechanical motion of electrons in molecules and solids occurs on the sub-femtosecond timescale. Consequently, the study of ultrafast electronic phenomena requires the generation of laser pulses shorter than 1 fs and of sufficient intensity to interact with their target with high probability. Probing these dynamics with atomic-site specificity requires the extension of sub-femtosecond pulses to the soft X-ray spectral region. Here, we report the generation of isolated soft X-ray attosecond pulses with an X-ray free-electron laser. Our source has a pulse energy that is millions of times larger than any other source of isolated attosecond pulses in the soft X-ray spectral region, with a peak power exceeding 100 GW. This unique combination of high intensity, high photon energy and short pulse duration enables the investigation of electron dynamics with X-ray nonlinear spectroscopy and single-particle imaging, unlocking a path towards a new era of attosecond science.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Joseph Duris"", "",\u00a0Siqi Li"", "",\u00a0Taran Driver"", "",\u00a0James P.

article,Ultrafast and energy-efficient all-optical switching with graphene-loaded deep-subwavelength plasmonic waveguides,"<p>All-optical switches have attracted attention because they can potentially overcome the speed limitation of electric switches. However, ultrafast, energy-efficient all-optical switches have been challenging to realize owing to the intrinsically small optical nonlinearity in existing materials. As a solution, we propose the use of graphene-loaded deep-subwavelength plasmonic waveguides (30&#8201;&#215;&#8201;20&#8201;nm<sup>2</sup>). Thanks to extreme light confinement, we have greatly enhanced optical nonlinear absorption in graphene, and achieved ultrafast all-optical switching with a switching energy of 35&#8201;fJ and a switching time of 260&#8201;fs. The switching energy is four orders of magnitude smaller than that in previous graphene-based devices and is the smallest value reported for any all-optical switch operating at a few picoseconds or less. This device can be efficiently connected to conventional silicon waveguides and used in silicon photonic integrated circuits.

article,Real-time phase tracking for wide-band optical frequency measurements at the 20th decimal place,"<p>Optical frequency measurements are among the most precise tools available to science.

This enables the characterization of optical frequency synthesis with stability and accuracy at the 20th decimal place within a measurement time of &lt;100&#8201;s.

article,Efficient colloidal quantum dot light-emitting diodes operating in the second near-infrared biological window,"<p>Semiconductor colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) offer size- and composition-tunable luminescence of high colour purity. Importantly, their emission can be tuned deep into the second biological near-infrared (NIR-II) window (1,000&#8211;1,700&#8201;nm).

article,Integrated gallium phosphide nonlinear photonics,"<p>Gallium phosphide (GaP) is an indirect-bandgap semiconductor used widely in solid-state lighting. Despite numerous intriguing optical properties&#8212;including large &#967;<sup>(2)</sup> and &#967;<sup>(3)</sup> coefficients, a high refractive index (&gt;3) and transparency from visible to long-infrared wavelengths (0.55&#8211;11&#8201;&#956;m)&#8212;its application as an integrated photonics material has been little studied. Here, we introduce GaP-on-insulator as a platform for nonlinear photonics, exploiting a direct wafer-bonding approach to realize integrated waveguides with 1.2&#8201;dB&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> loss in the telecommunications C-band (on par with Si-on-insulator). High-quality (Q&#8201;&gt;&#8201;10<sup>5</sup>), grating-coupled ring resonators are fabricated and studied. Employing a modulation transfer approach, we obtain a direct experimental estimate of the nonlinear index of GaP at telecommunication wavelengths: n<sub>2</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;1.1(3)&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;17</sup>&#8201;m<sup>2</sup>&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. We also observe Kerr frequency comb generation in resonators with engineered dispersion. Parametric threshold powers as low as 3&#8201;mW are realized, followed by broadband (&gt;100&#8201;nm) frequency combs with sub-THz spacing, frequency-doubled combs and, in a separate device, efficient Raman lasing. These results signal the emergence of GaP-on-insulator as a novel platform for integrated nonlinear photonics.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""IBM Research \u2013 Zurich, R\u00fcschlikon, Switzerland"", ""authors"": [""Dalziel J.
