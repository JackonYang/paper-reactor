letter,Triplet management for efficient perovskite light-emitting diodes,"<p>Perovskite light-emitting diodes are promising for next-generation lighting and displays because of their high colour purity and performance. Although the management of singlet and triplet excitons is fundamental to the design of efficient organic light-emitting diodes, the nature of how excitons affect performance is still not clear in perovskite and quasi-two-dimensional (2D) perovskite-based devices. Here, we show that triplet excitons are key to efficient emission in green quasi-2D perovskite devices and that quenching of triplets by the organic cation is a major loss path. Employing an organic cation with a high triplet energy level (phenylethylammonium) in a quasi-2D perovskite based on formamidinium lead bromide yields efficient harvesting of triplets. Furthermore, we show that upconversion of triplets to singlets can occur, making 100% harvesting of electrically generated excitons potentially possible. The external quantum and current efficiencies of our green (527&#8201;nm) devices reached 12.4% and 52.1&#8201;cd&#8201;A<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, respectively.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics Research (OPERA), c/o Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), ERATO, Adachi Molecular Exciton Engineering Project, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"", ""authors"": [""Chuanjiang Qin"", "",\u00a0Toshinori Matsushima"", "",\u00a0William J.

letter,Synthesizing multi-dimensional excitation dynamics and localization transition in one-dimensional lattices,"<p>The excitation dynamics in complex networks can describe the fundamental aspects of transport and localization across multiple fields of science, ranging from solid-state physics and photonics to biological signalling pathways and neuromorphic circuits. Although the effects of increasing network dimensionality are highly non-trivial, their implementation likewise becomes ever more challenging due to the exponentially growing numbers of sites and connections. To address these challenges, we formulate a universal approach for mapping arbitrary networks to synthesized one-dimensional lattices with strictly local inhomogeneous couplings, where the dynamics at the excited site is exactly replicated. We present direct experimental observations in judiciously designed planar photonic structures, showcasing non-monotonic excitation decays associated with up to seven-dimensional hypercubic lattices, and demonstrate a novel sharp localization transition specific to four and higher dimensions. The unprecedented capability of experimentally exploring multi-dimensional dynamics and harnessing their unique features in one-dimensional lattices can find multiple applications in diverse physical systems, including photonic integrated circuits.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Physik, Universit\u00e4t Rostock, Rostock, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Lukas J.

article,Higher-order topological states in photonic kagome crystals with long-range interactions,"<p>Photonic topological insulators enable topological boundary modes that are resilient to defects and disorder, irrespective of manufacturing precision. This property is known as topological protection. Although originally limited to dimensionality of modes one lower than that of topological insulators, the recently discovered higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) offer topological protection over an extended range of dimensionalities. Here, we introduce a photonic HOTI with kagome lattice that exhibits topological bulk polarization, leading to the emergence of one-dimensional edge states, as well as higher-order zero-dimensional states confined to the corners of the structure. Interestingly, in addition to the corner states due to nearest-neighbour interactions, we discover a new class of topological corner states induced by long-range interactions and specific to photonic systems. Our findings demonstrate that photonic HOTIs possess richer physics than their condensed-matter counterparts, offering opportunities for engineering novel designer electromagnetic states with unique topological robustness.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Grove School of Engineering, City College of New York, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Mengyao Li"", "",\u00a0Dmitry Zhirihin"", "",\u00a0Xiang Ni"", "",\u00a0Andrea Al\u00f9"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Alexander B.

article,Raman laser from an optical resonator with a grafted single-molecule monolayer,"<p>Raman-based technologies have enabled many ground-breaking scientific discoveries related to surface science, single-molecule chemistry and biology. For example, researchers have identified surface-bound molecules by their Raman vibrational modes and demonstrated polarization-dependent Raman gain. However, a surface-constrained Raman laser has yet to be demonstrated because of the challenges associated with achieving a sufficiently high photon population located at a surface to transition from spontaneous to stimulated Raman scattering. Here, advances in surface chemistry and in integrated photonics are combined to demonstrate lasing based on surface stimulated Raman scattering (SSRS). By creating an oriented, constrained Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si monolayer on the surface of integrated silica optical microresonators, the requisite conditions for SSRS are achieved with low threshold powers (200&#8201;&#956;W). The expected polarization dependence of SSRS due to the orientation of the Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si bond is observed. Owing to the ordered monolayer, the Raman lasing efficiency is improved from ~5% to over 40%.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Material Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Xiaoqin Shen"", "",\u00a0Hyungwoo Choi"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Andrea M.

article,Orbital angular momentum holography for high-security encryption,"<p>Holography has been identified as a vital platform for three-dimensional displays, optical encryption, microscopy and artificial intelligence through different physical dimensions. However, unlike the wavelength and polarization divisions, orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, despite its helical wavefront being an independent physical dimension, has not been implemented as an information carrier for holography due to the lack of helical mode index selectivity in the Bragg diffraction formula. Here, we demonstrate OAM holography by discovering strong OAM selectivity in the spatial-frequency domain without a theoretical helical mode index limit. As such, OAM holography allows the multiplexing of a wide range of OAM-dependent holographic images with a helical mode index spanning from &#8722;50 to 50, leading to a 10&#8201;bit OAM-encoded hologram for high-security optical encryption.

article,Photodoping through local charge carrier accumulation in alloyed hybrid perovskites for highly efficient luminescence,"<p>Metal halide perovskites have emerged as exceptional semiconductors for optoelectronic applications. Substitution of the monovalent cations has advanced luminescence yields and device efficiencies. Here, we control the cation alloying to enhance optoelectronic performance through alteration of the charge carrier dynamics in mixed-halide perovskites. In contrast to single-halide perovskites, we find high luminescence yields for photoexcited carrier densities far below solar illumination conditions. Using time-resolved spectroscopy we show that the charge carrier recombination regime changes from second to first order within the first tens of nanoseconds after excitation. Supported by microscale mapping of the optical bandgap, electrically gated transport measurements and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that spatially varying energetic disorder in the electronic states causes local charge accumulation, creating p- and n-type photodoped regions, which unearths a strategy for efficient light emission at low charge-injection in solar cells and light-emitting diodes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"", ""authors"": [""Sascha Feldmann"", "",\u00a0Stuart Macpherson"", "",\u00a0Satyaprasad P.
