letter,Programmable linear quantum networks with a multimode fibre,"<p>Reconfigurable quantum circuits are fundamental building blocks for the implementation of scalable quantum technologies. Their implementation has been pursued in linear optics through the engineering of sophisticated interferometers. Although such optical networks have been successful in demonstrating the control of small-scale quantum circuits, scaling up to larger dimensions poses significant challenges. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable route towards reconfigurable optical networks based on the use of a multimode fibre and advanced wavefront shaping techniques. We program networks involving spatial and polarization modes of the fibre and experimentally validate the accuracy and robustness of our approach using two-photon quantum states. In particular, we illustrate the reconfigurability of our platform by emulating a tunable coherent absorption experiment. By demonstrating reliable reprogrammable linear transformations, with the prospect to scale, our results highlight the potential of complex media driven by wavefront shaping for quantum information processing.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, ENS-PSL Research University, CNRS, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Coll\u00e8ge de France, Paris, France"", ""authors"": [""Saroch Leedumrongwatthanakun"", "",\u00a0Hugo Defienne"", "",\u00a0Thomas Juffmann"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Sylvain Gigan""]}, {""address"": ""Centre for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics, School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"", ""authors"": [""Luca Innocenti"", "",\u00a0Alessandro Ferraro"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Mauro Paternostro""]}, {""address"": ""School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"", ""authors"": [""Hugo Defienne""]}, {""address"": ""Faculty of Physics, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Thomas Juffmann""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Structural and Computational Biology, Max F.

letter,Ranging and light field imaging with transparent photodetectors,"<p>The core of any optical imaging system is a photodetector. Whether it is film or a semiconductor chip in a camera, or indeed the retina in an eye, conventional photodetectors are designed to absorb most of the incident light and record a projected two-dimensional (2D) distribution of light from a scene. The intensity distribution of light from 3D objects, however, can be described by a 4D light field, so optical imaging systems that can acquire higher dimensions of optical information are highly desirable. Here, we report a proof-of-concept light field imaging scheme using transparent graphene photodetector stacks. On a transparent substrate we fabricate a photodetector using graphene as the light-sensing layer, the conducting channel layer, the gate layer and interconnects, enabling sensitive light detection and high transparency at the same time. This technology opens up the possibility of developing sensor arrays that can be stacked along the light path, enabling entirely new configurations of optical imaging devices. We experimentally demonstrate depth ranging using a double stack of transparent detectors and develop a method for computational reconstruction of a 4D light field from a single exposure that can be applied following the successful fabrication of dense 2D transparent sensor arrays.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"", ""authors"": [""Miao-Bin Lien"", "",\u00a0Che-Hung Liu"", "",\u00a0Il Yong Chun"", "",\u00a0Saiprasad Ravishankar"", "",\u00a0Hung Nien"", "",\u00a0Minmin Zhou"", "",\u00a0Jeffrey A.

letter,Optimal wave fields for micromanipulation in complex scattering environments,"<p>The manipulation of small objects with light has become an indispensable tool in many areas of research, ranging from physics to biology and medicine. Here, we demonstrate how to implement micromanipulation at the optimal level of efficiency for arbitrarily shaped targets and inside complex environments such as disordered media. Our approach is to design wavefronts in the far field with optimal properties in the near field of the target to apply the strongest possible force, pressure or torque as well as to achieve the most efficient focus inside the target. This non-iterative technique only relies on a simple eigenvalue problem established from the system&#8217;s scattering matrix and its dependence on small shifts in specific target parameters (access to the near field of the target is not required). To illustrate this concept, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment in the microwave regime, fully confirming our predictions.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute for Theoretical Physics, Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Vienna, Austria"", ""authors"": [""Michael Horodynski"", "",\u00a0Matthias K\u00fchmayer"", "",\u00a0Andre Brandst\u00f6tter"", "",\u00a0Kevin Pichler"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Stefan Rotter""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Mathematics, King\u2019s College London, London, UK"", ""authors"": [""Yan V.

article,Efficient and stable Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite solar cell with tailored interlayer molecular interaction,"<p>Two-dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper phase (2DRP) perovskites are known to exhibit improved photostability and environmental stability compared with their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts. However, fundamental questions remain over the interaction between the bulky alkylammoniums and the 2DRP perovskite framework. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that a sulfur&#8211;sulfur interaction is present for a new bulky alkylammonium, 2-(methylthio)ethylamine hydrochloride (MTEACl). In addition to a weaker van der Waals interaction, the interaction between sulfur atoms in two MTEA molecules enables a (MTEA)<sub>2</sub>(MA)<sub>4</sub>Pb<sub>5</sub>I<sub>16</sub> (n&#8201;=&#8201;5) perovskite framework with enhanced charge transport and stabilization.

article,Snapshot photoacoustic topography through an ergodic relay for high-throughput imaging of optical absorption,"<p>Current embodiments of photoacoustic imaging require either serial detection with a single-element ultrasonic transducer or parallel detection with an ultrasonic array, necessitating a trade-off between cost and throughput. Here, we present photoacoustic topography through an ergodic relay (PATER) for low-cost high-throughput snapshot wide-field imaging. Encoding spatial information with randomized temporal signatures through ergodicity, PATER requires only a single-element ultrasonic transducer to capture a wide-field image with a single laser shot. We applied PATER to demonstrate both functional imaging of haemodynamic responses and high-speed imaging of blood pulse wave propagation in mice in vivo. Leveraging the high frame rate of 2&#8201;kHz, PATER tracked and localized moving melanoma tumour cells in the mouse brain in vivo, which enabled flow velocity quantification and super-resolution imaging.

article,Bright high-colour-purity deep-blue carbon dot light-emitting diodes via efficient edge amination,"<p>Deep-blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (emitting at wavelengths of less than 450&#8201;nm) are important for solid-state lighting, vivid displays and high-density information storage. Colloidal quantum dots, typically based on heavy metals such as cadmium and lead, are promising candidates for deep-blue LEDs, but these have so far had external quantum efficiencies lower than 1.7%. Here we present deep-blue light-emitting materials and devices based on carbon dots. The carbon dots produce emission with a narrow full-width at half-maximum (about 35&#8201;nm) with high photoluminescence quantum yield (70%&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10%) and a colour coordinate (0.15, 0.05) closely approaching the standard colour Rec. 2020 (0.131, 0.046) specification. Structural and optical characterization, together with computational studies, reveal that amine-based passivation accounts for the efficient and high-colour-purity emission. Deep-blue LEDs based on these carbon dots display high performance with a maximum luminance of 5,240&#8201;cd m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and an external quantum efficiency of 4%, notably exceeding that of previously reported quantum-tuned solution-processed deep-blue LEDs.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Fanglong Yuan"", "",\u00a0Peicheng Li"", "",\u00a0Hao Kung"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Zheng-Hong Lu""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Fanglong Yuan"", "",\u00a0Ya-Kun Wang"", "",\u00a0Yitong Dong"", "",\u00a0Andrew Johnston"", "",\u00a0Golam Bappi"", "",\u00a0James Z.

article,Spectral super-resolution spectroscopy using a random laser,"<p>Super-resolution microscopy refers to a powerful set of imaging techniques that overcome the diffraction limit. Some of these techniques, the importance of which was recognized by the 2014 Nobel Prize for chemistry, are based on the concept of image reconstruction by spatially sparse sampling. Here, we introduce the concept of super-resolution spectroscopy based on sparse sampling in the frequency domain, and show that this can be naturally achieved using a random laser source. In its chaotic regime, the emission spectrum of a random laser features sharp spikes at uncorrelated frequencies that are sparsely distributed over the emission bandwidth. These narrow lasing modes probe stochastically the spectral response of a sample, allowing it to be reconstructed with a resolution exceeding that of the spectrometer. We envision that the proposed technique will inspire a new generation of simple, cheap, high-resolution spectroscopy tools with a reduced footprint.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy (LENS), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy"", ""authors"": [""Alice Boschetti"", "",\u00a0Andrea Taschin"", "",\u00a0Paolo Bartolini"", "",\u00a0Lorenzo Pattelli"", "",\u00a0Renato Torre"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Diederik S.

article,Attosecond spectral singularities in solid-state high-harmonic generation,"<p>Strong-field-driven electric currents in condensed-matter systems are opening new frontiers in petahertz electronics. In this regime, new challenges are arising as the roles of band structure and coherent electron&#8211;hole dynamics have yet to be resolved. Here, by using high-harmonic generation spectroscopy, we reveal the underlying attosecond dynamics that dictates the temporal evolution of carriers in multi-band solid-state systems. We demonstrate that when the electron&#8211;hole relative velocity approaches zero, enhanced constructive interference leads to the appearance of spectral caustics in the high-harmonic generation spectrum. We introduce the role of the dynamical joint density of states and identify its mapping into the spectrum, which exhibits singularities at the spectral caustics.

article,Spatial molecular interferometry via multidimensional high-harmonic spectroscopy,"<p>Interferometry is a basic tool to resolve coherent properties in a wide range of light or matter wave phenomena. In the strong-field regime, interferometry serves as a fundamental building block in revealing ultrafast electron dynamics. In this work we manipulate strong-field-driven electron trajectories and probe the coherence of a molecular wavefunction by inducing an interferometer on a microscopic level. The two arms of the interferometer are controlled by a two-colour field, while the interference pattern is read via advanced, three-dimensional high-harmonic spectroscopy. This scheme recovers the spectral phase information associated with the structure of molecular orbitals, as well as the spatial properties of the interaction itself. Zooming into one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena&#8212;field-induced tunnel ionization&#8212;we reconstruct the angle at which the electronic wavefunction tunnels through the barrier and follow its evolution with attosecond precision.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"", ""authors"": [""Ayelet J.
