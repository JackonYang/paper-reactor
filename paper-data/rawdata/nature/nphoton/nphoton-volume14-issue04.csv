letter,Large-area near-infrared perovskite light-emitting diodes,"<p>The performance of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has progressed rapidly in recent years, with electroluminescence efficiency now reaching 20%. However, devices, so far, have featured small areas and usually show notable variation in device-to-device performance. Here, we show that the origin of suboptimal device performance stems from inadequate hole injection, and that the use of a hole-transporting polymer with a shallower ionization potential can improve device charge balance, efficiency and reproducibility. Using an ITO/ZnO/PEIE/FAPbI<sub>3</sub>/poly-TPD/MoO<sub>3</sub>/Al device structure, we report a 799&#8201;nm near-infrared PeLED that operates with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.2%, at a current density of 57&#8201;mA&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> and a radiance of 57&#8201;W&#8201;sr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>.

letter,Attosecond-fast internal photoemission,"<p>The photoelectric effect has a sister process relevant in optoelectronics called internal photoemission.

letter,Generation and control of frequency-dependent squeezing via Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement,"<p>Quantum noise-limited displacement sensors such as gravitational wave detectors can be improved by using non-classical light. This has been achieved in limited bands and in a single quadrature (that is, only one of a pair of conjugate variables) by injecting single-mode squeezed vacuum states. Quantum noise in gravitational wave detectors, however, results from input noise in both quadratures, with the dominant quadrature being a function of Fourier frequency. Broadband reduction of this noise via squeezed light injection then requires a method of rotating this quadrature. This can be accomplished with a low-loss, all-pass optical filter with bandwidth in the low audio frequencies, a substantial technical challenge. We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a recent proposal to use two-mode squeezed vacuum states with Einstein&#8211;Podolsky&#8211;Rosen (EPR) entanglement, which allows the gravitational detector to simultaneously serve as the optical filter, eliminating the need for a separate apparatus.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""OzGrav, Centre for Gravitational Astrophysics, Research School of Physics & Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Australian National University, Acton, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Min Jet Yap"", "",\u00a0Paul Altin"", "",\u00a0Terry G.

letter,Efficient near-infrared light-emitting diodes based on quantum dots in layered perovskite,"<p>Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on excitonic material systems, in which tightly bound photoexcited electron&#8211;hole pairs migrate together rather than as individual charge carriers, offer an attractive route to developing solution-processed, high-performance light emitters. Here, we demonstrate bright, efficient, excitonic infrared LEDs through the incorporation of quantum dots (QDs) into a low-dimensional perovskite matrix. We program the surface of the QDs to trigger fast perovskite nucleation to achieve homogeneous incorporation of QDs into the matrix without detrimental QD aggregation, as verified by in situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray spectroscopy. We tailor the distribution of the perovskites to drive balanced ultrafast excitonic energy transfer to the QDs. The resulting LEDs operate in the short-wavelength infrared region, an important regime for imaging and sensing applications, and exhibit a high external quantum efficiency of 8.1% at 980&#8201;nm at a radiance of up to 7.4&#8201;W&#8201;Sr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"", ""authors"": [""Liang Gao"", "",\u00a0Li Na Quan"", "",\u00a0F.

letter,Nanophotonic phase noise filter in silicon,"<p>Narrow-linewidth light sources have far-reaching applications from communication to metrology. Benchtop linewidth reduction methods such as feedback and feed-forward schemes have been used to reduce the linewidth of lasers. The feedback scheme typically has a limited bandwidth and depends on the laser characteristics and the feed-forward scheme is highly sensitive to gain and delay mismatches. Here, we report the demonstration of an integrated nanophotonic phase noise filter, which can be placed after a low-cost laser to significantly suppress its phase noise independent of the light source. The hybrid-integrated electronic&#8211;photonic system measures and suppresses the phase noise of the input light using an electronic&#8211;photonic loop without interacting with the light source. Using the integrated phase noise filter, laser linewidth reduction from 2.55&#8201;MHz to 4&#8201;kHz and from 200&#8201;kHz to 320&#8201;Hz is demonstrated.

article,Demonstration of interferometer enhancement through Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement,"<p>The recent series of gravitational-wave detections by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observatories have launched the new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. As the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors is limited by the quantum noise of light, concepts from quantum metrology have been adapted to increase the observational range. Since 2010, squeezed light with reduced quantum noise has been used to achieve improved sensitivity at signal frequencies above 100&#8201;Hz. However, 100-m-long optical filter resonators would be required to also improve the sensitivity at lower frequencies, adding significant cost and complexity. Here, we report a proof-of-principle set-up of an alternative concept that achieves the broadband noise reduction by using Einstein&#8211;Podolsky&#8211;Rosen entangled states instead. We show that the desired sensitivity improvement can then be obtained with the signal recycling resonator that is already part of current observatories, providing a viable alternative to high-cost filter cavities.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institut f\u00fcr Laserphysik und Zentrum f\u00fcr Optische Quantentechnologien der Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Jan S\u00fcdbeck"", "",\u00a0Sebastian Steinlechner"", "",\u00a0Mikhail Korobko"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Roman Schnabel""]}]",False,"[""Jan S\u00fcdbeck"", ""Sebastian Steinlechner"", ""Mikhail Korobko"", ""Roman Schnabel""]","Südbeck, J., Steinlechner, S., Korobko, M. et al.

article,Towards jitter-free ultrafast electron diffraction technology,"<p>Stroboscopic visualization of nuclear or electron dynamics in atoms, molecules or solids requires ultrafast pump and probe pulses and a close to perfect synchronization between the two. We have developed a 3&#8201;MeV ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) probe technology that nominally reduces the electron bunch duration and the arrival time jitter to the subfemtosecond level. This simple configuration uses a radiofrequency photogun and a 90&#176; achromatic bend and is designed to provide effectively jitter-free conditions. Terahertz streaking measurements reveal an electron bunch duration of 25&#8201;fs, even for a charge as high as 0.6&#8201;pC, and an arrival time jitter of 7.8&#8201;fs, the latter limited by only the measurement accuracy. From pump&#8211;probe measurements of photoexcited bismuth films, the instrument response function was determined to be 31&#8201;fs.

article,Demonstration of sub-3 ps temporal resolution with a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector,"<p>Improvements in temporal resolution of single-photon detectors enable increased data rates and transmission distances for both classical and quantum optical communication systems, higher spatial resolution in laser ranging, and observation of shorter-lived fluorophores in biomedical imaging. In recent years, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the most efficient time-resolving single-photon-counting detectors available in the near-infrared, but understanding of the fundamental limits of timing resolution in these devices has been limited due to a lack of investigations into the timescales involved in the detection process. We introduce an experimental technique to probe the detection latency in SNSPDs and show that the key to achieving low timing jitter is the use of materials with low latency. By using a specialized niobium nitride SNSPD we demonstrate that the system temporal resolution can be as good as 2.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.2&#8201;ps for visible wavelengths and 4.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.2&#8201;ps at 1,550&#8201;nm.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"", ""authors"": [""Boris Korzh"", "",\u00a0Jason P.

article,Low-loss composite photonic platform based on 2D semiconductor monolayers,"<p>The optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are known to change dramatically with doping near their excitonic resonances. However, little is known about the effect of doping on the optical properties of TMDs at wavelengths far from these resonances, where the material is transparent and therefore could be leveraged in photonic circuits. We demonstrate the strong electrorefractive response of monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) at near-infrared wavelengths (deep in the transparency regime) by integrating it on silicon nitride photonic structures to enhance the light&#8211;matter interaction with the monolayer. We show that the doping-induced phase change relative to the change in absorption (|&#8710;n/&#8710;k|) is ~125, which is significantly higher than the |&#8710;n/&#8710;k| observed in materials commonly employed for silicon photonic modulators, including Si and III&#8211;V on Si, while accompanied by negligible insertion loss.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ipshita Datta"", "",\u00a0Gaurang R.
