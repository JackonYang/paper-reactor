review article,Integrated photonic quantum technologies,"<p>Quantum technologies comprise an emerging class of devices capable of controlling superposition and entanglement of quantum states of light or matter, to realize fundamental performance advantages over ordinary classical machines. The technology of integrated quantum photonics has enabled the generation, processing and detection of quantum states of light at a steadily increasing scale and level of complexity, progressing from few-component circuitry occupying centimetre-scale footprints and operating on two photons, to programmable devices approaching 1,000 components occupying millimetre-scale footprints with integrated generation of multiphoton states.

review article,Hybrid integrated quantum photonic circuits,"<p>Recent developments in chip-based photonic quantum circuits have radically impacted quantum information processing. However, it is challenging for monolithic photonic platforms to meet the stringent demands of most quantum applications. Hybrid platforms combining different photonic technologies in a single functional unit have great potential to overcome the limitations of monolithic photonic circuits. Our Review summarizes the progress of hybrid quantum photonics integration, discusses important design considerations, including optical connectivity and operation conditions, and highlights several successful realizations of key physical resources for building a quantum teleporter. We conclude by discussing the roadmap for realizing future advanced large-scale hybrid devices, beyond the solid-state platform, which hold great potential for quantum information applications.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Applied Physics, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"", ""authors"": [""Ali W.

letter,High-efficiency organic solar cells with low non-radiative recombination loss and low energetic disorder,"<p>Energy loss within organic solar cells (OSCs) is undesirable as it reduces cell efficiency. In particular, non-radiative recombination loss and energetic disorder, which are closely related to the tail states below the band edge and the overall photon energy loss, need to be minimized to improve cell performance. Here, we report how the use of a small-molecule acceptor with torsion-free molecular conformation can achieve a very low degree of energetic disorder and mitigate energy loss in OSCs. The resulting single-junction OSC has an energy loss due to non-radiative recombination of just 0.17&#8201;eV and a high power conversion efficiency of up to 16.54% (certified as 15.89% by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory). The findings take studies of organic photovoltaics deeper into a new regime, beyond the limits of energetic disorder and large energy offset for charge generation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Institute of Polymer Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, State Key Laboratory of Luminescent Materials and Devices, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, P.

letter,A high-fidelity heralded quantum squeezing gate,"<p>Squeezing operation is critical for continuous-variable quantum information, enabling encoding of information in phase space to a resolution otherwise forbidden by vacuum noise. A universal squeezing gate that can squeeze arbitrary input states is particularly essential for continuous-variable quantum computation. However, the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art implementations is ultimately limited due to their reliance on first synthesizing squeezed vacuum modes of unbounded energy. Here, we circumvent this fundamental limitation by using a heralded squeezing gate. This allows improved gate fidelity without requiring more squeezed ancillary vacuum. For a specific target squeezing level for coherent states, we present measured fidelities higher than what would be possible using non-heralded schemes that utilize up to 15&#8201;dB (ref. ) of best available ancilla squeezing. Our technique can be applied to non-Gaussian states and provides a promising pathway towards high-fidelity gate operations and fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, Department of Quantum Science, Research School of Physics and Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia"", ""authors"": [""Jie Zhao"", "",\u00a0Hao Jeng"", "",\u00a0Ping Koy Lam"", ""\u00a0&\u00a0Syed M.

letter,Luminescent surfaces with tailored angular emission for compact dark-field imaging devices,"<p>Dark-field microscopy is a standard imaging technique widely employed in biology that provides high image contrast for a broad range of unstained specimens. Unlike bright-field microscopy, it accentuates high spatial frequencies and can therefore be used to emphasize and resolve small features. However, the use of dark-field microscopy for reliable analysis of blood cells, bacteria, algae and other marine organisms often requires specialized, bulky microscope systems, as well as expensive additional components, such as dark-field-compatible objectives or condensers. Here, we propose to simplify and downsize dark-field microscopy equipment by generating the high-angle illumination cone required for dark-field microscopy directly within the sample substrate. We introduce a luminescent photonic substrate with a controlled angular emission profile and demonstrate its ability to generate high-contrast dark-field images of micrometre-sized living organisms using standard optical microscopy equipment. This new type of substrate forms the basis for miniaturized lab-on-chip dark-field imaging devices that are compatible with simple and compact light microscopes.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Mechanical Engineering Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"", ""authors"": [""C\u00e9cile A.

article,Flat optics for image differentiation,"<p>Image processing has become a critical technology in a variety of science and engineering disciplines. Although most image processing is performed digitally, optical analog processing has the advantages of being low-power and high-speed, but it requires a large volume. Here, we demonstrate flat optics for direct image differentiation, allowing us to significantly shrink the required optical system size. We first demonstrate how the differentiator can be combined with traditional imaging systems such as a commercial optical microscope and camera sensor for edge detection with a numerical aperture up to 0.32. We next demonstrate how the entire processing system can be realized as a monolithic compound flat optic by integrating the differentiator with a metalens. The compound nanophotonic system manifests the advantage of thin form factor as well as the ability to implement complex transfer functions, and could open new opportunities in applications such as biological imaging and computer vision.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Interdisciplinary Materials Science Program, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"", ""authors"": [""You Zhou""]}, {""address"": ""Department of Electric Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"", ""authors"": [""Hanyu Zheng""]}, {""address"": ""Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"", ""authors"": [""Ivan I.

article,Dynamics and efficient conversion of excitons to trions in non-uniformly strained monolayer WS2,"<p>In recent years, there has been ongoing effort in achieving efficient transport of excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides subjected to highly non-uniform strain. Here we investigate the transport of excitons and trions in monolayer semiconductor WS<sub>2</sub> subjected to controlled non-uniform mechanical strain. An atomic force microscope (AFM)-based setup is applied to actively control and tune the strain profiles by indenting the monolayer with an AFM tip. Optical spectroscopy is used to reveal the dynamics of the excited carriers. The non-uniform strain configuration locally changes the valence and conduction bands of WS<sub>2</sub>, giving rise to effective forces attracting excitons and trions towards the point of maximum strain underneath the AFM tip. We observe large changes in the photoluminescence spectra of WS<sub>2</sub> under strain, which we interpret using a drift&#8211;diffusion model. We show that the transport of neutral excitons, a process that was previously thought to be efficient in non-uniformly strained two-dimensional semiconductors and termed as funnelling, is negligible at room temperature, in contrast to previous observations. Conversely, we discover that redistribution of free carriers under non-uniform strain profiles leads to highly efficient conversion of excitons to trions. Conversion efficiency reaches up to about 100% even without electrical gating. Our results explain inconsistencies in previous experiments and pave the way towards new types of optoelectronic devices.</p>",,"[{""address"": ""Department of Physics, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"", ""authors"": [""Moshe G.

This entails the efficient integration of optically addressable qubits into photonic circuits, as well as quantum frequency conversion to the telecommunications band. 4H-silicon carbide (4H-SiC) offers unique potential for on-chip quantum photonics, as it hosts a variety of promising colour centres and has a strong second-order optical nonlinearity. Here, we demonstrate within a single, monolithic platform the strong enhancement of emission from a colour centre and efficient optical frequency conversion. We develop a fabrication process for thin films of 4H-SiC, which are compatible with industry-standard, CMOS nanofabrication.
