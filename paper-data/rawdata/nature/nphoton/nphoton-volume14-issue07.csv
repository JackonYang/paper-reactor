letter,Test of general relativity by a pair of transportable optical lattice clocks,"<p>A clock at a higher altitude ticks faster than one at a lower altitude, in accordance with Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity. The outstanding stability and accuracy of optical clocks, at 10<sup>&#8722;18</sup> levels, allows height differences of a centimetre to be measured. However, such state-of-the-art clocks have been demonstrated only in well-conditioned laboratories. Here, we demonstrate an 18-digit-precision frequency comparison in a broadcasting tower, Tokyo Skytree, by developing transportable optical lattice clocks. The tower provides the clocks with adverse conditions to test the robustness and a 450&#8201;m height difference to test the gravitational redshift at (1.4&#8201;&#177;&#8201;9.1)&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>. The result improves ground-based clock comparisons by an order of magnitude and is comparable with space experiments. Our demonstration shows that optical clocks resolving centimetres are technically ready for field applications, such as monitoring spatiotemporal changes of geopotentials caused by active volcanoes or crustal deformation and for defining the geoid, which will have an immense impact on future society.</p>",,[],False,"[""Masao Takamoto"", ""Ichiro Ushijima"", ""Noriaki Ohmae"", ""Toshihiro Yahagi"", ""Kensuke Kokado"", ""Hisaaki Shinkai"", ""Hidetoshi Katori""]","Takamoto, M., Ushijima, I., Ohmae, N. et al.

letter,Anomalous refraction of optical spacetime wave packets,"<p>Refraction at the interface between two materials is fundamental to the interaction of light with photonic devices and to the propagation of light through the atmosphere at large. Underpinning the traditional rules for the refraction of an optical field is the tacit presumption of the separability of its spatial and temporal degrees of freedom. We show here that endowing a pulsed beam with precise spatiotemporal spectral correlations unveils remarkable refractory phenomena, such as group-velocity invariance with respect to the refractive index, group-delay cancellation, anomalous group-velocity increase in higher-index materials, and tunable group velocity by varying the angle of incidence. A law of refraction for &#8216;spacetime&#8217; (ST) wave packets encompassing these effects is verified experimentally in a variety of optical materials. Spacetime refraction defies our expectations derived from Fermat&#8217;s principle and offers new opportunities for moulding the flow of light and other wave phenomena.</p>",,[],False,"[""Basanta Bhaduri"", ""Murat Yessenov"", ""Ayman F.

letter,Implementation of quantum key distribution surpassing the linear rate-transmittance bound,"<p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a long-term solution to secure key exchange. Due to photon loss in transmission, it was believed that the repeaterless key rate is bounded by a linear function of the transmittance, O(&#951;), limiting the maximal secure transmission distance. Recently, a novel type of QKD scheme has been shown to beat the linear bound and achieve a key rate performance of O(√η). Here, by employing the laser injection technique and the phase post-compensation method, we match the modes of two independent lasers and overcome the phase fluctuation. As a result, the key rate surpasses the linear bound via 302&#8201;km and 402&#8201;km commercial-fibre channels, over four orders of magnitude higher than existing results. Furthermore, our system yields a secret key rate of 0.118&#8201;bps with a 502&#8201;km ultralow-loss fibre. This new type of QKD pushes forward long-distance quantum communication for the future quantum internet.</p>",,[],False,"[""Xiao-Tian Fang"", ""Pei Zeng"", ""Hui Liu"", ""Mi Zou"", ""Weijie Wu"", ""Yan-Lin Tang"", ""Ying-Jie Sheng"", ""Yao Xiang"", ""Weijun Zhang"", ""Hao Li"", ""Zhen Wang"", ""Lixing You"", ""Ming-Jun Li"", ""Hao Chen"", ""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Qiang Zhang"", ""Cheng-Zhi Peng"", ""Xiongfeng Ma"", ""Teng-Yun Chen"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Fang, X., Zeng, P., Liu, H. et al.

article,Exciton resonance tuning of an atomically thin lens,"<p>The highly engineerable scattering properties of resonant optical antennas underpin the operation of metasurface-based flat optics. Thus far, the choice of antenna has been limited to shaped metallic and high-index semiconductor nanostructures that support geometrical plasmonic or Mie resonances. Whereas these resonant elements offer strong light&#8211;matter interaction and excellent control over the scattering phase and amplitude, their electrical tunability has proven to be quite limited. Here, we demonstrate how excitonic resonances in atomically thin semiconductors can be harnessed as a different, third type of resonance to create mutable, flat optics. These strong materials-based resonances are unmatched in their tunability with various external stimuli. To illustrate the concept, we first demonstrate how excitons can enhance the focusing efficiency of a millimetre-scale, patterned WS<sub>2</sub> zone plate lens. We also show how electrical gating can completely turn on and off the exciton resonance and thereby modulate the focusing efficiency by 33%.</p>",,[],False,"[""Jorik van de Groep"", ""Jung-Hwan Song"", ""Umberto Celano"", ""Qitong Li"", ""Pieter G.

article,Structured illumination microscopy using a photonic chip,"<p>Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) enables live-cell super-resolution imaging of subcellular structures at high speeds. At present, linear SIM uses free-space optics to illuminate the sample with the desired light patterns; however, such arrangements are prone to misalignment and add cost and complexity to the microscope. Here, we present an alternative photonic chip-based two-dimensional SIM approach (cSIM) in which the conventional glass sample slide in a microscope is replaced by a planar photonic chip that importantly both holds and illuminates the specimen. The photonic chip reduces the footprint of the light illumination path of SIM to around 4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;4&#8201;cm<sup>2</sup>. An array of optical waveguides on the chip creates standing wave interference patterns at different angles, which illuminate the sample via evanescent fields. High-refractive-index silicon nitride waveguides allow a 2.3 times enhancement in imaging spatial resolution, exceeding the usual 2 times limit of SIM. In summary, cSIM offers a simple, stable and affordable approach for performing two-dimensional super-resolution imaging over a large field of view.</p>",,[],False,"[""\u00d8ystein Ivar Helle"", ""Firehun Tsige Dullo"", ""Marcel Lahrberg"", ""Jean-Claude Tinguely"", ""Olav Gaute Helles\u00f8"", ""Balpreet Singh Ahluwalia""]","Helle, Ø.I., Dullo, F.T., Lahrberg, M. et al.

article,Transscleral optical phase imaging of the human retina,"<p>In vivo observation of the human retina at the cellular level is crucial to detect the first signs of retinal diseases and properly treat them. Despite the phenomenal advances in adaptive optics systems, clinical imaging of many retinal cells is still elusive due to the low signal-to-noise ratio induced by transpupillary illumination. We present a transscleral optical phase imaging method, which relies on high-angle oblique illumination of the retina, combined with adaptive optics, to enhance cell contrast. Examination of 11 healthy volunteer eyes, without pupil dilation, shows the ability of this method to produce in vivo images of retinal cells, from the retinal pigment epithelium to the nerve fibre layer. This method also allows the generation of high-resolution label-free ex vivo phase images of flat-mounted retinas. The in vivo images with 4.4&#176;&#8201;&#215;&#8201;4.4&#176; field of view are recorded in less than 10&#8201;s, opening new avenues in the exploration of healthy and diseased retinas.</p>",,[],False,"[""Timoth\u00e9 Laforest"", ""Mathieu K\u00fcnzi"", ""Laura Kowalczuk"", ""Dino Carpentras"", ""Francine Behar-Cohen"", ""Christophe Moser""]","Laforest, T., Künzi, M., Kowalczuk, L. et al.

article,Terahertz topological photonics for on-chip communication,"<p>The realization of integrated, low-cost and efficient solutions for high-speed, on-chip communication requires terahertz-frequency waveguides and has great potential for information and communication technologies, including sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, terahertz integrated circuits, and interconnects for intrachip and interchip communication. However, conventional approaches to terahertz waveguiding suffer from sensitivity to defects and sharp bends. Here, building on the topological phase of light, we experimentally demonstrate robust terahertz topological valley transport through several sharp bends on the all-silicon chip. The valley kink states are excellent information carriers owing to their robustness, single-mode propagation and linear dispersion. By leveraging such states, we demonstrate error-free communication through a highly twisted domain wall at an unprecedented data transfer rate (exceeding ten gigabits per second) that enables real-time transmission of uncompressed 4K high-definition video (that is, with a horizontal display resolution of approximately 4,000 pixels). Terahertz communication with topological devices opens a route towards terabit-per-second datalinks that could enable artificial intelligence and cloud-based technologies, including autonomous driving, healthcare, precision manufacturing and holographic communication.</p>",,[],False,"[""Yihao Yang"", ""Yuichiro Yamagami"", ""Xiongbin Yu"", ""Prakash Pitchappa"", ""Julian Webber"", ""Baile Zhang"", ""Masayuki Fujita"", ""Tadao Nagatsuma"", ""Ranjan Singh""]","Yang, Y., Yamagami, Y., Yu, X. et al.

article,Monitoring contractility in cardiac tissue with cellular resolution using biointegrated microlasers,"<p>The contractility of cardiac cells is a key parameter that describes the biomechanical characteristics of the beating heart, but functional monitoring of three-dimensional cardiac tissue with single-cell resolution remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce microscopic whispering-gallery-mode lasers into cardiac cells to realize all-optical recording of transient cardiac contraction profiles with cellular resolution. The brilliant emission and high spectral sensitivity of microlasers to local changes in refractive index enable long-term tracking of individual cardiac cells, monitoring of drug administration, accurate measurements of organ-scale contractility in live zebrafish, and robust contractility sensing through hundreds of micrometres of rat heart tissue. Our study reveals changes in sarcomeric protein density as an underlying factor to cardiac contraction.
