letter,Phase-locked laser-wakefield electron acceleration,"<p>Subluminal and superluminal light pulses have attracted considerable attention in recent decades, opening perspectives in telecommunications, optical storage and fundamental physics. Usually achieved in matter, superluminal propagation has also been demonstrated in vacuum with quasi-Bessel beams or spatio-temporal couplings. Although, in the first case, the propagation was diffraction free, but with hardly controllable pulse velocities and limited to moderate intensities, in the second, high tunability was achieved, but with substantially lengthened pulse durations. Here we report a new concept that extends these approaches to relativistic intensities and ultrashort pulses by mixing spatio-temporal couplings and quasi-Bessel beams to independently control the light velocity and intensity. When used to drive a laser-plasma accelerator, this concept leads to a new regime that is dephasing free, where the electron beam energy gain increases by more than one order of magnitude.</p>",,[],False,"[""C.

letter,Thermal decoherence and laser cooling of Kerr microresonator solitons,"<p>Thermal noise is ubiquitous in microscopic systems and high-precision measurements. The control of thermal noise would reveal quantum regimes and enable fundamental physics searches. Recently, nonlinearity in microresonators has enabled laser devices such as Kerr microresonator soliton frequency combs. Soliton microcombs explore nonlinear dynamics and enable optical synthesizers, optical clockwork and data communications systems. Here, we explore how thermal noise leads to the fundamental decoherence of microcombs. We show that a particle-like soliton, which is an ensemble of comb modes, is closely coupled to the thermal fluctuations of its silicon-chip-based resonator. The microcomb modal linewidth is thus thermally broadened, and we characterize these thermal-noise correlations through a soliton effective temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that passive laser cooling reduces soliton thermal decoherence to far below the ambient-temperature limit. We implement laser cooling by photothermal forcing, and we observe cooling of the frequency comb modes to 84&#8201;K. Our work illuminates inherent connections between nonlinear photonics and microscopic fluctuations.</p>",,[],False,"[""Tara E. Drake"", ""Jordan R. Stone"", ""Travis C. Briles"", ""Scott B.

article,Photonic microwave generation in the X- and K-band using integrated soliton microcombs,"<p>Microwave photonic technologies, which upshift the carrier into the optical domain, have facilitated the generation and processing of ultra-wideband electronic signals at vastly reduced fractional bandwidths. For microwave photonic applications such as radars, optical communications and low-noise microwave generation, optical frequency combs are useful building blocks. By virtue of soliton microcombs, frequency combs can now be built using CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuits. Yet, currently developed integrated soliton microcombs all operate with repetition rates significantly beyond those that conventional electronics can detect, preventing their use in microwave photonics. Access to this regime is challenging due to the required ultra-low waveguide loss and large dimensions of the nanophotonic resonators. Here, we demonstrate soliton microcombs operating in two widely employed microwave bands, the X-band (~10&#8201;GHz, for radar) and the K-band (~20&#8201;GHz, for 5G). Driven by a low-noise fibre laser, these devices produce more than 300 frequency lines within the 3&#8201;dB bandwidth, and generate microwave signals featuring phase noise levels comparable to modern electronic microwave oscillators. Our results establish integrated microcombs as viable low-noise microwave generators. Furthermore, the low soliton repetition rates are critical for future dense wavelength-division multiplexing channel generation schemes and could significantly reduce the system complexity of soliton-based integrated frequency synthesizers and atomic clocks.</p>",,[],False,"[""Junqiu Liu"", ""Erwan Lucas"", ""Arslan S.

article,The pure-quartic soliton laser,"<p>Ultrashort pulse generation hinges on the careful management of dispersion. Traditionally, this has exclusively involved second-order dispersion, with higher-order dispersion treated as a nuisance to be minimized. Here, we show that this higher-order dispersion can be strategically leveraged to access an uncharted regime of ultrafast laser operation. In particular, our mode-locked laser&#8212;with an intracavity spectral pulse shaper&#8212;emits pure-quartic soliton pulses that arise from the interaction of fourth-order dispersion and the Kerr nonlinearity. Phase-resolved measurements demonstrate that their pulse energy scales with the third power of the inverse pulse duration. This implies a strong increase in the energy of short pure-quartic solitons compared with conventional solitons, for which the energy scales as the inverse of the pulse duration. These results not only demonstrate a novel approach to ultrafast lasers, but more fundamentally, they clarify the use of higher-order dispersion for optical pulse control, enabling innovations in nonlinear optics and its applications.</p>",,[],False,"[""Antoine F.

article,High-purity orbital angular momentum states from a visible metasurface laser,"<p>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) from lasers holds promise for compact, at-source solutions for applications ranging from imaging to communications. However, conjugate symmetry between circular spin and opposite helicity OAM states (&#177;&#8467;) from conventional spin&#8211;orbit approaches has meant that complete control of light&#8217;s angular momentum from lasers has remained elusive. Here, we report a metasurface-enhanced laser that overcomes this limitation. We demonstrate new high-purity OAM states with quantum numbers reaching &#8467;&#8201;=&#8201;100 and non-symmetric vector vortex beams that lase simultaneously on independent OAM states as much as &#916;&#8467;&#8201;=&#8201;90 apart, an extreme violation of previous symmetric spin&#8211;orbit lasing devices.

article,Exceptional polarization purity in antiresonant hollow-core optical fibres,"<p>High-performance interferometers, gyroscopes, frequency combs, quantum information experiments and optical clocks rely on the transmission of light beams with the highest possible spatial and polarization purity. Free-space propagation in vacuum unlocks the ultimate performance but becomes impractical at even modest length scales. Glass optical fibres offer a more pragmatic alternative, but degrade polarization purity and suffer from detrimental nonlinear effects. Hollow-core fibres have been heralded for years as the ideal compromise between the two, but achieving high modal purity in both spatial and polarization domains has proved elusive thus far. Here, we show that carefully designed, low-nonlinearity hollow-core antiresonant fibres can transmit a single pair of orthogonal polarization modes with cross-coupling on the scale of 10<sup>&#8211;</sup><sup>10</sup>&#8201;m<sup>&#8211;</sup><sup>1</sup>; that is, orders of magnitude lower than any other solution.

article,Fluorescence imaging through dynamic scattering media with speckle-encoded ultrasound-modulated light correlation,"<p>Fluorescence imaging is indispensable to biomedical research, and yet it remains challenging to image through dynamic scattering samples. Techniques that combine ultrasound and light as exemplified by ultrasound-assisted wavefront shaping have enabled fluorescence imaging through scattering media. However, the translation of these techniques into in vivo applications has been hindered by the lack of high-speed solutions to counter the fast speckle decorrelation of dynamic tissue. Here, we report an ultrasound-enabled optical imaging method that instead leverages the dynamic nature to perform imaging. The method utilizes the correlation between the dynamic speckle-encoded fluorescence and ultrasound-modulated light signal that originate from the same location within a sample. We image fluorescent targets with an improved resolution of &#8804;75&#8201;&#181;m (versus a resolution of 1.3&#8201;mm with direct optical imaging) within a scattering medium with 17&#8201;ms decorrelation time.

article,Dynamics of the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition in a photon fluid,"<p>In addition to enhancing confinement, restricting optical systems to two dimensions gives rise to new photonic states, modified transport and distinct nonlinear effects. Here we explore these properties in combination and experimentally demonstrate a Berezinskii&#8211;Kosterlitz&#8211;Thouless phase transition in a nonlinear photonic lattice. In this topological transition, vortices are created in pairs and then unbind, changing the dynamics from that of a photonic fluid to that of a plasma-like gas of free (topological) charges. We explicitly measure the number and correlation properties of free vortices, for both repulsive and attractive interactions (the photonic equivalent of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic conditions), and confirm the traditional thermodynamics of the Berezinskii&#8211;Kosterlitz&#8211;Thouless transition. We also suggest a purely fluid interpretation, in which vortices are nucleated by inhomogeneous flow and driven by seeded instability. The results are fundamental to optical hydrodynamics and can impact two-dimensional photonic devices if temperature and interactions are not controlled properly.</p>",,[],False,"[""Guohai Situ"", ""Jason W.
