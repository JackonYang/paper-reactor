review article,Variable optical elements for fast focus control,"<p>In this Review, we survey recent developments in the emerging field of high-speed variable-z-focus optical elements, which are driving important innovations in advanced imaging and materials processing applications. Three-dimensional biomedical imaging, high-throughput industrial inspection, advanced spectroscopies, and other optical characterization and materials modification methods have made great strides forward in recent years due to precise and rapid axial control of light. Three state-of-the-art key optical technologies that enable fast z-focus modulation are reviewed, along with a discussion of the implications of the new developments in variable optical elements and their impact on technologically relevant applications.</p>",,[],False,"[""SeungYeon Kang"", ""Mart\u00ed Duocastella"", ""Craig B.

letter,Unidirectional luminescence from InGaN/GaN quantum-well metasurfaces,"<p>III&#8211;nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are the backbone of ubiquitous lighting and display applications. Imparting directional emission is an essential requirement for many LED implementations. Although optical packaging, nanopatterning and surface roughening techniques can enhance LED extraction, directing the emitted light requires bulky optical components. Optical metasurfaces provide precise control over transmitted and reflected waveforms, suggesting a new route for directing light emission. However, it is difficult to adapt metasurface concepts for incoherent light emission, due to the lack of a phase-locking incident wave. Here, we demonstrate a metasurface-based design of InGaN/GaN quantum-well structures that generate narrow, unidirectional transmission and emission lobes at arbitrary engineered angles. We further demonstrate 7-fold and 100-fold enhancements of total and air-coupled external quantum efficiencies, respectively. The results present a new strategy for exploiting metasurface functionality in light-emitting devices.</p>",,[],False,"[""Prasad P. Iyer"", ""Ryan A.

letter,Strong mid-infrared photoresponse in small-twist-angle bilayer graphene,"<p>Small-twist-angle (&lt;2&#176;) bilayer graphene has received extraordinary attention recently due to its exciting physical properties. Compared with monolayer graphene, the Brillouin zone folding in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) leads to the formation of a superlattice bandgap and substantial modification to the density of states. However, these emerging properties have rarely been leveraged to realize new optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate the strong, gate-tunable photoresponse in the mid-infrared wavelength range of 5 to 12&#8201;&#956;m. A maximum extrinsic photoresponsivity of 26&#8201;mA&#8201;W<sup>&#8722;1</sup> has been achieved at 12&#8201;&#956;m when the Fermi level in 1.81&#176; TBG was tuned to its superlattice bandgap. Moreover, the strong photoresponse critically depends on the formation of a superlattice bandgap, and it vanishes in the gapless case with an ultrasmall twist angle (&lt;0.5&#176;). Our demonstration reveals the promising optical properties of TBG and provides an alternative material platform for tunable mid-infrared optoelectronics.</p>",,[],False,"[""Bingchen Deng"", ""Chao Ma"", ""Qiyue Wang"", ""Shaofan Yuan"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Fan Zhang"", ""Fengnian Xia""]","Deng, B., Ma, C., Wang, Q. et al.

letter,Photoelectric effect with a twist,"<p>Photons have fixed spin and unbounded orbital angular momentum (OAM). While the former is manifested in the polarization of light, the latter corresponds to the spatial phase distribution of its wavefront. The distinctive way in which the photon spin dictates the electron motion upon light&#8211;matter interaction is the basis for numerous well-established spectroscopies. By contrast, imprinting OAM on a matter wave, specifically on a propagating electron, is generally considered very challenging and the anticipated effect undetectable. In refs. , the authors provided evidence of OAM-dependent absorption of light by a bound electron. Here, we seek to observe an OAM-dependent dichroic photoelectric effect, using a sample of He atoms. Surprisingly, we find that the OAM of an optical field can be imprinted coherently onto a propagating electron wave. Our results reveal new aspects of light&#8211;matter interaction and point to a new kind of single-photon electron spectroscopy.</p>",,[],False,"[""Giovanni De Ninno"", ""Jonas W\u00e4tzel"", ""Primo\u017e Rebernik Ribi\u010d"", ""Enrico Allaria"", ""Marcello Coreno"", ""Miltcho B.

article,Harmonic optical tomography of nonlinear structures,"<p>Second-harmonic generation microscopy is a valuable label-free modality for imaging non-centrosymmetric structures and has important biomedical applications from live-cell imaging to cancer diagnosis. Conventional second-harmonic generation microscopy measures intensity signals that originate from tightly focused laser beams, preventing researchers from solving the scattering inverse problem for second-order nonlinear materials. Here, we present harmonic optical tomography (HOT) as a novel modality for imaging microscopic, nonlinear and inhomogeneous objects. The HOT principle of operation relies on interferometrically measuring the complex harmonic field and using a scattering inverse model to reconstruct the three-dimensional distribution of harmonophores. HOT enables strong axial sectioning via the momentum conservation of spatially and temporally broadband fields. We illustrate the HOT operation with experiments and reconstructions on a beta-barium borate crystal and various biological specimens. Although our results involve second-order nonlinear materials, we show that this approach applies to any coherent nonlinear process.</p>",,[],False,"[""Chenfei Hu"", ""Jeffrey J.

article,Overcoming the energy gap law in near-infrared OLEDs by exciton–vibration decoupling,"<p>The development of high-performance near-infrared organic light-emitting diodes is hindered by strong non-radiative processes as governed by the energy gap law. Here, we show that exciton delocalization, which serves to decouple the exciton band from highly vibrational ladders in the S<sub>0</sub> ground state, can bring substantial enhancements in the photoluminescence quantum yield of emitters, bypassing the energy gap law. Experimental proof is provided by the design and synthesis of a series of new Pt(ii) complexes with a delocalization length of 5&#8211;9 molecules that emit at 866&#8211;960&#8201;nm with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 5&#8211;12% in solid films. The corresponding near-infrared organic light-emitting diodes emit light with a 930&#8201;nm peak wavelength and a high external quantum efficiency up to 2.14% and a radiance of 41.6&#8201;W&#8201;sr<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>.

article,Strain-engineered high-responsivity MoTe2 photodetector for silicon photonic integrated circuits,"<p>In integrated photonics, specific wavelengths such as 1,550&#8201;nm are preferred due to low-loss transmission and the availability of optical gain in this spectral region. For chip-based photodetectors, two-dimensional materials bear scientifically and technologically relevant properties such as electrostatic tunability and strong light&#8211;matter interactions. However, no efficient photodetector in the telecommunication C-band has been realized with two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials due to their large optical bandgaps. Here we demonstrate a MoTe<sub>2</sub>-based photodetector featuring a strong photoresponse (responsivity 0.5&#8201;A&#8201;W<sup>&#8211;1</sup>) operating at 1,550&#8201;nm in silicon photonics enabled by strain engineering the two-dimensional material. Non-planarized waveguide structures show a bandgap modulation of 0.2&#8201;eV, resulting in a large photoresponse in an otherwise photoinactive medium when unstrained. Unlike graphene-based photodetectors that rely on a gapless band structure, this photodetector shows an approximately 100-fold reduction in dark current, enabling an efficient noise-equivalent power of 90&#8201;pW&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8211;</sup><sup>0.5</sup>.

article,Photochemical upconversion of near-infrared light from below the silicon bandgap,"<p>Photochemical upconversion is a strategy for converting infrared light into more energetic, visible light, with potential applications ranging from biological imaging and drug delivery to photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Although systems have been developed for upconverting light from photon energies in the near-infrared, upconversion from below the silicon bandgap has been out of reach. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion composition using PbS semiconductor nanocrystal sensitizers that absorb photons below the bandgap of silicon and populate violanthrone triplet states below the singlet oxygen energy. The triplet-state violanthrone chromophores luminesce in the visible spectrum following energy delivery from two singlet oxygen molecules. By incorporating organic chromophores as ligands onto the PbS nanocrystals to improve energy transfer, we demonstrate that violanthrone upconverts in the absence of oxygen by the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation mechanism.
