letter,Harmonic spin–orbit angular momentum cascade in nonlinear optical crystals,"<p>Optical angular momentum-based photonic technologies demonstrate the key role of the optical spin&#8211;orbit interaction that usually refers to linear optical processes in spatially engineered optical materials. Re-examining the basics of nonlinear optics of homogeneous crystals under circularly polarized light, we report experiments on the enrichment of the spin&#8211;orbit angular momentum spectrum of paraxial light. The demonstration is made within the framework of second-harmonic generation using a crystal with three-fold rotational symmetry. Four spin&#8211;orbit optical states for the second harmonic field are predicted from a single fundamental state owing to the interplay between linear spin&#8211;orbit coupling and nonlinear wave mixing; three of these states are experimentally verified. Besides representing a spin-controlled nonlinear route to orbital angular multiplexing, modal vortex light sources, high-dimensional parametric processes and multi-state optical magnetization, our findings suggest that the fundamentals of nonlinear optics are worth revisiting through the prism of the spin&#8211;orbit interaction of light.</p>",,[],False,"[""Yutao Tang"", ""Kingfai Li"", ""Xuecai Zhang"", ""Junhong Deng"", ""Guixin Li"", ""Etienne Brasselet""]","Tang, Y., Li, K., Zhang, X. et al.

letter,Optical soliton formation controlled by angle twisting in photonic moiré lattices,"<p>Exploration of the impact of synthetic material landscapes featuring tunable geometrical properties on physical processes is a research direction that is currently of great interest because of the outstanding phenomena that are continually being uncovered. Twistronics and the properties of wave excitations in moir&#233; lattices are salient examples. Moir&#233; patterns bridge the gap between aperiodic structures and perfect crystals, thus opening the door to the exploration of effects accompanying the transition from commensurate to incommensurate phases. Moir&#233; patterns have revealed profound effects in graphene-based systems, they are used to manipulate ultracold atoms and to create gauge potentials, and are observed in colloidal clusters. Recently, it was shown that photonic moir&#233; lattices enable observation of the two-dimensional localization-to-delocalization transition of light in purely linear systems. Here, we employ moir&#233; lattices optically induced in photorefractive nonlinear media to elucidate the formation of optical solitons under different geometrical conditions controlled by the twisting angle between the constitutive sublattices. We observe the formation of solitons in lattices that smoothly transition from fully periodic geometries to aperiodic ones, with threshold properties that are a pristine direct manifestation of flat-band physics.</p>",,[],False,"[""Qidong Fu"", ""Peng Wang"", ""Changming Huang"", ""Yaroslav V.

article,Tunable pseudo-magnetic fields for polaritons in strained metasurfaces,"<p>Pseudo-magnetic fields generated in artificially strained lattices have enabled the emulation of exotic phenomena once thought to be exclusive to charged particles. However, they have so far failed to emulate the tunability of real magnetic fields because they are determined solely by the engineered strain configuration, rendering them fixed by design. Here, we unveil a universal mechanism to tune pseudo-magnetic fields for polaritons supported by a strained honeycomb metasurface composed of interacting dipole emitters/antennas. Without altering the strain configuration, we show that the pseudo-magnetic field strength can be tuned by modifying the surrounding electromagnetic environment via an enclosing cavity waveguide, which modifies the nature of the dipole&#8211;dipole interactions. Owing to the competition between short-range Coulomb interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions, the pseudo-magnetic field can be entirely switched off at a critical cavity width, without removing the strain. Consequently, by varying only the cavity width, we demonstrate a tunable Lorentz-like force that can be switched on/off and a collapse and revival of polariton Landau levels. Unlocking this tunable pseudo-magnetism poses new intriguing questions beyond the paradigm of conventional tight-binding physics.</p>",,[],False,"[""Charlie-Ray Mann"", ""Simon A. R.

article,Non-adiabatic stripping of a cavity field from electrons in the deep-strong coupling regime,"<p>Atomically strong light pulses can drive sub-optical-cycle dynamics. When the Rabi frequency&#8212;the rate of energy exchange between light and matter&#8212;exceeds the optical carrier frequency, fascinating non-perturbative strong-field phenomena emerge, such as high-harmonic generation and lightwave transport. Here, we explore a related novel subcycle regime of ultimately strong light&#8211;matter interaction without a coherent driving field. We use the vacuum fluctuations of nanoantennas to drive cyclotron resonances of two-dimensional electron gases to vacuum Rabi frequencies exceeding the carrier frequency. Femtosecond photoactivation of a switch element inside the cavity disrupts this &#8216;deep-strong coupling&#8217; more than an order of magnitude faster than the oscillation cycle of light. The abrupt modification of the vacuum ground state causes spectrally broadband polarization oscillations confirmed by our quantum model. In the future, this subcycle shaping of hybrid quantum states may trigger cavity-induced quantum chemistry, vacuum-modified transport or cavity-controlled superconductivity, opening new scenarios for non-adiabatic quantum optics.</p>",,[],False,"[""M.

article,Vectorized optoelectronic control and metrology in a semiconductor,"<p>The increasingly prominent role of light in information processing makes optoelectronic devices a technology of fundamental importance. Coherent control of currents in semiconductors using synthesized optical waveforms provides a sensitive and robust means to transfer information from light to an electronic circuit. Currents driven by Gaussian laser beams are spatially uniform in direction, offering limited technological utility. Full control over the transverse spatial distribution of currents excited in a material would vastly increase the versatility and impact of optoelectronic devices. Here we simultaneously control the waveform and vectorial arrangement of optical fields, enabling precise manipulation of the spatial distribution of currents in a semiconductor. As a direct application, we drive loop currents, embodying a new ultrafast magnetic field source. Subsequently, we demonstrate a scheme for generating an arbitrary superposition of two orthogonal current arrangements via subcycle adjustment of the optical waveform.</p>",,[],False,"[""Shawn Sederberg"", ""Fanqi Kong"", ""Felix Hufnagel"", ""Chunmei Zhang"", ""Ebrahim Karimi"", ""Paul B.

article,Tunable free-electron X-ray radiation from van der Waals materials,"<p>Tunable sources of X-ray radiation are widely used for imaging and spectroscopy in fundamental science, medicine and industry. The growing demand for highly tunable, high-brightness laboratory-scale X-ray sources motivates research into new fundamental mechanisms of X-ray generation. Here, we demonstrate the ability of van der Waals materials to serve as a platform for tunable X-ray generation when irradiated by moderately relativistic electrons available, for example, from a transmission electron microscope. The radiation spectrum can be precisely controlled by tuning the acceleration voltage of the incident electrons, as well as by our proposed approach: adjusting the lattice structure of the van der Waals material.

article,Sub-nanometre resolution in single-molecule photoluminescence imaging,"<p>Ambitions to reach atomic resolution with light have been a major force in shaping nano-optics, whereby a central challenge is achieving highly localized optical fields. A promising approach employs plasmonic nanoantennas, but fluorescence quenching in the vicinity of metallic structures often imposes a strict limit on the attainable spatial resolution, and previous studies have reached only 8&#8201;nm resolution in fluorescence mapping. Here, we demonstrate spatially and spectrally resolved photoluminescence imaging of a single phthalocyanine molecule coupled to nanocavity plasmons in a tunnelling junction with a spatial resolution down to &#8764;8&#8201;&#197; and locally map the molecular exciton energy and linewidth at sub-molecular resolution. This remarkable resolution is achieved through an exquisite nanocavity control, including tip-apex engineering with an atomistic protrusion, quenching management through emitter&#8211;metal decoupling and sub-nanometre positioning precision.

article,Intense Brillouin amplification in gas using hollow-core waveguides,"<p>Among all the nonlinear effects stimulated Brillouin scattering offers the highest gain in solid materials and has demonstrated advanced photonics functionalities in waveguides. The large compressibility of gases suggests that stimulated Brillouin scattering may gain in efficiency with respect to condensed materials. Here, by using a gas-filled hollow-core fibre at high pressure, we achieve a strong Brillouin amplification per unit length, exceeding by six times the gain observed in fibres with a solid silica core. This large amplification benefits from a higher molecular density and a lower acoustic attenuation at higher pressure, combined with a tight light confinement. Using this approach, we demonstrate the capability to perform large optical amplifications in hollow-core waveguides. The implementations of a low-threshold gas Brillouin fibre laser and a high-performance distributed temperature sensor, intrinsically free of strain cross-sensitivity, illustrate the potential for hollow-core fibres, paving the way to their integration into lasing, sensing and signal processing.</p>",,[],False,"[""Fan Yang"", ""Flavien Gyger"", ""Luc Th\u00e9venaz""]","Yang, F., Gyger, F. & Thévenaz, L.
