letter,Correlating photons using the collective nonlinear response of atoms weakly coupled to an optical mode,"<p>Photons in a nonlinear medium can repel or attract each other, resulting in strongly correlated quantum many-body states. Typically, such correlated states of light arise from the extreme nonlinearity granted by quantum emitters that are strongly coupled to a photonic mode. However, unavoidable dissipation (such as photon loss) blurs nonlinear quantum effects when such approaches are used. Here, we generate strongly correlated photon states using only weak coupling and taking advantage of dissipation. An ensemble of non-interacting waveguide-coupled atoms induces correlations between simultaneously arriving photons through collectively enhanced nonlinear interactions. These correlated photons experience less dissipation than the uncorrelated ones. Depending on the number of atoms, we experimentally observe strong photon bunching or antibunching of the transmitted light. This realization of a collectively enhanced nonlinearity may turn out to be transformational for quantum information science and opens new avenues for generating non-classical light, covering frequencies from the microwave to the X-ray regime.</p>",[],False,"[""Adarsh S.

letter,Transient optical symmetry breaking for ultrafast broadband dichroism in plasmonic metasurfaces,"<p>Ultrafast nanophotonics is an emerging research field aimed at the development of nanodevices capable of light modulation with unprecedented speed. A promising approach exploits the optical nonlinearity of nanostructured materials (either metallic or dielectric) to modulate their effective permittivity via interaction with intense ultrashort laser pulses. Although the ultrafast temporal dynamics of such nanostructures following photoexcitation has been studied in depth, sub-picosecond transient spatial inhomogeneities taking place at the nanoscale have been overlooked so far. Here, we demonstrate that the inhomogeneous spacetime distribution of photogenerated hot carriers induces a transient symmetry breaking in a highly symmetric plasmonic metasurface. The process is fully reversible and results in a broadband transient dichroism with a recovery of the initial isotropic state in less than 1&#8201;ps, overcoming the speed bottleneck caused by slower (electron&#8211;phonon and phonon&#8211;phonon) relaxation processes. Our results pave the way to ultrafast dichroic devices for high-speed modulation of light polarization.</p>",[],True,"[""Andrea Schirato"", ""Margherita Maiuri"", ""Andrea Toma"", ""Silvio Fugattini"", ""Remo Proietti Zaccaria"", ""Paolo Laporta"", ""Peter Nordlander"", ""Giulio Cerullo"", ""Alessandro Alabastri"", ""Giuseppe Della Valle""]","Schirato, A., Maiuri, M., Toma, A. et al.

letter,Lightwave control of topological properties in 2D materials for sub-cycle and non-resonant valley manipulation,"<p>Modern light generation technology offers extraordinary capabilities for sculpting light pulses, with full control over individual electric field oscillations within each laser cycle. These capabilities are at the core of lightwave electronics&#8212;the dream of ultrafast lightwave control over electron dynamics in solids on a sub-cycle timescale, aiming at information processing at petahertz rates. Here, bringing the frequency-domain concept of topological Floquet systems to the few-femtosecond time domain, we develop a theoretical method that can be implemented with existing technology, to control the topological properties of two-dimensional materials on few-femtosecond timescales by controlling the sub-cycle structure of non-resonant driving fields. We use this method to propose an all-optical, non-element-specific technique, physically transparent in real space, to coherently write, manipulate and read selective valley excitation using fields carried in a wide range of frequencies and on timescales that are orders of magnitude shorter than the valley lifetime, crucial for the implementation of valleytronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""\u00c1.

article,High-energy multidimensional solitary states in hollow-core fibres,"<p>Multidimensional solitary states (MDSS)&#8212;self-sustained wavepackets&#8212;have attracted renewed interest in many different fields of physics. They are of particular importance in nonlinear optics, especially for the nonlinear propagation of ultrashort pulses in multimode fibres, which contain rich spatiotemporal intermodal interactions and dynamics, albeit often in an unstable manner. Here, we report the observation of the formation of highly stable multidimensional solitary states in a molecular gas-filled large-core hollow-core fibre. We experimentally and numerically demonstrate the creation of MDSS by multimillijoule, subpicosecond near-infrared pulses and the underlying physics. We find that the MDSS have a broadband redshifted spectra with an uncommon negative quadratic spectral phase at the output of the hollow-core fibre, originating from Raman enhancement due to the strong intermodal nonlinear interactions. The spatial and temporal localization of MDSS enables the compression of the broadened pulses at the output to 10.8&#8201;fs by simple linear propagation in a piece of fused silica. The high spatiotemporal quality of MDSS is further verified by high-harmonic generation. Our results present new opportunities for studying multimodal spatiotemporal dynamics in the high-energy regime. This work also presents a route toward a new class of compact, tunable and high-energy spatiotemporally engineered coherent light sources based on picosecond ytterbium technology.</p>",[],False,"[""Reza Safaei"", ""Guangyu Fan"", ""Ojoon Kwon"", ""Katherine L\u00e9gar\u00e9"", ""Philippe Lassonde"", ""Bruno E.

article,Broadband Mie driven random quasi-phase-matching,"<p>High-quality crystals without inversion symmetry are the conventional platform to achieve optical frequency conversion via three-wave mixing. In bulk crystals, efficient wave mixing relies on phase-matching configurations, while at the micro- and nanoscale it requires resonant mechanisms that enhance the nonlinear light&#8211;matter interaction. These strategies commonly result in wavelength-specific performances and narrowband applications. Disordered photonic materials, made up of a random assembly of optical nonlinear crystals, enable a broadband tunability in the random quasi-phase-matching regime and do not require high-quality materials. Here, we combine resonances and disorder by implementing random quasi-phase-matching in Mie resonant spheres of a few micrometres realized by the bottom-up assembly of barium titanate nanocrystals. The measured second-harmonic generation reveals a combination of broadband and resonant wave mixing, in which Mie resonances drive and enhance the second-harmonic generation, while the disorder keeps the phase-matching conditions relaxed. Our nanocrystal assemblies provide new opportunities for tailored phase matching at the microscale, beyond the coherence length of the bulk crystal. They can be adapted to achieve frequency conversion from the near-ultraviolet to the infrared ranges, are low cost and can cover large surface areas.</p>",[],False,"[""Romolo Savo"", ""Andrea Morandi"", ""Jolanda S.

SwissFEL is a very stable, compact and cost-effective X-ray FEL facility driven by a low-energy and ultra-low-emittance electron beam travelling through short-period undulators. It delivers stable hard X-ray FEL radiation at 1-&#197; wavelength with pulse energies of more than 500&#8201;&#956;J, pulse durations of ~30&#8201;fs (root mean square) and spectral bandwidth below the per-mil level. Using special configurations, we have produced pulses shorter than 1 fs and, in a different set-up, broadband radiation with an unprecedented bandwidth of ~2%. The extremely small emittance demonstrated at SwissFEL paves the way for even more compact and affordable hard X-ray FELs, potentially boosting the number of facilities worldwide and thereby expanding the population of the scientific community that has access to X-ray FEL radiation.</p>",[],False,"[""Eduard Prat"", ""Rafael Abela"", ""Masamitsu Aiba"", ""Arturo Alarcon"", ""J\u00fcrgen Alex"", ""Yunieski Arbelo"", ""Christopher Arrell"", ""Vladimir Arsov"", ""Camila Bacellar"", ""Carl Beard"", ""Paul Beaud"", ""Simona Bettoni"", ""Roger Biffiger"", ""Markus Bopp"", ""Hans-Heinrich Braun"", ""Marco Calvi"", ""Ariana Cassar"", ""Tine Celcer"", ""Majed Chergui"", ""Pavel Chevtsov"", ""Claudio Cirelli"", ""Alessandro Citterio"", ""Paolo Craievich"", ""Marta Csatari Divall"", ""Andreas Dax"", ""Micha Dehler"", ""Yunpei Deng"", ""Alexander Dietrich"", ""Philipp Dijkstal"", ""Roberto Dinapoli"", ""Sladana Dordevic"", ""Simon Ebner"", ""Daniel Engeler"", ""Christian Erny"", ""Vincent Esposito"", ""Eugenio Ferrari"", ""Uwe Flechsig"", ""Rolf Follath"", ""Franziska Frei"", ""Romain Ganter"", ""Terence Garvey"", ""Zheqiao Geng"", ""Alexandre Gobbo"", ""Christopher Gough"", ""Andreas Hauff"", ""Christoph P.

article,NIR II-responsive photon upconversion through energy migration in an ytterbium sublattice,"<p>Smart control of photon upconversion is a key strategy for lanthanide-based materials used in biological and photonic applications.

Here, we report a conceptual design for an energy-migratory ytterbium sublattice in an erbium-sensitized multilayer core&#8211;shell nanostructure that is able to achieve photon upconversion from a broad range of lanthanide ions (Yb<sup>3+</sup>, Tm<sup>3+</sup>, Ho<sup>3+</sup>, Gd<sup>3+</sup>, Eu<sup>3+</sup> and Tb<sup>3+</sup>) under 1,530&#8201;nm irradiation. The quasi-single-band upconversion in the first near-infrared (NIR I) biowindow is also realized through fine manipulation of the introduced cross-relaxations.
