letter,Optical parametric amplification by monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides,"<p>Optical parametric amplification is a second-order nonlinear process whereby an optical signal is amplified by a pump via the generation of an idler field. This mechanism is inherently related to spontaneous parametric down-conversion, which currently constitutes the building block for entangled photon pair generation, a process that is exploited in modern quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate single-pass optical parametric amplification at the ultimate thickness limit; using semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, we show that amplification can be attained over propagation through a single atomic layer. Such a second-order nonlinear interaction at the two-dimensional limit bypasses phase-matching requirements and achieves ultrabroad amplification bandwidths. In agreement with first-principle calculations, we observe that the amplification process is independent of the in-plane polarization of signal and pump fields. By the use of AA-stacked multilayers, we present a clear pathway towards the scaling of conversion efficiency. Our results pave the way for the development of atom-sized tunable sources of radiation with potential applications in nanophotonics and quantum information technology.</p>",[],False,"[""Chiara Trovatello"", ""Andrea Marini"", ""Xinyi Xu"", ""Changhwan Lee"", ""Fang Liu"", ""Nicola Curreli"", ""Cristian Manzoni"", ""Stefano Dal Conte"", ""Kaiyuan Yao"", ""Alessandro Ciattoni"", ""James Hone"", ""Xiaoyang Zhu"", ""P.

article,Silicon photonics interfaced with integrated electronics for 9 GHz measurement of squeezed light,"<p>Photonic quantum technology can be enhanced by monolithic fabrication of both the underpinning quantum hardware and the corresponding electronics for classical readout and control. Here, by interfacing complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon and germanium-on-silicon nanophotonics with silicon-germanium integrated amplification electronics, we curtail total capacitance in a homodyne detector to enhance the speed performance of quantum light measurement.

We show that the detector can measure the continuous spectrum of squeezing from 100&#8201;MHz to 9&#8201;GHz of a broadband squeezed light source pumped with a continuous-wave laser, and we use the detector to perform state tomography.

article,High-power portable terahertz laser systems,"<p>Terahertz (THz) frequencies remain among the least utilized in the electromagnetic spectrum, largely due to the lack of powerful and compact sources. The invention of THz quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) was a major breakthrough to bridge the so-called &#8216;THz gap&#8217; between semiconductor electronic and photonic sources. However, their demanding cooling requirement has confined the technology to a laboratory environment. A portable and high-power THz laser system will have a qualitative impact on applications in medical imaging, communications, quality control, security and biochemistry. Here, by adopting a design strategy that achieves a clean three-level system, we have developed THz QCLs (at ~4&#8201;THz) with a maximum operating temperature of 250&#8201;K. The high operating temperature enables portable THz systems to perform real-time imaging with a room-temperature THz camera, as well as fast spectral measurements with a room-temperature detector.</p>",[],False,"[""Ali Khalatpour"", ""Andrew K.

article,Pockels soliton microcomb,"<p>Kerr soliton microcombs have recently emerged as a prominent topic in integrated photonics and have enabled new horizons for optical frequency metrology. Kerr soliton microcombs, as the name suggests, are based on high-order cubic optical nonlinearity. It is desirable to exploit quadratic photonic materials, namely Pockels materials, for soliton generation and on-chip implementation of 1f&#8211;2f comb self-referencing. Such quadratically driven solitons have been proposed theoretically, but have not yet been observed in a nanophotonic platform, despite recent progress in quadratic comb generation in free-space and crystalline resonators. Here, we report photonic-chip-based Pockels microcomb solitons driven by three-wave mixing in an aluminium nitride microring resonator. In contrast to typical Kerr solitons, the Pockels soliton features unity soliton generation fidelity, two-by-two evolution of multi-soliton states, favourable tuning dynamics and high pump-to-soliton conversion efficiency.</p>",[],False,"[""Alexander W.

article,Directly modulated membrane lasers with 108 GHz bandwidth on a high-thermal-conductivity silicon carbide substrate,"<p>Increasing the modulation speed of semiconductor lasers has attracted much attention from the viewpoint of both physics and the applications of lasers. Here we propose a membrane distributed reflector laser on a low-refractive-index and high-thermal-conductivity silicon carbide substrate that overcomes the modulation bandwidth limit. The laser features a high modulation efficiency because of its large optical confinement in the active region and small differential gain reduction at a high injection current density. We achieve a 42&#8201;GHz relaxation oscillation frequency by using a laser with a 50-&#956;m-long active region. The cavity, designed to have a short photon lifetime, suppresses the damping effect while keeping the threshold carrier density low, resulting in a 60&#8201;GHz intrinsic 3&#8201;dB bandwidth (f<sub>3dB</sub>). By employing the photon&#8211;photon resonance at 95&#8201;GHz due to optical feedback from an integrated output waveguide, we achieve an f<sub>3dB</sub> of 108&#8201;GHz and demonstrate 256&#8201;Gbit&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> four-level pulse-amplitude modulations with a 475&#8201;fJ&#8201;bit<sup>&#8722;1</sup> energy cost of the direct-current electrical input.</p>",[],False,"[""Suguru Yamaoka"", ""Nikolaos-Panteleimon Diamantopoulos"", ""Hidetaka Nishi"", ""Ryo Nakao"", ""Takuro Fujii"", ""Koji Takeda"", ""Tatsurou Hiraki"", ""Takuma Tsurugaya"", ""Shigeru Kanazawa"", ""Hiromasa Tanobe"", ""Takaaki Kakitsuka"", ""Tai Tsuchizawa"", ""Fumio Koyama"", ""Shinji Matsuo""]","Yamaoka, S., Diamantopoulos, NP., Nishi, H. et al.

article,Electrically driven acousto-optics and broadband non-reciprocity in silicon photonics,"<p>Emerging technologies based on tailorable photon&#8211;phonon interactions promise new capabilities ranging from high-fidelity information processing to non-reciprocal optics and quantum state control. However, many existing realizations of such light&#8211;sound couplings involve unconventional materials and fabrication schemes challenging to co-implement with scalable integrated photonic circuitry. Here, we demonstrate direct acousto-optic modulation within silicon waveguides using electrically driven surface acoustic waves (SAWs). By co-integrating electromechanical SAW transducers with a standard silicon-on-insulator photonic platform, we harness silicon&#8217;s strong elasto-optic effect to create travelling-wave phase and single-sideband amplitude modulators from 1 to 5&#8201;GHz, with index modulation strengths comparable to electro-optic technologies. Extending this non-local interaction to centimetre scales, we demonstrate non-reciprocal modulation with operation bandwidths of &gt;100&#8201;GHz and insertion losses of &lt;0.6&#8201;dB. This acousto-optic platform is compatible with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor fabrication processes and existing silicon photonic device architectures, opening the door to flexible, low-loss modulators and non-magnetic optical isolators and circulators in integrated photonic circuits.</p>",[],False,"[""Eric A.

Because the confinement results from Bragg scattering, the optical cavity contains a few modes, approximately equispaced in frequency. Parametric oscillation is reached when these high-quality-factor modes are thermally tuned into a triply resonant configuration, whereas any other parametric interaction is strongly suppressed. The lowest pump power threshold is estimated to be 50&#8211;70&#8201;&#956;W.

article,Low-chirp isolator-free 65-GHz-bandwidth directly modulated lasers,"<p>Today, in the face of ever increasing communication traffic, minimizing power consumption in data communication systems has become a challenge. Direct modulation of lasers, a technique as old as lasers themselves, is known for its high energy efficiency and low cost. However, the modulation bandwidth of directly modulated lasers has fallen behind those of external modulators. In this Article, we report wide bandwidths of 65&#8211;75&#8201;GHz for three directly modulated laser design implementations, by exploiting three bandwidth enhancement effects: detuned loading, photon&#8211;photon resonance and in-cavity frequency modulation&#8211;amplitude modulation conversion.
