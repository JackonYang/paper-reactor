review article,Photonics for artificial intelligence and neuromorphic computing,"<p>Research in photonic computing has flourished due to the proliferation of optoelectronic components on photonic integration platforms. Photonic integrated circuits have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks, providing a framework for a new class of information processing machines. Algorithms running on such hardware have the potential to address the growing demand for machine learning and artificial intelligence in areas such as medical diagnosis, telecommunications, and high-performance and scientific computing. In parallel, the development of neuromorphic electronics has highlighted challenges in that domain, particularly related to processor latency. Neuromorphic photonics offers sub-nanosecond latencies, providing a complementary opportunity to extend the domain of artificial intelligence.

letter,Photoelectronic mapping of the spin–orbit interaction of intense light fields,"<p>The interaction between a quantum particle&#8217;s spin angular momentum and its orbital angular momentum is ubiquitous in nature. In optics, the spin&#8211;orbit optical phenomenon is closely related with the light&#8211;matter interaction and has been of great interest. With the development of laser technology, the high-power and ultrafast light sources now serve as a crucial tool in revealing the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions. A comprehensive knowledge of the spin&#8211;orbit interaction for intense light is of utmost importance. Here, we report the in situ modulation and visualization of the optical orbital-to-spin conversion in the strong-field regime. We show that, through manipulating the morphology of femtosecond cylindrical vector vortex pulses by a slit, the photon&#8217;s orbital angular momentum can be controllably transformed into spin after focusing. By employing a strong-field ionization experiment, the orbital-to-spin conversion can be imaged and measured through the photoelectron momentum distributions. Such detection and consequent control of the spin&#8211;orbit dynamics of intense laser fields has implications for controlling photoelectron holography and coherent extreme-ultraviolet radiation.</p>",[],False,"[""Yiqi Fang"", ""Meng Han"", ""Peipei Ge"", ""Zhenning Guo"", ""Xiaoyang Yu"", ""Yongkai Deng"", ""Chengyin Wu"", ""Qihuang Gong"", ""Yunquan Liu""]","Fang, Y., Han, M., Ge, P. et al.

letter,Sensitive vectorial optomechanical footprint of light in soft condensed matter,"<p>Among the properties of light that dictate its mechanical effects, polarization has held a special place since the mechanical identification of the photon spin. Nowadays, little surprise might be expected from the mechanical action of linearly polarized weakly focused (paraxial) beams on transparent and homogeneous dielectrics. Still, here we unveil vectorial optomechanical effects mediated by the material anisotropy and the longitudinal field component inherent to real-world beams. Experimentally, this is demonstrated by using an elastic anisotropic medium prone to exhibit a sensitive and reversible effect, that is, a nematic liquid crystal, and our results are generalized to vector beams. This represents an alternative to irreversible damaging approaches restricted to strongly non-paraxial fields. The reported creation of multiple self-induced lenses from a single beam also open up topology assisted all-optical information routing strategies. Moreover, our findings point out the transverse internal optical energy flows (spin and orbital) as novel triggers to tailor structured optical nonlinearities.</p>",[],False,"[""Mohamed El Ketara"", ""Hirokazu Kobayashi"", ""Etienne Brasselet""]","El Ketara, M., Kobayashi, H. & Brasselet, E.

article,Quantitative sampling of atomic-scale electromagnetic waveforms,"<p>Tailored nanostructures can confine electromagnetic waveforms in extremely sub-wavelength volumes, opening new avenues in lightwave sensing and control down to sub-molecular resolution. Atomic light&#8211;matter interaction depends critically on the absolute strength and the precise time evolution of the near field, which may be strongly influenced by quantum-mechanical effects. However, measuring atom-scale field transients has remained out of reach. Here we introduce quantitative atomic-scale waveform sampling in lightwave scanning tunnelling microscopy to resolve a tip-confined near-field transient. Our parameter-free calibration employs a single-molecule switch as an atomic-scale voltage standard. Although salient features of the far-to-near-field transfer follow classical electrodynamics, we develop a comprehensive understanding of the atomic-scale waveforms with time-dependent density functional theory. The simulations validate our calibration and confirm that single-electron tunnelling ensures minimal back-action of the measurement process on the electromagnetic fields.

article,Comprehensive defect suppression in perovskite nanocrystals for high-efficiency light-emitting diodes,"<p>Electroluminescence efficiencies of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are limited by a lack of material strategies that can both suppress the formation of defects and enhance the charge carrier confinement. Here we report a one-dopant alloying strategy that generates smaller, monodisperse colloidal particles (confining electrons and holes, and boosting radiative recombination) with fewer surface defects (reducing non-radiative recombination). Doping of guanidinium into formamidinium lead bromide PNCs yields limited bulk solubility while creating an entropy-stabilized phase in the PNCs and leading to smaller PNCs with more carrier confinement. The extra guanidinium segregates to the surface and stabilizes the undercoordinated sites. Furthermore, a surface-stabilizing 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene was applied as a bromide vacancy healing agent.

article,Transverse spinning of unpolarized light,"<p>It is well known that the spin angular momentum of light, and therefore that of photons, is directly related to their circular polarization. Naturally, for totally unpolarized light, polarization is undefined and the spin vanishes. However, for non-paraxial light, the recently discovered transverse spin component, orthogonal to the main propagation direction, is largely independent of the polarization state of the wave. Here, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that this transverse spin survives even in non-paraxial fields (for example, focused or evanescent) generated from totally unpolarized paraxial light. This counterintuitive phenomenon is closely related to the fundamental difference between the meanings of &#8216;full depolarization&#8217; for two-dimensional (2D) paraxial and 3D non-paraxial fields.
