review article,Ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices,"<p>Artificial crystals of light, consisting of hundreds of thousands of optical microtraps, are routinely created by interfering optical laser beams. These so-called optical lattices act as versatile potential landscapes to trap ultracold quantum gases of bosons and fermions. They form powerful model systems of quantum many-body systems in periodic potentials for probing nonlinear wave dynamics and strongly correlated quantum phases, building fundamental quantum gates or observing Fermi surfaces in periodic potentials.

letter,Spatial imaging of the spin Hall effect and current-induced polarization in two-dimensional electron gases,"<p>Spin&#8211;orbit coupling in semiconductors relates the spin of an electron to its momentum, and provides a pathway for electrically initializing and manipulating electron spins for applications in spintronics and spin-based quantum information processing. This coupling can be regulated with quantum confinement in semiconductor heterostructures through band-structure engineering. Here we investigate the spin Hall effect and current-induced spin polarization in a two-dimensional electron gas confined in (110) AlGaAs quantum wells using Kerr rotation microscopy. In contrast to previous measurements, the spin Hall profile shows complex structure and the current-induced spin polarization is out-of-plane. The experiments map the strong dependence of the current-induced spin polarization to the crystal axis along which the electric field is applied, reflecting the anisotropy of the spin&#8211;orbit interaction. These results reveal opportunities for tuning a spin source using quantum confinement and device engineering in non-magnetic materials.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Spintronics and Quantum Computation, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA', 'authors': ['V.

letter,Large-scale turbulent flow around a cylinder in counterflow superfluid4He (He (II)),"<p>The detailed nature of fluid flow over a cylinder is one of&#160;the fundamental topics in classical fluid dynamics as it demonstrates flow separation and vortex shedding. In superfluid helium, either He (II) or the B phase of<sup>3</sup>He, an important question has been to what extent these quantum fluids show classical fluid turbulent states. Although the existence of turbulent structures can be inferred using precise instrumentation, direct visualization of the flow field can provide unequivocal evidence of these phenomena. Here we show the existence of large turbulent structures in He (II) counterflow across a cylinder as obtained by the particle image velocimetry technique. Compared with classical fluid flow, the particle motion driven by He (II) counterflow shows macroscopic eddies downstream of the cylinder but also similar structures are observed in front of the cylinder, behaviour not seen in classical fluids. As Landau&#8217;s two-fluid model for He (II) describes counterflow as the relative motion of the superfluid and normal fluid components, the current results indicate that both components may be undergoing a kind of flow separation as they pass over the cylinder.</p>",,"[{'address': 'National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Florida State University, 1800 E.

letter,Superconductivity in the intercalated graphite compounds C6Yb and C6Ca,"<p>Low dimensionality is generally considered as a necessary ingredient for high superconducting transition temperatures. Surprisingly, perhaps, systems based on graphite have received little attention in this context. Introducing metal atoms between the carbon layers can tune the interlayer spacing and charging of the graphite host through a variety of electronic ground states. One such ground state is superconductivity, which is not present in pure graphite. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity in the intercalation compounds C<sub>6</sub>Yb and C<sub>6</sub>Ca, with transition temperatures of 6.5 and 11.5&#160;K, respectively. These critical temperatures are unprecedented in graphitic systems and have not been explained by a simple phonon mechanism for the superconductivity. This discovery has already stimulated several proposals for the superconducting mechanism that range from coupling by way&#160;of&#160;the intercalant phonons through to acoustic plasmons. It&#160;also&#160;points towards the potential of superconductivity in systems such as carbon&#160;nanotubes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London, Gower Street, London WCIE 6BT, UK', 'authors': ['Thomas E.

letter,The role of the interlayer state in the electronic structure of superconducting graphite intercalated compounds,"<p>Although not an intrinsic superconductor, graphite exhibits superconductivity when intercalated with certain dopants. Perhaps the most studied of these graphite-based superconductors are the alkali metal&#8211;graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) (ref.&#160;), of which the easiest to fabricate is C<sub>8</sub>K (ref.&#160;), with a transition temperature  (ref.&#160;). By increasing the alkali metal concentration (through high-pressure fabrication techniques), the transition temperature can be increased up to 5&#160;K in C<sub>2</sub>Na (ref.&#160;). Superconductivity in C<sub>6</sub>Yb and C<sub>6</sub>Ca with  and 11.5&#160;K, respectively, and at ambient conditions has been observed. Here we explore the architecture of the states near the Fermi level and identify characteristics of the electronic band structure generic to GICs. In addition to the expected charge transfer from the intercalant atoms to the graphene sheets, resulting from the occupation of the &#960; bands, we find that in all of those&#8212;and only those&#8212;compounds that superconduct, an interlayer state, which is well-separated from the carbon sheets, also becomes occupied. We show that the energy of the interlayer band is controlled by a combination of its occupancy and the separation between the carbon layers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Cavendish Laboratory, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3 0HE, UK', 'authors': ['Gábor Csányi', ',\xa0P.

letter,Signature of effective mass in crackling-noise asymmetry,"<p>Crackling noise is a common feature in many dynamic systems, the most familiar instance of which is the sound made by a sheet of paper when crumpled into a ball. Although seemingly random, this noise contains fundamental information about the properties of the system in which it occurs. One potential source of such information lies in the asymmetric shape of noise pulses emitted by a diverse range of noisy systems, but the cause of this asymmetry has lacked explanation. Here we show that the leftward asymmetry observed in the Barkhausen effect &#8212; the noise generated by the jerky motion of domain walls as they interact with impurities in a soft magnet&#8212;is a direct consequence of a magnetic domain wall&#8217;s negative effective mass. As well as providing a means of determining domain-wall effective mass from a magnet&#8217;s Barkhausen noise, our work suggests an inertial explanation for the origin of avalanche asymmetries in crackling-noise phenomena more generally.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica, CNR-INFM SMC, Università “La Sapienza”, P.le A.

letter,Maximum angle of stability of a wet granular pile,"<p>Anyone who has built a sandcastle recognizes that adding liquid to the sand grains increases the overall stability. However, measurements of the stability in wet granular materials often conflict with theory and with each other. The friction-based Mohr&#8211;Coulomb model distinguishes between granular friction and interparticle friction, but uses the former without providing a physical mechanism. A frictionless model for the geometric stability of dry particles on the surface of a pile is in excellent agreement with experiment. However, the same model applied to wet grains overestimates the stability and predicts no dependence on system size. Here we take a frictionless liquid-bridge model and perform a stability analysis within the pile. We reproduce our experimentally observed dependence of the stability angle on system size, particle size and surface tension. Furthermore, we account for past discrepancies in experimental reports by showing that sidewalls can significantly increase the stability of granular material.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA', 'authors': ['Sarah Nowak', '\xa0&\xa0Azadeh Samadani']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts 01610, USA', 'authors': ['Azadeh Samadani', '\xa0&\xa0Arshad Kudrolli']}]",True,"['Sarah Nowak', 'Azadeh Samadani', 'Arshad Kudrolli']","Nowak, S., Samadani, A. & Kudrolli, A.

article,Criticality in correlated quantum matter,"<p>At quantum critical points (QCPs) quantum fluctuations exist on all length scales, from microscopic to macroscopic, which, remarkably, can be observed at finite temperatures&#8212;the regime to which all experiments are necessarily confined. But how high in temperature can the effects of quantum criticality persist? That is, can physical observables be described in terms of universal scaling functions originating from the QCPs? We answer these questions by examining exact solutions of models of systems with strong electronic correlations and find that QCPs can influence physical properties at surprisingly high temperatures. As a powerful illustration of quantum criticality, we predict that the zero-temperature superfluid density, &#961;<sub>s</sub>(0), and the transition temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, of the high-temperature copper oxide superconductors are related by T<sub>c</sub>&#8733;&#961;<sub>s</sub>(0)<sup>y</sup>, where the exponent y is different at the two edges of the superconducting dome, signifying the presence of the respective QCPs.

article,Matter-wave interferometry in a double well on an atom chip,"<p>Matter-wave interference experiments enable us to study matter at its most basic, quantum level and form the basis of high-precision sensors for applications such as inertial and gravitational field sensing. Success in both of these pursuits requires the development of atom-optical elements that can manipulate matter waves at the same time as preserving their coherence and phase. Here, we present an integrated interferometer based on a simple, coherent matter-wave beam splitter constructed on an atom chip. Through the use of radio-frequency-induced adiabatic double-well potentials, we demonstrate the splitting of Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates into two clouds separated by distances ranging from 3 to 80&#160;&#956;m, enabling access to both tunnelling and isolated regimes. Moreover, by analysing the interference patterns formed by combining two clouds of ultracold atoms originating from a single condensate, we measure the deterministic phase evolution throughout the splitting process. We show that we can control the relative phase between the two fully separated samples and that our beam splitter is phase-preserving.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physikalisches Institut, Universität Heidelberg, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany', 'authors': ['T.
