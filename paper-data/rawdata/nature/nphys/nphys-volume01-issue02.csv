letter,A critical assessment of the superconducting pairing symmetry in NaxCoO2·yH2O,"<p>Na<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>&#183;yH<sub>2</sub>O must be hydrated to superconduct, and its triangular CoO<sub>2</sub> layers provide an intriguing contrast with the square CuO<sub>2</sub> layers of the high-temperature superconductors. Its superconductivity is often assumed to be unconventional in that the Cooper pairs are not in a spin singlet state with s-wave symmetry, as with conventional superconductors. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, pairs with a singlet (triplet) spin part have a corresponding even (odd) spatial part, designated as s-, p-, d- or f-wave pairing in accordance with the pair angular momentum. However, in Na<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>&#183;yH<sub>2</sub>O, experimental reports are often contradictory and solid evidence for any particular pairing state remains lacking. This has led to an unprecedented number of proposals for the pairing symmetry (perhaps the greatest number ever for a single compound), each in agreement with some subset of the available data. Here we test each of the 25 symmetry-allowed pairing states against firmly established properties of the compound. Surprisingly, this eliminates most possible pairings. The two remaining states both have f-wave symmetry, suggesting that Na<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub>&#183;yH<sub>2</sub>O may be the most exotic superconductor discovered so far. We discuss expected features of these states and suggest experiments to distinguish between them.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Code 6391, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC, 20375, USA', 'authors': ['I.

letter,Anisotropic interactions of a single spin and dark-spin spectroscopy in diamond,"<p>Experiments on single nitrogen&#8211;vacancy (N&#8211;V) centres in diamond, which include electron spin resonance, Rabi oscillations, single-shot spin readout and two-qubit operations with a nearby<sup>13</sup>C nuclear spin, show the potential of this spin system for solid-state quantum information processing. Moreover, N&#8211;V centre ensembles can have spin-coherence times exceeding 50&#160;&#956;s at room temperature. We have developed an&#160;angle-resolved magneto-photoluminescence microscope apparatus to investigate the anisotropic electron-spin interactions of single N&#8211;V centres at room temperature. We observe negative peaks in the photoluminescence as a function of both magnetic-field magnitude and angle that are explained by coherent spin precession and anisotropic relaxation at spin-level anti-crossings. In addition, precise field alignment unmasks the resonant coupling to neighbouring &#8216;dark&#8217; nitrogen spins, otherwise undetected by photoluminescence. These results demonstrate the capability of our spectroscopic technique for measuring small numbers of dark spins by means of a single bright spin under ambient conditions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Spintronics and Quantum Computation, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, 93106, USA', 'authors': ['R.

letter,Electric field control of spin transport,"<p>Spintronics aims to develop electronic devices whose resistance is controlled by the spin of the charge carriers that flow through them. This approach is illustrated by the operation of the most basic spintronic device, the spin valve, which can be formed if two ferromagnetic electrodes are separated by a thin tunnelling barrier. In most cases, its resistance is greater when the two electrodes are magnetized in opposite directions than when they are magnetized in the same direction. The relative difference in resistance, the so-called magnetoresistance, is then positive. However, if the transport of carriers inside the device is spin- or energy-dependent, the opposite can occur and the magnetoresistance is negative. The next step is to construct an analogous device to a field-effect transistor by using this effect to control spin transport and magnetoresistance with a voltage applied to a gate. In practice though, implementing such a device has proved difficult. Here, we report on a pronounced gate-field-controlled magnetoresistance response in carbon nanotubes connected by ferromagnetic leads. Both the magnitude and the sign of the magnetoresistance in the resulting devices can be tuned in a predictable manner. This opens an important route to the realization of multifunctional spintronic&#160;devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut für Physik, Universität Basel, Klingelbergstrasse 82, Basel, CH-4056, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Sangeeta Sahoo', ',\xa0Takis Kontos', ',\xa0Jürg Furer', ',\xa0Christian Hoffmann', ',\xa0Matthias Gräber', ',\xa0Audrey Cottet', '\xa0&\xa0Christian Schönenberger']}]",True,"['Sangeeta Sahoo', 'Takis Kontos', 'Jürg Furer', 'Christian Hoffmann', 'Matthias Gräber', 'Audrey Cottet', 'Christian Schönenberger']","Sahoo, S., Kontos, T., Furer, J. et al.

letter,Anomalous field-induced particle orientation in dilute mixtures of charged rod-like and spherical colloids,"<p>Charged colloids in aqueous suspension often reconfigure counter-intuitively in the presence of an external electric field. Despite decades of substantial theoretical effort, a clear understanding of such electrokinetic phenomena is only available for the electric polarization and migration of diluted spheres in low fields. The interpretation of the electric response of charged rod-like particles is far less advanced. Here we report that diluted rod-like particles suspended in a sea of smaller spherical particles having similar charge align perpendicular to the external electric field. This &#8216;anomalous&#8217; orientation, which contradicts the notion that charged rods in dilute suspensions always align parallel to external electric fields, seems to be universal in dilute mixtures of charged rod-like and spherical colloids. The dependence of the perpendicular orientation on frequency and particle charge, size and concentration indicates the presence of field-induced asymmetric crowding of spherical particles around each rod, which gives rise to asymmetric electro-osmotic flows that induce a negative torque.</p>",,"[{'address': 'DIMESAB, Università di Milano–Bicocca and CNR-INFM, via Cadore 48, 20052, Monza (MI), Italy', 'authors': ['F.

letter,Membrane disruption by optically controlled microbubble cavitation,"<p>In fluids, pressure-driven cavitation bubbles have a nonlinear response that can lead to extremely high core-energy densities during the collapse phase&#8212;a process underpinning phenomena such as sonoluminescence and plasma formation. If cavitation occurs near a rigid surface, the bubbles tend to collapse asymmetrically, often forming fast-moving liquid jets that may create localized surface damage. As encapsulated microbubbles are commonly used to improve echo generation in diagnostic ultrasound imaging, it is possible that such cavitation could also lead to jet-induced tissue damage. Certainly ultrasonic irradiation (insonation) of cells in the presence of microbubbles can lead to enhanced membrane permeabilization and molecular uptake (sonoporation), but, although the mechanism during low-intensity insonation is clear, experimental corroboration for higher pressure regimes has remained elusive. Here we show direct observational evidence that illuminates the energetic micrometre-scale interactions between individual cells and violently cavitating shelled microbubbles. Our data suggest that sonoporation at higher intensities may arise through a synergistic interplay involving several distinct processes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Surgery and Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science and Technology, Ninewells Hospital, University of Dundee, Dundee, DD1 9SY, Scotland, UK', 'authors': ['Paul Prentice', ',\xa0Alfred Cuschieri', '\xa0&\xa0Paul Campbell']}, {'address': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews, North Haugh, St Andrews KY16 9SS, Fife, Scotland, UK', 'authors': ['Kishan Dholakia']}, {'address': 'School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 311 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, Georgia, 30332-0100, USA', 'authors': ['Mark Prausnitz']}, {'address': 'Div.

article,Coherent spinor dynamics in a spin-1 Bose condensate,"<p>Collisions in a thermal gas are perceived as random or incoherent as a consequence of the large numbers of initial and final quantum states accessible to the system. In a quantum gas, for example, a Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate or a degenerate Fermi gas, the phase space accessible to low-energy collisions is so restricted that collisions become coherent and reversible. Here, we report the observation of coherent spin-changing collisions in a gas of spin-1 bosons. Starting with condensates occupying two spin states, a condensate in the third spin state is coherently and reversibly created by atomic collisions. The observed dynamics are analogous to Josephson oscillations in weakly connected superconductors and represent a type of matter&#8211;wave four-wave mixing. The spin-dependent scattering length is determined from these oscillations to be&#160;&#8722;1.45(32)&#160;bohr. Finally, we demonstrate coherent control of the evolution of the system by applying differential phase shifts to the spin states using magnetic&#160;fields.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, 30332-0430, USA', 'authors': ['Ming-Shien Chang', ',\xa0Qishu Qin', ',\xa0Wenxian Zhang', ',\xa0Li You', '\xa0&\xa0Michael S.

article,Fate of the Josephson effect in thin-film superconductors,"<p>The d.c. Josephson effect refers to the dissipationless electrical current&#8212;the supercurrent&#8212;that can be sustained across a weak link connecting two bulk superconductors. This effect probes the nature of the superconducting state, which depends crucially on spatial dimensionality. For bulk (that is, three-dimensional) superconductors, the superconductivity is most robust and the Josephson effect is sustained even at non-zero temperature. However, in wires and thin films, thermal and quantum fluctuations play a crucial role. In superconducting wires, these effects qualitatively modify the electrical transport across a weak link. Despite several experiments involving weak links between thin-film superconductors, little theoretical attention has been paid to the electrical conduction in such systems. Here, we analyse the case of two superconducting thin films connected by a point contact. Remarkably, the Josephson effect is absent at non-zero temperature. The point-contact resistance is non-zero and varies with temperature in a nearly activated fashion, with a universal energy barrier set by the superfluid stiffness characterizing the films. This behaviour reflects the subtle nature of thin-film superconductors and should be observable in future experiments.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, 93106, USA', 'authors': ['Michael Hermele']}, {'address': 'Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California, 93106, USA', 'authors': ['Gil Refael', '\xa0&\xa0Matthew P.

article,Vacuum-stimulated cooling of single atoms in three dimensions,"<p>Controlling quantum dynamical processes is the key to practical applications of quantum physics, for example in quantum information science. The manipulation of light&#8211;matter interactions at the single-atom and single-photon level can be achieved in cavity quantum electrodynamics, in particular in the regime of strong coupling in which atom and cavity form a single entity. In the optical domain, this requires a single atom at rest inside a microcavity. Here we show that an orthogonal arrangement of a cooling laser, trapping laser and cavity vacuum gives rise to a unique combination of friction forces that act along all three directions. This combination of cooling forces is applied to catch and cool a single atom in a high-finesse cavity. The high cooling efficiency leads to a low temperature and an average single-atom trapping time of 17&#160;s, during which the strongly coupled atom can be observed continuously.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik, Hans-Kopfermann-Str. 1, D-85748, Garching, Germany', 'authors': ['Stefan Nußmann', ',\xa0Karim Murr', ',\xa0Markus Hijlkema', ',\xa0Bernhard Weber', ',\xa0Axel Kuhn', '\xa0&\xa0Gerhard Rempe']}]",False,"['Stefan Nußmann', 'Karim Murr', 'Markus Hijlkema', 'Bernhard Weber', 'Axel Kuhn', 'Gerhard Rempe']","Nußmann, S., Murr, K., Hijlkema, M. et al.
