review article,The physics of core-collapse supernovae,"<p>Supernovae are nature&#8217;s grandest explosions and an astrophysical laboratory in which unique conditions exist that are not achievable on Earth. They are also the furnaces in which most of the elements heavier than carbon have been forged. Scientists have argued for decades about the physical mechanism responsible for these explosions. It is clear that the ultimate energy source is gravity, but the relative roles of neutrinos, fluid instabilities, rotation and magnetic fields continue to be debated.</p>",[],False,"[""Stan Woosley"", ""Thomas Janka""]","Woosley, S., Janka, T.

letter,Spatially modulated 'Mottness' in La2-xBaxCuO4,"<p>Competition between magnetism and the kinetic energy of mobile carriers (typically holes) in doped antiferromagnets may lead to &#8216;stripe&#8217; phases, which are charged rivers separating regions of oppositely phased antiferromagnetism. In copper oxides the main experimental evidence for such coexisting static spin and charge order comes from neutron scattering in La<sub>1.48</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LNSCO; ref.&#160;) and La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LBCO; ref.&#160;). However, as a neutron is neutral, it does not detect charge but rather its associated lattice distortion, so it is not known whether the stripes involve ordering of the doped holes. Here we present a study of the charge order in LBCO with resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS). We observe giant resonances near the Fermi level as well as near the correlated gap, demonstrating significant modulation in both the doped-hole density and the &#8216;Mottness&#8217;, or the degree to which the system resembles a Mott insulator. The peak-to-trough amplitude of the valence modulation is estimated to be 0.063 holes, which suggests an integrated area of 0.59 holes under a single stripe, close to the expected 0.5 for half-filled stripes.</p>",[],True,"[""P.

letter,Emergence of soliton chirality in a quantum antiferromagnet,"<p>Left- and right-handed chiral matter is present at every scale ranging from seashells to molecules to elementary particles. In magnetism, chirality may be inherited from the asymmetry of the underlying crystal structure, or it may emerge spontaneously. In particular, there has been a long-standing search for chiral spin states that emerge spontaneously with the disappearance of antiferromagnetic long-range order. Here we identify a generic system supporting such a behaviour and report on experimental evidence for chirality associated with the quantum dynamics of solitons in antiferromagnetic spin chains. The soliton chirality observed by polarized neutron scattering is in agreement with theoretical predictions and is a manifestation of a Berry phase. Our observations provide the first example of the emergence of spin currents and hidden chiral order that accompany the disappearance of antiferromagnetic order, a scheme believed to lie at the heart of the enigmatic normal state of cuprate&#160;superconductors.</p>",[],True,"[""Hans-Benjamin Braun"", ""Jiri Kulda"", ""Bertrand Roessli"", ""Dirk Visser"", ""Karl W.

letter,Formation of granular jets observed by high-speed X-ray radiography,"<p>When a heavy sphere is dropped onto a bed of loose, fine sand, a remarkable phenomenon occurs: a large, focused jet of sand shoots upwards. Although similar looking jets are observed on impact in fluid systems, they are held together by surface tension. Surprisingly, the granular jet exists in the absence of both surface tension and cohesion, thus fluid jet models are of limited use. Previous work proposed that the jet is created solely by the gravity-driven collapse of a void left by the sphere&#8217;s descent through the pack. Here we present experimental evidence that granular jets are instead driven by a more complex process involving the interaction between the sand and interstitial air. Using high-speed X-ray radiography, and high-speed digital video, we observe the formation of the jet both inside and above the bed. We find that what previously was thought of as a single jet in fact consists of two components: a wispy, thin jet that varies little with pressure followed by a thick air-pressure-driven jet. This is further evidence that qualitatively new phenomena in granular systems can emerge as a function of air pressure. Our results highlight the importance of the dynamic coupling between gas and granule motion.</p>",[],True,"[""John R. Royer"", ""Eric I. Corwin"", ""Andrew Flior"", ""Maria-Luisa Cordero"", ""Mark L.

letter,Oscillations with uniquely long periods in a microfluidic bubble generator,"<p>Understanding spatiotemporal complexity is important to many disciplines, from biology to finance. However, because it is seldom possible to achieve complete control over the parameters that determine the behaviour of real complex systems, it has been difficult to study such behaviour experimentally. Here we demonstrate a simple microfluidic bubble generator that shows stable oscillatory patterns (both in space and time) of unanticipated complexity and uniquely long repetition periods. At low flow rates, the device produces a regular stream of bubbles of uniform size. As the flow increases, the system shows intricate dynamic behaviour typified by a stable limit cycle of order 29 bubbles per period, which repeats without change over intervals of up to 100 periods and more. As well as providing an example of a well-characterized and experimentally tractable model system with which to study complex, nonlinear dynamics, such behaviour demonstrates that it is possible to observe complex and stable limit cycles without active external&#160;control.</p>",[],True,"[""Piotr Garstecki"", ""Michael J.

article,Soliton-pair dynamics in patterned ferromagnetic ellipses,"<p>Confinement alters the energy landscape of nanoscale magnets, leading to the appearance of unusual magnetic states, such as vortices, for example. Many basic questions concerning dynamical and interaction effects remain unanswered, and nanomagnets are convenient model systems for studying these fundamental physical phenomena. A single vortex in restricted geometry, also known as a non-localized soliton, possesses a characteristic translational excitation mode that corresponds to spiral-like motion of the vortex core around its equilibrium position. Here, we investigate, by a microwave reflection technique, the dynamics of magnetic soliton pairs confined in lithographically defined, ferromagnetic Permalloy ellipses. Through a comparison with micromagnetic simulations, the observed strong resonances in the subgigahertz frequency range can be assigned to the translational modes of vortex pairs with parallel or antiparallel core polarizations. Vortex polarizations play a negligible role in the static interaction between two vortices, but their effect dominates the&#160;dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""Kristen S. Buchanan"", ""Pierre E.

article,Fault-tolerant architecture for quantum computation using electrically controlled semiconductor spins,"<p>Information processing using quantum systems provides new paradigms for computation and communication and may yield insights into our understanding of the limits of quantum mechanics. However, realistic systems are never perfectly isolated from their environment, hence all quantum operations are subject to errors. Realization of a physical system for processing of quantum information that is tolerant of errors is a fundamental problem in quantum science and engineering. Here, we develop an architecture for quantum computation using electrically controlled semiconductor spins by extending the Loss&#8211;DiVincenzo scheme and by combining actively protected quantum memory and long-distance coupling mechanisms. Our approach is based on a demonstrated encoding of qubits in long-lived two-electron states, which immunizes qubits against the dominant error from hyperfine interactions. We develop a universal set of quantum gates compatible with active error suppression for these encoded qubits and an effective long-range interaction between the qubits by controlled electron transport. This approach yields a scalable architecture with favourable error thresholds for fault-tolerant operation, consistent with present experimental&#160;parameters.</p>",[],False,"[""J. M.

article,Distributive immunization of networks against viruses using the 'honey-pot' architecture,"<p>Although computer viruses cause tremendous economic loss, defence mechanisms fail to adapt to their rapid evolution. Previous immunization strategies have been characterized as being static and centralized, which has made virus containment difficult or even impossible. We suggest, instead, to propagate the immunization agent as an epidemic. The main problem with epidemic vaccine propagation is that it is bound to lag behind the virus. We suggest giving the vaccine an advantage over the virus by allowing it to leapfrog through a separate, overlapping, partially correlated network. This enables the antivirus to contain the epidemic efficiently. We systemize this concept with a &#8216;honey-pot&#8217; architecture that achieves both early virus discovery and rapid antivirus dissemination. We present analytic, as well as simulation, results for a set of realistic topologies that illustrate the effectiveness of this&#160;approach.</p>",[],True,"[""Jacob Goldenberg"", ""Yuval Shavitt"", ""Eran Shir"", ""Sorin Solomon""]","Goldenberg, J., Shavitt, Y., Shir, E. et al.

article,High-efficiency carrier multiplication through direct photogeneration of multi-excitons via virtual single-exciton states,"<p>We have previously demonstrated that absorption of a single photon by a nanocrystal quantum dot can generate multiple excitons with an efficiency of up to 100%. This effect, known as carrier multiplication, should lead to substantial improvements in the performance of a variety of optoelectronic and photocatalytic devices, including solar cells, low-threshold lasers and entangled photon sources. Here we present detailed analysis of the dynamics that govern the ultrafast growth of multi-exciton populations in CdSe and PbSe nanocrystals and propose a model of how such populations arise. Our analysis indicates that the generation of multi-excitons in these systems takes less than 200&#160;fs, which suggests that it is an instantaneous event. We explain this in terms of their direct photogeneration via multiple virtual single-exciton states. This process relies on both the confinement-enhanced Coulomb coupling between single excitons and multi-excitons and the large spectral density of high-energy single- and multi-exciton resonances that occur in semiconductor nanocrystals.</p>",[],False,"[""Richard D.
