letter,Transition from phase slips to the Josephson effect in a superfluid 4He weak link,"<p>The rich dynamics of flow between two weakly coupled macroscopic quantum reservoirs has led to a range of important technologies. Practical development has so far been limited to superconducting systems, for which the basic building block is the so-called superconducting Josephson weak link. With the observation of quantum oscillations in superfluid <sup>4</sup>He near 2&#160;K, we can now envision analogous practical superfluid helium devices. The characteristic function that determines the dynamics of such systems is the current&#8211;phase relation I<sub>s</sub>(&#981;), which gives the relationship between the superfluid current I<sub>s</sub> flowing through a weak link and the quantum phase difference &#981; across it. Here we report the measurement of the current&#8211;phase relation of a superfluid <sup>4</sup>He weak link formed by an array of nano-apertures separating two reservoirs of superfluid <sup>4</sup>He. As we vary the coupling strength between the two reservoirs, we observe a transition from a strongly coupled regime in which I<sub>s</sub>(&#981;) is linear and flow is limited by 2&#960; phase slips, to a weak-coupling regime where I<sub>s</sub>(&#981;) becomes the sinusoidal signature of a Josephson weak link.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, California,, 94720, USA', 'authors': ['E.

letter,Impurity effects on electron–mode coupling in high-temperature superconductors,"<p>Despite years of intensive research on copper oxide superconductors with high transition temperatures (T<sub>c</sub>), the driving force of superconductivity has not yet been clarified. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements have uncovered an important contribution of lattice vibrations (phonons) to superconductivity, sparking a fierce debate on the nature of the &#8216;glue&#8217;&#8212;phonons or magnetic excitations&#8212;binding together the superconducting Cooper pairs. However, it is difficult to distinguish these two pairing forces owing to their similar energy scales. Here, we propose a fresh approach to investigate the origin of many-body interactions in these superconductors: an impurity-substitution effect on the low-energy dynamics, which is a magnetic analogue of the isotope effect used for classical superconductors. Our ARPES results reveal that the impurity-induced changes in the electron self-energy show a good correspondence to those of magnetic excitations, indicating the importance of spin fluctuations to electron pairing in the high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan', 'authors': ['K.

letter,Macroscopic coherence of a single exciton state in an organic quantum wire,"<p>Macroscopic quantum coherence has been observed in some many-body systems including superconductors, quantum liquids and cold atom condensates, but never for a single quasi-particle state. In an ideal semiconductor, excitons (electron&#8211;hole pairs bound by the Coulomb interaction) can, in principle, exist as delocalized plane waves extending over the entire volume. However, any kind of disorder prevents long-range spatial coherence from emerging. There has been evidence for the formation of macroscopic coherent states only in condensate phases such as in the case of microcavity polaritons condensation or in a dense quasi-two-dimensional exciton gas. It is unclear however, whether in this latter case the observations are really related to macroscopic coherence. Here, we show that a single exciton state in an individual ordered conjugated polymer chain, shows macroscopic quantum spatial coherence reaching tens of micrometres, limited by the chain length. The spatial coherence of the k=0 exciton state is demonstrated by selecting two spatially separated emitting regions of the chain and observing their interference.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut des Nanosciences de Paris, CNRS UMR 7588, Université Pierre et Marie Curie et Université Denis Diderot, Campus Boucicaut, 140 rue de Lourmel, F-75015, Paris, France', 'authors': ['François Dubin', ',\xa0Romain Melet', ',\xa0Thierry Barisien', ',\xa0Roger Grousson', ',\xa0Laurent Legrand', ',\xa0Michel Schott', '\xa0&\xa0Valia Voliotis']}]",True,"['François Dubin', 'Romain Melet', 'Thierry Barisien', 'Roger Grousson', 'Laurent Legrand', 'Michel Schott', 'Valia Voliotis']","Dubin, F., Melet, R., Barisien, T. et al.

letter,Ion trap in a semiconductor chip,"<p>The electromagnetic manipulation of isolated atoms has led to many advances in physics, from laser cooling and Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation of cold gases to the precise quantum control of individual atomic ions. Work on miniaturizing electromagnetic traps to the micrometre scale promises even higher levels of control and reliability. Compared with &#8216;chip traps&#8217; for confining neutral atoms, ion traps with similar dimensions and power dissipation offer much higher confinement forces and allow unparalleled control at the single-atom level. Moreover, ion microtraps are of great interest in the development of miniature mass-spectrometer arrays, compact atomic clocks and, most notably, large-scale quantum information processors. Here we report the operation of a micrometre-scale ion trap, fabricated on a monolithic chip using semiconductor micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. We confine, laser cool and measure heating of a single <sup>111</sup>Cd<sup>+</sup> ion in an integrated radiofrequency trap etched from a doped gallium-arsenide heterostructure.</p>",,"[{'address': 'FOCUS Center and Department of Physics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA', 'authors': ['D.

letter,Bang–bang control of fullerene qubits using ultrafast phase gates,"<p>Quantum mechanics permits an entity, such as an atom, to exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously. Quantum information processing (QIP) harnesses this profound phenomenon to manipulate information in radically new ways. A fundamental challenge in all QIP technologies is the corruption of superposition in a quantum bit (qubit) through interaction with its environment. Quantum bang&#8211;bang control provides a solution by repeatedly applying &#8216;kicks&#8217; to a qubit, thus disrupting an environmental interaction. However, the speed and precision required for the kick operations has presented an obstacle to experimental realization. Here we demonstrate a phase gate of unprecedented speed on a nuclear spin qubit in a fullerene molecule, and use it to bang&#8211;bang decouple the qubit from a strong environmental interaction. We can thus trap the qubit in closed cycles on the Bloch sphere, or lock it in a given state for an arbitrary period. Our procedure uses operations on a second qubit, an electron spin, to generate an arbitrary phase on the nuclear qubit. We anticipate that the approach will be important for QIP technologies, especially at the molecular scale where other strategies, such as electrode switching, are&#160;unfeasible.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials, Oxford University, OX1 3PH, Oxford, UK', 'authors': ['John J.

letter,Femtosecond laser near-field ablation from gold nanoparticles,"<p>Short-pulse laser ablation is promising owing to the low threshold for material removal from surfaces. In the laser-ablation process, solid material transforms into a volatile phase initiated by a rapid deposition of energy. Explosive boiling can be one of the mechanisms in which matter is heated close to the critical point. Other pathways of non-thermal excitation will be present for very short laser pulses. Here we observe a different channel of ablation from gold nanoparticles, which takes place below the particle melting point. This process is induced by the optical near-field, a subwavelength field enhancement close to curved surfaces, in particular. Using picosecond X-ray scattering, we can track the temporal and energetic structural dynamics during material ejection from the nanoparticles. This effect will limit any high-power laser manipulation of nanostructured surfaces, such as surface-enhanced Raman measurements or plasmonics with femtosecond pulses.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Fachbereich Physik der Universität Konstanz, Universitätsstr. 10, D-78457, Konstanz, Germany', 'authors': ['Anton Plech', ',\xa0Vassilios Kotaidis', '\xa0&\xa0Johannes Boneberg']}, {'address': 'ESRF, BP 220, F-38043, Grenoble Cedex, France', 'authors': ['Maciej Lorenc']}]",True,"['Anton Plech', 'Vassilios Kotaidis', 'Maciej Lorenc', 'Johannes Boneberg']","Plech, A., Kotaidis, V., Lorenc, M. et al.

article,Laser-driven proton scaling laws and new paths towards energy increase,"<p>The past few years have seen remarkable progress in the development of laser-based particle accelerators. The ability to produce ultrabright beams of multi-megaelectronvolt protons routinely has many potential uses from engineering to medicine, but for this potential to be realized substantial improvements in the performances of these devices must be made. Here we show that in the laser-driven accelerator that has been demonstrated experimentally to produce the highest energy protons, scaling laws derived from fluid models and supported by numerical simulations can be used to accurately describe the acceleration of proton beams for a large range of laser and target parameters. This enables us to evaluate the laser parameters needed to produce high-energy and high-quality proton beams of interest for radiography of dense objects or proton therapy of deep-seated tumours.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire pour l’Utilisation des Lasers Intenses, UMR 7605 CNRS-CEA-École Polytechnique-Université Paris VI, 91128, Palaiseau, France', 'authors': ['J.

article,Thermal equivalence of DNA duplexes without calculation of melting temperature,"<p>The common key to nearly all processes involving DNA is the hybridization and melting of the double helix: from transmission of genetic information and RNA transcription, to polymerase chain reaction and DNA microarray analysis, DNA mechanical nanodevices and DNA computing. Selecting DNA sequences with similar melting temperatures is essential for many applications in biotechnology. We show that instead of calculating these temperatures, a single parameter can be derived from a statistical-mechanics model that conveniently represents the thermodynamic equivalence of DNA sequences.
