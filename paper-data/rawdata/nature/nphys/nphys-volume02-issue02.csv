review article,Vacuum Rabi splitting in semiconductors,"<p>The recent development of techniques to produce optical semiconductor cavities of very high quality has prepared the stage for observing cavity quantum-electrodynamic effects in solid-state materials. Among the most promising systems for these studies are semiconductor quantum dots inside photonic crystal, micropillar or microdisk resonators. We review the progress so far in obtaining true quantum-optical strong-coupling effects in semiconductors. We discuss the recent results on vacuum Rabi splitting with a single quantum dot, emphasizing the differences from quantum-well systems. Finally, we propose nonlinear tests for the true quantum limit and speculate about applications in quantum information devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Optical Sciences Center, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, 85721-0094, USA', 'authors': ['G.

letter,Energy spectroscopy of controlled coupled quantum-wire states,"<p>Quantum ballistic transport in electron waveguides (EWGs)&#160;is based on coherent quantum states arising from the one-dimensional (1D) confinement in nanometre-scale constrictions. Semiconductor EWGs have received considerable renewed interest for quantum logic devices and theoretical concepts in the context of solid-state quantum information processing. Implementation in real-world quantum circuits requires the unambiguous experimental distinction between all involved energy levels. However, such knowledge of EWGs investigated for wavefunction hybridization is solely based on estimates. Here, we present coupled EWGs that allow single-mode control and manipulation of mode coupling at temperatures as high as that of liquid-helium (4.2&#160;K) and above. We demonstrate high-resolution energy spectroscopy of each EWG subband ladder and the 1D coupled states involved. The results verify the power of advanced nanolithography and its ability to open the door to the scalable semiconductor quantum circuits envisaged today.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Werkstoffe und Nanoelektronik, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, D-44780, Bochum, Germany', 'authors': ['S.

letter,Possible evidence for electromagnons in multiferroic manganites,"<p>Magnetodielectric materials are characterized by a strong coupling of the magnetic and dielectric properties and, in rare cases, simultaneously show both magnetic and polar order. Among other multiferroics, TbMnO<sub>3</sub> and GdMnO<sub>3</sub> reveal a strong magneto&#8211;dielectric coupling and as a consequence fundamentally different spin excitations exist: electro-active magnons (or electromagnons), spin waves that can be excited by a.c.&#160;electric fields. Here we provide evidence that these excitations appear in the phase with an incommensurate magnetic structure of the manganese spins. In external magnetic fields this incommensurate structure can be suppressed and the electromagnons wiped out, thereby inducing considerable changes in the index of refraction from d.c.&#160;up to terahertz frequencies. Hence, besides adding a creature to the zoo of fundamental excitations, the refractive index can be tuned by moderate magnetic fields, which enables the design of the next generation of optical switches and optoelectronic devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Experimentalphysik V, Center for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism, Universität Augsburg, Universitätsstr. 2, 86135, Augsburg, Germany', 'authors': ['A.

letter,Diffractive imaging of highly focused X-ray fields,"<p>The rapid development of new sources of coherent X-rays, such as third-generation synchrotrons, high-harmonic-generation lasers and X-ray free-electron lasers, has led to the emergence of the new field of X-ray coherent science. The extension of coherent methods to the X-ray regime makes possible methods such as coherent diffraction, X-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy, speckle interferometry and ultrafast probing at atomic resolution and femtosecond timescales. Despite rapid improvements in the resolution that conventional X-ray optics can achieve, new methods for manipulating X-rays are required to push this to the atomic scale. Here we demonstrate a coherent imaging technique that enables us to image the complex field at the focus of an X-ray zone plate without the need for conventional X-ray lenses. There are no fundamental limits on the resolution of this lensless imaging technique other than the wavelength of the X-rays themselves. The ability to characterize the beam with one measurement makes the method ideally suited to characterizing the fields generated by pulsed coherent X-ray sources.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Physics, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, 3010, Australia', 'authors': ['H.

letter,Chemical analysis by ultrahigh-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance in the Earth's magnetic field,"<p>High-resolution NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for non-destructive structural investigations of matter. Typically, expensive and immobile superconducting magnets are required for chemical analysis by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. Here we present the feasibility of liquid-state proton (<sup>1</sup>H), lithium (<sup>7</sup>Li) and fluorine (<sup>19</sup>F) ultrahigh-resolution NMR spectroscopy in the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. We show that in the Earth&#8217;s field the transverse relaxation time T<sub>2</sub> of the <sup>7</sup>Li nucleus is very sensitive to its mobility in solution. The J-coupling constants of silicon-containing (<sup>29</sup>Si) and fluorine-containing molecules are measured with just a single scan. The accuracy of the measured <sup>1</sup>H&#8211;<sup>29</sup>Si and <sup>1</sup>H&#8211;<sup>19</sup>F J-coupling constants is between a few millihertz up to 20 mHz. This is at least one order of magnitude better than the precision obtained with superconducting magnets.

letter,Detecting rich-club ordering in complex networks,"<p>Uncovering the hidden regularities and organizational principles of networks arising in physical systems ranging from the molecular level to the scale of large communication infrastructures is the key issue in understanding their fabric and dynamical properties. The &#8216;rich-club&#8217; phenomenon refers to the tendency of nodes with high centrality, the dominant elements of the system, to form tightly interconnected communities, and it is one of the crucial properties accounting for the formation of dominant communities in both computer and social sciences. Here, we provide the analytical expression and the correct null models that allow for a quantitative discussion of the rich-club phenomenon. The presented analysis enables the measurement of the rich-club ordering and its relation with the function and dynamics of networks in examples drawn from the biological, social and technological domains.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Informatics and Department of Physics, Indiana University, Bloomington, 47406, Indiana, USA', 'authors': ['V.

article,Short gamma-ray bursts from binary neutron star mergers in globular clusters,"<p>Observations by the Swift gamma-ray-burst (GRB) mission located short GRBs in (or near) elliptical galaxies, that are no longer active in star formation. This suggested that short GRBs are produced when neutron stars (NSs) merge with other NSs or with black holes (BHs). However, the spatial offset of some short GRBs from their host galaxies is not consistent with double-neutron-star (DNS) systems formed from massive binary stars, which appear to remain in galactic disks. Instead, short GRBs may arise from NS mergers in compact binary systems that are naturally produced in globular clusters, in which extreme densities of very old stars can create and exchange compact binaries efficiently. Here we present a simple scaling from the DNS binary observed in the globular cluster M15 in our own Galaxy to the numbers expected for globular clusters around galaxies generally. We present numerical simulations that demonstrate that DNS production in globular clusters may account for &#8764;10&#8211;30% of the observed short GRBs. The much more numerous DNS merger rates predicted for galactic disks suggests their associated short GRBs are significantly more beamed, perhaps by the aligned spins and greater magnetic field of their secondary NSs.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02138, 60 Garden St., USA', 'authors': ['Jonathan Grindlay']}, {'address': 'Astronomical Institute Anton Pannekoek and Section Computational Science Kruislaan 403, 1098, SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Simon Portegies Zwart']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, 3141 Chestnut St., USA', 'authors': ['Stephen McMillan']}]",False,"['Jonathan Grindlay', 'Simon Portegies Zwart', 'Stephen McMillan']","Grindlay, J., Zwart, S. & McMillan, S.

article,How light emerges from an illuminated array of subwavelength holes,"<p>The extraordinary optical transmission through periodic arrays of subwavelength holes has been studied extensively since it was first reported in 1998, owing to both its fundamental implications and its technological potential. The picture of the underlying mechanism that emerges from most of the theoretical studies is a resonant process assisted by surface electromagnetic modes, such as surface plasmons. However, these studies consider an infinite array of holes. By combining experiment and theory, we have analysed the influence of the inherent finite size of the arrays and report here the unexpected spatial distribution of light as it emerges from the arrays. This distribution is strongly anisotropic and extremely sensitive to the angle of incidence of the impinging light. The behaviour can be explained by a model that takes into account the asymmetry induced by the array edges, and the effects this has on the emission pattern across the&#160;array.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Departamento de Física Teórica de la Materia Condensada, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, E-28049, Madrid, Spain', 'authors': ['J.

article,Conformal invariance in two-dimensional turbulence,"<p>The simplicity of fundamental physical laws manifests itself in fundamental symmetries. Although systems with an infinite number of strongly interacting degrees of freedom (in particle physics and critical phenomena) are hard to describe, they often demonstrate symmetries, in particular scale invariance. In two dimensions (2D) locality often extends scale invariance to a wider class of conformal transformations that allow non-uniform rescaling. Conformal invariance enables a thorough classification of universality classes of critical phenomena in 2D. Is there conformal invariance in 2D turbulence, a paradigmatic example of a strongly interacting non-equilibrium system? Here, we show numerically that some features of a 2D inverse turbulent cascade show conformal invariance. We observe that the statistics of vorticity clusters are remarkably close to that of critical percolation, one of the simplest universality classes of critical phenomena. These results represent a key step in the unification of 2D physics within the framework of conformal&#160;symmetry.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Service de Physique Théorique de Saclay, CEA/CNRS, Orme des Merisiers, 91191, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France', 'authors': ['D.
