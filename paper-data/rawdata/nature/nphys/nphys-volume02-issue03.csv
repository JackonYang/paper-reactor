review article,Are high-temperature superconductors exotic?,"<p>High-temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides, first discovered twenty years ago, has led researchers on a wide-ranging quest to understand and use this new state of matter. From the start, these materials have been viewed as &#8216;exotic&#8217; superconductors, for which the term exotic can take on many meanings. The breadth of work that has taken place reflects the fact that they have turned out to be exotic in almost every way imaginable. They exhibit new states of matter (d-wave superconductivity, charge stripes), dramatic manifestations of fluctuating superconductivity, plus a key inspiration and testing ground for new experimental and theoretical techniques.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 1Z1, Canada', 'authors': ['D.

letter,Superconducting nanowires as quantum phase-slip junctions,"<p>For a superconductor, charge and phase are dual quantum variables. A phase-slip event in a superconducting nanowire changes the phase difference over the wire by 2&#960;; it is the dual process to Cooper-pair tunnelling in a Josephson junction. Phase slip by thermal activation at high temperatures is well understood. Phase slip by quantum tunnelling at low temperatures is considered plausible, but experiments on the resistance of nanowires are inconclusive on this point. B&#252;chler et al.  conclude that successive quantum phase slip (QPS) events can be coherent. Here, we demonstrate that, if it exists, coherent QPS is the exact dual to Josephson tunnelling. A narrow nanowire should act as a QPS junction that shows kinetic capacitance, a plasma resonance and current plateaus of interest for nanoelectronic applications. We suggest feasible experiments to unequivocally confirm the existence for coherent QPS.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, 2628, CJ Delft, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Hard superconductivity of a soft metal in the quantum regime,"<p>Superconductivity is inevitably suppressed in reduced dimensionality. Questions of how thin superconducting wires or films can be before they lose their superconducting properties have important technological ramifications and go to the heart of understanding coherence and robustness of the superconducting state in quantum-confined geometries. Here, we exploit quantum confinement of itinerant electrons in a soft metal, Pb, to stabilize superconductors with lateral dimensions of the order of a few millimetres and vertical dimensions of only a few atomic layers. These extremely thin superconductors show no indication of defect- or fluctuation-driven suppression of superconductivity, and sustain supercurrents of up to 10% of the depairing current density. Their magnetic hardness implies a Bean-like critical state with strong vortex pinning that is attributed to quantum trapping of vortices. This study paints a conceptually appealing, elegant picture of a model nanoscale superconductor with calculable critical-state properties and surprisingly strong phase coherence. It indicates the intriguing possibility of exploiting robust superconductivity at the nanoscale.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37996, USA', 'authors': ['Mustafa M.

letter,Unconventional quantum Hall effect and Berry's phase of 2π in bilayer graphene,"<p>There are two known distinct types of the integer quantum Hall effect. One is the conventional quantum Hall effect, characteristic of two-dimensional semiconductor systems, and the other is its relativistic counterpart observed in graphene, where charge carriers mimic Dirac fermions characterized by Berry&#8217;s phase &#960;, which results in shifted positions of the Hall plateaus. Here we report a third type of the integer quantum Hall effect. Charge carriers in bilayer graphene have a parabolic energy spectrum but are chiral and show Berry&#8217;s phase 2&#960; affecting their quantum dynamics. The Landau quantization of these fermions results in plateaus in Hall conductivity at standard integer positions, but the last (zero-level) plateau is missing. The zero-level anomaly is accompanied by metallic conductivity in the limit of low concentrations and high magnetic fields, in stark contrast to the conventional, insulating behaviour in this regime. The revealed chiral fermions have no known analogues and present an intriguing case for quantum-mechanical studies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Manchester Centre for Mesoscience and Nanotechnology, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, UK', 'authors': ['K.

letter,Kinetic development of crystallization fronts in complex plasmas,"<p>Although it is relatively straightforward to measure the atomic structure of crystals, the detailed dynamics of crystal growth (including the evolution of self-organization, structure formation, and the associated kinetic and thermodynamic development) remains one of the most important topics of solid-state physics. Very little is known, for instance, about the evolutionary paths of crystal structure development, and the structural complexity of the surface down to atomic dimensions and its change with time. This is, to a large extent, due to the lack of suitable systems that can be studied at the appropriate length- and timescales. Here, we report experimental observations of a crystallization front propagating in a supercooled region of a three-dimensional fluid complex plasma. The structure and evolution of the front are analysed using kinetic measurements of individual microparticle dynamics. It is found that the fluid&#8211;crystalline transition is accompanied by short-lived &#8216;nano&#8217;-crystallites in the fluid and &#8216;nano&#8217;-droplets in the crystalline phases, that the surface structure is scale-free (fractal) in the experimentally accessible regime (2&#8211;10 lattice distances) and that crystal growth follows a universal self-organization pattern at the particle level, leading to oscillations in the surface&#160;roughness.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Max-Planck-Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, 85741, Garching, Germany', 'authors': ['M.

letter,Microstructure and viscoelasticity of confined semiflexible polymer networks,"<p>The rapidly decreasing dimensions of many technological devices have spurred interest in confinement effects. Long before, living organisms invented ingenious ways to cope with the requirement of space-saving designs down to the cellular level. Typical length scales in cells range from nanometres to micrometres so that the polymeric constituents of the cytoskeleton are often geometrically confined. Hence, the mechanical response of polymers to external confinement has potential implications both for technology and for our understanding of biological systems alike. Here we report a study of in vitro polymerized filamentous actin confined to emulsion droplets. We correlate observations of the microstructure, local rheological properties and single-filament fluctuations. Enforcing progressively narrower confinement is found to induce a reduction of polymer fluctuations, network stiffening, structural heterogeneities and eventually cortex formation. We argue that the structural and mechanical effects can be consistently explained by a gradual suppression of single-polymer eigenmodes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'E22-Biophysics, Technische Universität München, James Franck Straße, 85748, Garching, Germany', 'authors': ['M.

article,Electric-dipole-induced spin resonance in disordered semiconductors,"<p>One of the hallmarks of spintronics is the control of magnetic moments by electric fields enabled by strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction (SOI) in semiconductors. A powerful way of manipulating spins in such structures is electric-dipole-induced spin resonance (EDSR), where the radio-frequency fields driving the spins are electric, not magnetic as in standard paramagnetic resonance. Here, we present a theoretical study of EDSR for a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of disorder, where random impurities not only determine the electric resistance but also the spin dynamics through SOI. Considering a specific geometry with the electric and magnetic fields parallel and in-plane, we show that the magnetization develops an out-of-plane component at resonance that survives the presence of disorder. We also discuss the spin Hall current generated by EDSR. These results are derived in a diagrammatic approach, with the dominant effects coming from the spin vertex correction, and the optimal parameter regime for observation is&#160;identified.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Basel, CH-4056, Basel, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Mathias Duckheim', '\xa0&\xa0Daniel Loss']}]",False,"['Mathias Duckheim', 'Daniel Loss']","Duckheim, M., Loss, D.

article,Frustration on the way to crystallization in glass,"<p>Some liquids do not crystallize below the melting point, but instead enter into a supercooled state and on cooling eventually become a glass at the glass-transition temperature. During this process, the liquid dynamics not only drastically slow down, but also become progressively more heterogeneous. The relationship between the kinetic slowing down and growing dynamic heterogeneity is a key problem of the liquid&#8211;glass transition. Here, we study this problem by using a liquid model, with a crystalline ground state, for which we can systematically control frustration against crystallization. We found that slow regions having a high degree of crystalline order emerge below the melting point, and their characteristic size and lifetime increase steeply on cooling. These crystalline regions lead to dynamic heterogeneity, suggesting a connection to the complex free-energy landscape and the resulting slow dynamics.
