progress article,A bottom-up approach to cell mechanics,"<p>The mechanical stability and integrity of biological cells is provided by the cytoskeleton, a semidilute meshwork of biopolymers. Recent research has underscored its role as a dynamic, multifunctional muscle, whose passive and active mechanical performance is highly heterogeneous in space and time and intimately linked to many biological functions, such that it may serve as a sensitive indicator for the health or developmental state of the cell. In vitro reconstitution of &#8216;functional modules&#8217; of the cytoskeleton is now seen as a way of balancing the mutually conflicting demands for simplicity, which is required for systematic and quantitative studies, and for a sufficient degree of complexity that allows a faithful representation of biological functions. This bottom-up strategy, aimed at unravelling biological complexity from its physical basis, builds on the latest advances in technology, experimental design and theoretical modelling, which are reviewed in this progress report.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

letter,Optical probing of composite fermions in a two-dimensional electron gas,"<p>In a high magnetic field, electrons confined to two dimensions form highly correlated states driven entirely by electron&#8211;electron interactions. Transport and cyclotron-resonance experiments on these fractional quantum Hall effect states, and the associated fractionally charged excitations, suggest the existence of composite fermions&#8212;electrons with two flux quanta attached. Using optical spectroscopy, we show that the two flux quanta in a composite fermion interacting with an exciton (a bound state of an electron and a hole) lead to filling-factor-dependent features in the optical emission spectrum, which are symmetric around filling factor &#957;=1/2, and fractionally charged excitations lead to fractionally charged excitons. In the vicinity of the incompressible &#957;=1/3 state we observe a doublet structure in the emission line, corresponding to excitations of the incompressible fluid. At filling factors &#957;&gt;1/3, corresponding to the transition to a compressible metallic state, a new emission line appears, which we attribute to the fractionally charged quasi-exciton.</p>",[],True,"[""M.

letter,Magnetism at the interface between ferromagnetic and superconducting oxides,"<p>Carefully controlled interfaces between two materials can give rise to novel physical phenomena and functionalities not exhibited by either of the constituent materials alone. Modern synthesis methods have yielded high-quality heterostructures of oxide materials with competing order parameters. Although magnetic correlations at the interface are expected to be important in determining the macroscopic properties of such systems, a quantitative determination of the interfacial magnetization profile has thus far not been reported. Here we examine superlattices composed of the half-metallic ferromagnet La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> and the high-temperature superconductor YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> by absorption spectroscopy with circularly polarized X-rays and by off-specular neutron reflectometry. The resulting data yield microscopic insight into the interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom at the interface. The experiments also reveal an extensive rearrangement of the magnetic domain structure at the superconducting transition temperature. This methodology establishes an incisive probe of the interplay between competing electronic order parameters in oxide heterostructures.</p>",[],True,"[""J. Chakhalian"", ""J. W. Freeland"", ""G.

letter,Zero-point entropy in stuffed spin-ice,"<p>The third law of thermodynamics dictates that the entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium goes to zero as its temperature approaches absolute zero. In ice, however, a &#8216;zero point&#8217; or residual entropy can be measured&#8212;attributable to a high degeneracy in the energetically preferred positions of hydrogen ions associated with the so-called &#8216;ice rules&#8217;. Remarkably, the spins in certain magnetic materials with the pyrochlore structure of corner-sharing tetrahedra, called &#8216;spin ice&#8217;, have an equivalent degeneracy of energetically preferred states, and also have a zero-point entropy. Here, we chemically alter Ho<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> spin ice by &#8216;stuffing&#8217; extra Ho magnetic moments into otherwise non-magnetic Ti sites surrounding the Ho tetrahedra. The resulting series, Ho<sub>2</sub>(Ti<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Ho<sub>x</sub>)O<sub>7&#8722;x/2</sub>, provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of increased connectivity between spins on a frustrated lattice. Surprisingly, the zero-point entropy per spin measured appears unchanged by these excess spins.

letter,Partial coalescence of drops at liquid interfaces,"<p>When two separate masses of the same fluid are brought gently into contact, they are expected to fully merge into a single larger mass to minimize surface energy. However, when a stationary drop coalesces with an underlying reservoir of identical fluid, merging does not always proceed to completion. Occasionally, a drop in the process of merging apparently defies surface tension by &#8216;pinching off&#8217; before total coalescence occurs, leaving behind a smaller daughter droplet. Moreover, this process can repeat itself for subsequent generations of daughter droplets, resulting in a cascade of self-similar events. Such partial coalescence behaviour has implications for the dynamics of a variety of systems, including the droplets in clouds, ocean mist and airborne salt particles, emulsions, and the generation of vortices near an interface. Although it was first observed almost half a century ago, little is known about its precise mechanism. Here, we combine high-speed video imaging with numerical simulations to determine the conditions under which partial coalescence occurs, and to reveal a dynamic pinch-off mechanism. This mechanism is critically dependent on the ability of capillary waves to vertically stretch the drop by focusing energy on its summit.</p>",[],True,"[""Fran\u00e7ois Blanchette"", ""Terry P.

letter,Phase retrieval and differential phase-contrast imaging with low-brilliance X-ray sources,"<p>X-ray radiographic absorption imaging is an invaluable tool in medical diagnostics and materials science. For biological tissue samples, polymers or fibre composites, however, the use of conventional X-ray radiography is limited due to their weak absorption. This is resolved at highly brilliant X-ray synchrotron or micro-focus sources by using phase-sensitive imaging methods to improve the contrast. However, the requirements of the illuminating radiation mean that hard-X-ray phase-sensitive imaging has until now been impractical with more readily available X-ray sources, such as X-ray tubes. In this letter, we report how a setup consisting of three transmission gratings can efficiently yield quantitative differential phase-contrast images with conventional X-ray tubes. In contrast with existing techniques, the method requires no spatial or temporal coherence, is mechanically robust, and can be scaled up to large fields of view. Our method provides all the benefits of contrast-enhanced phase-sensitive imaging, but is also fully compatible with conventional absorption radiography. It is applicable to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing, and to other low-brilliance radiation, such as neutrons or atoms.</p>",[],True,"[""Franz Pfeiffer"", ""Timm Weitkamp"", ""Oliver Bunk"", ""Christian David""]","Pfeiffer, F., Weitkamp, T., Bunk, O. et al.

article,The optical response of nanostructured surfaces and the composite diffracted evanescent wave model,"<p>Investigations of the optical response of subwavelength-structure arrays milled into thin metal films have revealed surprising phenomena, including reports of unexpectedly high transmission of light. Many studies have interpreted the optical coupling to the surface in terms of the resonant excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), but other approaches involving composite diffraction of surface evanescent waves (CDEW) have also been proposed. Here we present a series of measurements on very simple one-dimensional subwavelength structures to test the key properties of the surface waves, and compare them to the CDEW and SPP models. We find that the optical response of the silver metal surface proceeds in two steps: a diffractive perturbation in the immediate vicinity (2&#8211;3&#160;&#956; m) of the structure, followed by excitation of a persistent surface wave that propagates over tens of micrometres. The measured wavelength and phase of this persistent wave are significantly shifted from those expected for resonance excitation of a conventional SPP on a pure silver&#160;surface.</p>",[],False,"[""G.

article,The shapes of cooperatively rearranging regions in glass-forming liquids,"<p>The cooperative rearrangement of groups of many molecules has long been thought to underlie the dramatic slowing of liquid dynamics on cooling towards the glassy state. For instance, there exists experimental evidence for cooperatively rearranging regions (CRRs) on the nanometre length scale near the glass transition. The random first-order transition (RFOT) theory of glasses predicts that, near the glass-transition temperature, these regions are compact, but computer simulations and experiments on colloids suggest CRRs are string-like. Here, we present a microscopic theory within the framework of RFOT, which unites the two situations. We show that the shapes of CRRs in glassy liquids should change from being compact at low temperatures to fractal or &#8216;stringy&#8217; as the dynamical crossover temperature from activated to collisional transport is approached from below. This theory predicts a correlation of the ratio of the dynamical crossover temperature to the laboratory glass-transition temperature, and the heat-capacity discontinuity at the glass transition. The predicted correlation quantitatively agrees with experimental results for 21 materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Jacob D. Stevenson"", ""J\u00f6rg Schmalian"", ""Peter G.

article,Origins of fractality in the growth of complex networks,"<p>Complex networks from such different fields as biology, technology or sociology share similar organization principles. The possibility of a unique growth mechanism promises to uncover universal origins of collective behaviour. In particular, the emergence of self-similarity in complex networks raises the fundamental question of the growth process according to which these structures evolve. Here we investigate the concept of renormalization as a mechanism for the growth of fractal and non-fractal modular networks. We show that the key principle that gives rise to the fractal architecture of networks is a strong effective &#8216;repulsion&#8217; (or, disassortativity) between the most connected nodes (that is, the hubs) on all length scales, rendering them very dispersed. More importantly, we show that a robust network comprising functional modules, such as a cellular network, necessitates a fractal topology, suggestive of an evolutionary drive for their existence.</p>",[],False,"[""Chaoming Song"", ""Shlomo Havlin"", ""Hern\u00e1n A.

article,Single-molecule force spectroscopy reveals signatures of glassy dynamics in the energy landscape of ubiquitin,"<p>The conformational energy landscape of a protein out of equilibrium is poorly understood. We use single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to measure the kinetics of unfolding of the protein ubiquitin under a constant force. We discover a surprisingly broad distribution of unfolding rates that follows a power law with no characteristic mean. The structural fluctuations that give rise to this distribution reveal the architecture of the protein&#8217;s energy landscape. Following models of glassy dynamics, this complex kinetics implies large fluctuations in the energies of the folded protein, characterized by an exponential distribution with a width of 5&#8211;10k<sub>B</sub>T. Our results predict the existence of a &#8216;glass transition&#8217; force below which the folded conformations interconvert between local minima on multiple timescales.
