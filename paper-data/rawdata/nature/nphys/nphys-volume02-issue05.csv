review article,The role of isospin symmetry in collective nuclear structure,"<p>The nucleus is a unique laboratory in physics&#160;&#8212;&#160;a quantum many-body system comprising two types of fermion, the neutron and proton, differing in charge but otherwise essentially identical in their behaviour. The fact that the strong interaction between these fermions is largely independent of charge results in striking symmetries in nuclei. This neutron&#8211;proton exchange invariance is encompassed in the elegant concept and formalism of Wigner&#8217;s isotopic spin&#160;&#8212;&#160;or isospin. The impact of isospin symmetry is maximal near the N=Z line where nuclei have equal numbers of neutrons and protons, and studies involving isospin effects have undergone a resurgence in recent years as such nuclei become more readily accessible. In this review we discuss three isospin-related phenomena: the elegant isospin symmetry of excited analogue states in nuclei, the origin of the extra binding for nuclei with equal numbers of neutrons and protons and the exotic phenomenon of neutron&#8211;proton pairing. These three topics, all of considerable current interest, demonstrate the power, simplicity and modern relevance of the isospin concept.</p>",[],False,"[""D. D. Warner"", ""M. A. Bentley"", ""P.

letter,Controlling attosecond electron dynamics by phase-stabilized polarization gating,"<p>Attosecond electron wavepackets are produced when an intense laser field ionizes an atom or a molecule. When the laser field drives the wavepackets back to the parent ion, they interfere with the bound wavefunction, producing coherent subfemtosecond extreme-ultraviolet light bursts. When only a single return is possible, an isolated attosecond pulse is generated. Here we demonstrate that by modulating the polarization of a carrier-envelope phase-stabilized short laser pulse, we can finely control the electron-wavepacket dynamics. We use high-order harmonic generation to probe these dynamics. Under optimized conditions, we observe the signature of a single return of the electron wavepacket over a large range of energies. This temporally confines the extreme-ultraviolet emission to an isolated attosecond pulse with a broad and tunable bandwidth. Our approach is very general, and extends the bandwidth of attosecond isolated pulses in such a way that pulses of a few attoseconds seem achievable. Similar temporal resolution could also be achieved by directly using the broadband electron wavepacket. This opens up a new regime for time-resolved tomography of atomic or molecular wavefunctions and ultrafast&#160;dynamics.</p>",[],True,"[""I. J. Sola"", ""E. M\u00e9vel"", ""L. Elouga"", ""E.

letter,Attosecond electron wave packet interferometry,"<p>Acomplete quantum-mechanical description of matter and its interaction with the environment requires detailed knowledge of a number of complex parameters. In particular, information about the phase of wavefunctions is important for predicting the behaviour of atoms, molecules or larger systems. In optics, information about the evolution of the phase of light in time and space is obtained by interferometry. To obtain similar information for atoms and molecules, it is vital to develop analogous techniques. Here we present an interferometric method for determining the phase variation of electronic wave packets in momentum space, and demonstrate its applicability to the fundamental process of single-photon ionization. We use a sequence of extreme-ultraviolet attosecond pulses to ionize argon atoms and an infrared laser field, which induces a momentum shear between consecutive electron wave packets. The interferograms that result from the interaction of these wave packets provide useful information about their phase. This technique opens a promising new avenue for reconstructing the wavefunctions of atoms and molecules and for following the ultrafast dynamics of electronic wave packets.</p>",[],True,"[""T.

letter,Determination of the carrier-envelope phase of few-cycle laser pulses with terahertz-emission spectroscopy,"<p>The availability of few-cycle optical pulses opens a window to physical phenomena occurring on the attosecond timescale. To take full advantage of such pulses, it is crucial to measure and stabilize their carrier-envelope (CE) phase, that is, the phase difference between the carrier wave and the envelope function. We introduce an approach to determine the CE phase by down-conversion of the laser light to the terahertz (THz) frequency range by means of plasma generation in ambient air, an isotropic medium where optical rectification (down-conversion) in the forward direction is only possible if the inversion symmetry is broken by electrical or optical means. We show that few-cycle pulses directly produce a spatial charge asymmetry in the plasma. The asymmetry, associated with THz emission, depends on the CE phase, which allows determination of the phase by measurement of the amplitude and polarity of the THz pulse.</p>",[],True,"[""Markus Kre\u00df"", ""Torsten L\u00f6ffler"", ""Mark D.

letter,A Stern–Gerlach experiment for slow light,"<p>Electromagnetically induced transparency allows light transmission through dense atomic media by means of quantum interference. Media with electromagnetically induced transparency have very interesting properties, such as extremely slow group velocities. Quasiparticles, the so-called dark polaritons, which are mixtures of a photonic and an atomic contribution, are associated with slow light propagation. Here, we demonstrate that these excitations behave as particles with a non-zero magnetic moment, which is in clear contrast to the properties of a free photon. It is found that light passing through a rubidium gas cell, under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency, is deflected by a small magnetic field gradient. The deflection angle is proportional to the optical propagation time through the cell. The beam deflection observed can be understood by assuming that dark-state polaritons have an effective magnetic moment. Our experiment can be described in terms of a Stern&#8211;Gerlach experiment for the&#160;polaritons.</p>",[],True,"[""Leon Karpa"", ""Martin Weitz""]","Karpa, L., Weitz, M.

letter,Correlation-induced inhomogeneity in circular quantum dots,"<p>Properties of the &#8216;electron gas&#8217;&#8212;in which conduction electrons interact by means of Coulomb forces but ionic potentials are neglected&#8212;change dramatically depending on the balance between kinetic energy and Coulomb repulsion. The limits are well understood. For very weak interactions (high density), the system behaves as a Fermi liquid, with delocalized electrons. In contrast, in the strongly interacting limit (low density), the electrons localize and order into a Wigner crystal phase. The physics at intermediate densities, however, remains a subject of fundamental research. Here, we study the intermediate-density electron gas confined to a circular disc, where the degree of confinement can be tuned to control the density. Using accurate quantum Monte Carlo techniques, we show that the electron&#8211;electron correlation induced by an increase of the interaction first smoothly causes rings, and then angular modulation, without any signature of a sharp transition in this density range. This suggests that inhomogeneities in a confined system, which exist even without interactions, are significantly enhanced by correlations.</p>",[],True,"[""Amit Ghosal"", ""A. D.

article,A toolbox for lattice-spin models with polar molecules,"<p>There is growing interest in states of matter with topological order. These are characterized by highly stable ground states robust to perturbations that preserve the topology, and which support excitations with so-called anyonic statistics. Topologically ordered states can arise in two-dimensional lattice-spin models, which were proposed as the basis for a new class of quantum computation. Here, we show that the relevant hamiltonians for such spin lattice models can be systematically engineered with polar molecules stored in optical lattices, where the spin is represented by a single-valence electron of a heteronuclear molecule. The combination of microwave excitation with dipole&#8211;dipole interactions and spin&#8211;rotation couplings enables building a complete toolbox for effective two-spin interactions with designable range, spatial anisotropy and coupling strengths significantly larger than relevant decoherence rates. Finally, we illustrate two models: one with an energy gap providing for error-resilient qubit encoding, and another leading to topologically protected quantum&#160;memory.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Optimal dynamical range of excitable networks at criticality,"<p>A recurrent idea in the study of complex systems is that optimal information processing is to be found near phase transitions. However, this heuristic hypothesis has few (if any) concrete realizations where a standard and biologically relevant quantity is optimized at criticality. Here we give a clear example of such a phenomenon: a network of excitable elements has its sensitivity and dynamic range maximized at the critical point of a non-equilibrium phase transition. Our results are compatible with the essential role of gap junctions in olfactory glomeruli and retinal ganglionar cell output. Synchronization and global oscillations also emerge from the network dynamics. We propose that the main functional role of electrical coupling is to provide an enhancement of dynamic range, therefore allowing the coding of information spanning several orders of magnitude. The mechanism could provide a microscopic neural basis for psychophysical laws.</p>",[],False,"[""Osame Kinouchi"", ""Mauro Copelli""]","Kinouchi, O., Copelli, M.
