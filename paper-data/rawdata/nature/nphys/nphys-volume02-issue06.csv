letter,Atomic excitation during recollision-free ultrafast multi-electron tunnel ionization,"<p>Modern intense ultrafast pulsed lasers generate an electric field of sufficient strength to permit tunnel ionization of the valence electrons in atoms. This process is usually treated as a rapid succession of isolated events, in which the states of the remaining electrons are neglected. Such electronic interactions are predicted to be weak, the exception being recollision excitation and ionization caused by linearly polarized radiation. In contrast, it has recently been suggested that intense field ionization may be accompanied by a two-stage 'shake-up' reaction. Here we report a unique combination of experimental techniques that allows us to accurately measure the tunnel ionization probability for argon exposed to 50-fs laser pulses. Most significantly for the current study, this measurement is independent of the optical focal geometry, equivalent to a homogenous electric field. Furthermore, circularly polarized radiation negates recollision. The present measurements indicate that tunnel ionization results in simultaneous excitation of one or more remaining electrons through shake-up. From an atomic physics standpoint, it may be possible to induce ionization from specific states, and will influence the development of coherent attosecond extreme-ultraviolet-radiation sources. Such pulses have vital scientific and economic potential in areas such as high-resolution imaging of in&#160;vivo cells and nanoscale extreme-ultraviolet lithography.</p>",[],True,"[""W. A.

letter,Rapid sympathetic cooling to Fermi degeneracy on a chip,"<p>Neutral fermions present new opportunities for testing models of many-body quantum systems, realizing precision atom interferometry, producing ultra-cold molecules, and investigating fundamental forces. However, since they were first observed, quantum degenerate Fermi gases (DFGs) have continued to be challenging to produce, and have been realized in only a handful of laboratories. In this letter, we report the production of a DFG using a simple apparatus based on a microfabricated magnetic trap. Similar approaches applied to Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation of <sup>87</sup>Rb (refs&#160;) have accelerated evaporative cooling and eliminated the need for multiple vacuum chambers. We demonstrate sympathetic cooling for the first time in a microtrap, and cool <sup>40</sup>K to Fermi degeneracy in just six seconds&#8212;faster than has been possible in conventional magnetic traps. To understand our sympathetic cooling trajectory, we measure the temperature dependence of the <sup>40</sup> K&#8211;<sup>87</sup>Rb cross-section and observe its Ramsauer&#8211;Townsend&#160;reduction.</p>",[],True,"[""S.

letter,Stimulated Brillouin scattering from multi-GHz-guided acoustic phonons in nanostructured photonic crystal fibres,"<p>Wavelength-scale periodic microstructuring dramatically alters the optical properties of materials. An example is glass photonic crystal fibre (PCF), which guides light by means of a lattice of hollow micro/nanochannels running axially along its length. In this letter, we explore stimulated Brillouin scattering in PCFs with subwavelength-scale solid silica glass cores. The large refractive-index difference between air and glass allows much tighter confinement of light than is possible in all-solid single-mode glass optical fibres made using conventional techniques. When the silica-air PCF has a core diameter of around 70% of the vacuum wavelength of the launched laser light, we find that the spontaneous Brillouin signal develops a highly unusual multi-peaked spectrum with Stokes frequency shifts in the 10-GHz range. We attribute these peaks to several families of guided acoustic modes each with different proportions of longitudinal and shear strain, strongly localized to the core. At the same time, the threshold power for stimulated Brillouin scattering increases fivefold. The results show that Brillouin scattering is strongly affected by nanoscale microstructuring, opening new opportunities for controlling light&#8212;sound interactions in optical fibres.</p>",[],True,"[""P.

letter,Critical phenomena in atmospheric precipitation,"<p>Critical phenomena occur near continuous phase transitions. As a tuning parameter crosses its critical value, an order parameter increases as a power law. At criticality, order-parameter fluctuations diverge and their spatial correlation decays as a power law. In systems where the tuning parameter and order parameter are coupled, the critical point can become an attractor, and self-organized criticality (SOC) results. Here we argue, using satellite data, that a critical value of water vapour (the tuning parameter) marks a non-equilibrium continuous phase transition to a regime of strong atmospheric convection and precipitation (the order parameter)&#8212;with correlated regions on scales of tens to hundreds of kilometres. Despite the complexity of atmospheric dynamics, we find that important observables conform to the simple functional forms predicted by the theory of critical phenomena. In meteorology the term 'quasi-equilibrium' refers to a balance between slow large-scale driving processes and rapid release of buoyancy by moist convection. Our study indicates that the attractive quasi-equilibrium state, postulated long before SOC (ref.&#160;), is the critical point of a continuous phase transition and is thus an instance of SOC.</p>",[],True,"[""Ole Peters"", ""J.

article,Distinct spinon and holon dispersions in photoemission spectral functions from one-dimensional SrCuO2,"<p>Spin and charge are inseparable traits of an electron, but in one-dimensional solids, theory predicts their separation into collective modes&#8212;as independent excitation quanta (or particles) called spinons and holons. Experimentalists have long sought to verify this effect. Angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) should provide the most direct evidence of spin&#8211;charge separation, as the single quasiparticle peak splits into a spinon&#8211;holon two-peak-like structure. Despite extensive ARPES experiments, the unambiguous observation of the two-peak structure has remained elusive. Here we report ARPES data from SrCuO<sub>2</sub>, made possible by recent technological developments, that unequivocally show the spinon&#8211;holon two-peak structure and their distinct dispersions. The spinon and holon branches are found to have energy scales of &#8764;0.43 and 1.3 eV, respectively, which are in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.</p>",[],False,"[""B. J.

article,The loss of vortex line tension sets an upper limit to the irreversibility line in YBa2Cu3O7,"<p>In high-temperature superconductors, magnetic field lines penetrate the samples through vortices arranged in an Abrikosov vortex lattice. In a magnetic field H<sub>m</sub>(T&#160;) below the upper critical field H<sub>c2</sub>(T&#160;) that destroys bulk superconductivity, the vortex lattice melts to a liquid vortex state, in which each vortex line must be &#8216;pinned&#8217; individually to prevent dissipation. Linear and planar defects have been found to be effective for pinning the vortex liquid because they trap an entire vortex within a single extended defect. However, up to now it is not known how far into the liquid state this pinning process can be effective. Here, we show that there is a universal magnetic field line H<sub>l</sub>(T&#160;) between H<sub>m</sub>(T&#160;) and H<sub>c2</sub>(T&#160;), where thermodynamic fluctuations of the order parameter can cause vortex unpinning from extended defects. This magnetic field H<sub>l</sub>(T&#160;) sets an upper limit to the irreversibility line H<sub>irr</sub>(T&#160;) marking the onset of dissipation.

article,Room-temperature coherent coupling of single spins in diamond,"<p>Coherent coupling between single quantum objects is at the very heart of modern quantum physics. When the coupling is strong enough to prevail over decoherence, it can be used to engineer quantum entangled states. Entangled states have attracted widespread attention because of applications to quantum computing and long-distance quantum communication. For such applications, solid-state hosts are preferred for scalability reasons, and spins are the preferred quantum system in solids because they offer long coherence times. Here we show that a single pair of strongly coupled spins in diamond, associated with a nitrogen-vacancy defect and a nitrogen atom, respectively, can be optically initialized and read out at room temperature. To effect this strong coupling, close proximity of the two spins is required, but large distances from other spins are needed to avoid deleterious decoherence. These requirements were reconciled by implanting molecular nitrogen into high-purity diamond.</p>",[],False,"[""Torsten Gaebel"", ""Michael Domhan"", ""Iulian Popa"", ""Christoffer Wittmann"", ""Philipp Neumann"", ""Fedor Jelezko"", ""James R.

article,Annealed high-density amorphous ice under pressure,"<p>The well-known expansion of water on cooling below 277&#160;K is one of several peculiar properties that could signal a second critical point near 220&#160;K and 0.1&#160;GPa in pressure, deep in the supercooled liquid phase. Evidence for this would be a first-order transition line between two distinct supercooled liquids at temperatures below the critical point. As that lies below the minimum crystallization temperature, experimental tests have instead used low-&#160;and high-density amorphous ices&#8212;LDA and HDA&#8212;as proxies for the supercooled liquids. But numerous studies over the past decade have not yielded a clear consensus about the nature of the HDA/LDA transition. Here we identify a previously uncharacterized state of high-density amorphous ice obtained if HDA is annealed at pressures near 2&#160;kbar. The transition between this annealed HDA and LDA is strikingly different from the behaviour found in earlier work, in a way that favours the two-liquid model.</p>",[],False,"[""Richard J.

article,Edge stability and transport control with resonant magnetic perturbations in collisionless tokamak plasmas,"<p>A critical issue for fusion-plasma research is the erosion of the first wall of the experimental device due to impulsive heating from repetitive edge magneto-hydrodynamic instabilities known as 'edge-localized modes' (ELMs). Here, we show that the addition of small resonant magnetic field perturbations completely eliminates ELMs while maintaining a steady-state high-confinement (H-mode) plasma. These perturbations induce a chaotic behaviour in the magnetic field lines, which reduces the edge pressure gradient below the ELM instability threshold. The pressure gradient reduction results from a reduction in the particle content of the plasma, rather than an increase in the electron thermal transport. This is inconsistent with the predictions of stochastic electron heat transport theory. These results provide a first experimental test of stochastic transport theory in a highly rotating, hot, collisionless plasma and demonstrate a promising solution to the critical issue of controlling edge instabilities in fusion-plasma devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Todd E.
