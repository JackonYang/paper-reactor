letter,Evolution of the pseudogap from Fermi arcs to the nodal liquid,"<p>The response of a material to external stimuli depends on its low-energy excitations. In conventional metals, these excitations are electrons on the Fermi surface&#8212;a contour in momentum (k) space that encloses all of the occupied states for non-interacting electrons. The pseudogap phase in the copper oxide superconductors, however, is a most unusual state of matter. It is metallic, but part of its Fermi surface is &#8216;gapped out&#8217; (refs&#160;); low-energy electronic excitations occupy disconnected segments known as Fermi arcs. Two main interpretations of its origin have been proposed: either the pseudogap is a precursor to superconductivity, or it arises from another order competing with superconductivity. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that the anisotropy of the pseudogap in k-space and the resulting arcs depend only on the ratio T/T<sup>*</sup>(x), where T<sup>*</sup>(x) is the temperature below which the pseudogap first develops at a given hole doping x. The arcs collapse linearly with T/T<sup>*</sup>(x) and extrapolate to zero extent as T&#8594;0. This suggests that the T=0 pseudogap state is a nodal liquid&#8212;a strange metallic state whose gapless excitations exist only at points in k-space, just as in a d-wave superconducting state.</p>",[],True,"[""A.

letter,Melting of a 2D quantum electron solid in high magnetic field,"<p>The melting temperature T<sub>m</sub> of a solid is generally determined by its solid&#8211;liquid transition on being heated at a fixed pressure, usually ambient pressure. It is also determined indirectly by the density n by means of the equation of state. This remains true even for solid helium, in which quantum effects often lead to unusual properties. Here, we present experimental evidence to show that for a two-dimensional (2D) solid formed by electrons in a semiconductor sample under a strong perpendicular magnetic field (B), T<sub>m</sub> is not controlled by n, but effectively by the quantum correlation between the electrons through the Landau level filling factor &#957;=n h/e B (where h is the Planck constant and e is the electronic charge). Such melting behaviour, different from that of all other known solids (including a classical 2D electron solid at zero magnetic field), suggests the quantum nature of the magnetic-field-induced electron solid. Moreover, T<sub>m</sub> increases with the strength of the sample-dependent disorder that tends to pin the electron solid in place.</p>",[],True,"[""Yong P. Chen"", ""G. Sambandamurthy"", ""Z. H.

letter,High harmonic generation in the relativistic limit,"<p>The generation of extremely bright coherent X-ray pulses in the femtosecond and attosecond regime is currently one of the most exciting frontiers of physics&#8211;allowing, for the first time, measurements with unprecedented temporal resolution. Harmonics from laser&#8211;solid target interactions have been identified as a means of achieving fields as high as the Schwinger limit (E=1.3&#215;10<sup>16</sup>&#160;V&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>) and as a highly promising route to high-efficiency attosecond (10<sup>&#8722;18</sup>&#8201;s) pulses owing to their intrinsically phase-locked nature. The key steps to attain these goals are achieving high conversion efficiencies and a slow decay of harmonic efficiency to high orders by driving harmonic production to the relativistic limit. Here we present the first experimental demonstration of high harmonic generation in the relativistic limit, obtained on the Vulcan Petawatt laser. High conversion efficiencies (&#951;&gt;10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> per harmonic) and bright emission (&gt;10<sup>22</sup> photons s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;mm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#8201;mrad<sup>&#8722;2</sup> (0.1% bandwidth)) are observed at wavelengths &lt;4&#8201;nm (the `water-window' region of particular interest for bio-microscopy).</p>",[],True,"[""B.

letter,Non-equilibrium singlet–triplet Kondo effect in carbon nanotubes,"<p>The Kondo effect is a many-body phenomenon arising due to conduction electrons scattering off a localized spin. Coherent spin-flip scattering off such a quantum impurity correlates the conduction electrons, and at low temperature this leads to a zero-bias conductance anomaly. This has become a common signature in bias spectroscopy of single-electron transistors, observed in GaAs quantum dots as well as in various single-molecule transistors. Although the zero-bias Kondo effect is well established, the extent to which Kondo correlations persist in non-equilibrium situations where inelastic processes induce decoherence remains uncertain. Here we report on a pronounced conductance peak observed at finite bias voltage in a carbon-nanotube quantum dot in the spin-singlet ground state. We explain this finite-bias conductance anomaly by a non-equilibrium Kondo effect involving excitations into a spin-triplet state. Excellent agreement between calculated and measured nonlinear conductance is obtained, thus strongly supporting the correlated nature of this non-equilibrium&#160;resonance.</p>",[],True,"[""J.

letter,Controlling the motion of cold molecules with deep periodic optical potentials,"<p>The application of optical forces has allowed unprecedented control over the motion of atoms leading to laser cooling and trapping and Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation. More recently, the manipulation of cold neutral polar molecules using electrostatic fields has been used to create slow cold molecules in the laboratory frame. Here, we report on the controlled manipulation of molecules using deep periodic optical lattice potentials (22&#8201;K) created by intense optical fields (10<sup>11</sup>&#8201;W&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>). By using the oscillatory motion of nitric oxide molecules in these potentials, we have demonstrated rapid deceleration or acceleration in a molecular beam to well-defined velocities on a length scale of less than 535&#8201;nm. We reduce the kinetic energy of the molecules in a cold molecular beam by up to 50% in a single laser pulse (5.8&#8201;ns) demonstrating precise control of molecular-beam velocity and a new method for creating slow cold molecules using optical&#160;fields.</p>",[],True,"[""R.

letter,Magneto-elastic lattice collapse in YCo5,"<p>The isomorphic collapse of crystalline lattices under pressure is a rare and intriguing phenomenon&#8211;the most famous examples being samarium sulphide and cerium metal. Both lattices are cubic under ambient conditions and collapse isomorphically under pressure, remaining cubic with &#8764;15% volume reduction. In SmS the transition results from a change of the 4f chemical valence. The collapse in Ce is connected with the altering contributions of the 4f electrons to the chemical bonding, the details of which are currently much debated. In contrast, YCo<sub>5</sub> is a hexagonal metallic compound with a stable valence and no 4f electrons. Here, we present a combination of high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements and density functional electronic-structure calculations to demonstrate an entirely different type of isomorphic transition under hydrostatic pressure of 19&#8201;GPa. Our results suggest that the lattice collapse is driven by magnetic interactions and can be characterized as a first-order Lifshitz transition, where the Fermi surface changes topologically.

letter,Direct force measurements on DNA in a solid-state nanopore,"<p>Among the variety of roles for nanopores in biology, an important one is enabling polymer transport, for example in gene transfer between bacteria and transport of RNA through the nuclear membrane. Recently, this has inspired the use of protein and solid-state nanopores as single-molecule sensors for the detection and structural analysis of DNA and RNA by voltage-driven translocation. The magnitude of the force involved is of fundamental importance in understanding and exploiting this translocation mechanism, yet so far it has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate the first measurements of the force on a single DNA molecule in a solid-state nanopore by combining optical tweezers with ionic-current detection. The opposing force exerted by the optical tweezers can be used to slow down and even arrest the translocation of the DNA molecules. We obtain a value of 0.24&#177;0.02&#8201;pN&#160;mV<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for the force on a single DNA molecule, independent of salt concentration from 0.02 to 1&#8201;M&#8201;KCl.

article,In situ evidence for the structure of the magnetic null in a 3D reconnection event in the Earth's magnetotail,"<p>Magnetic reconnection is one of the most important processes in astrophysical, space and laboratory plasmas. Identifying the structure around the point at which the magnetic field lines break and subsequently reform, known as the magnetic null point, is crucial to improving our understanding of reconnection. But owing to the inherently three-dimensional nature of this process, magnetic nulls are only detectable through measurements obtained simultaneously from at least four points in space. Using data collected by the four spacecraft of the Cluster constellation as they traversed a diffusion region in the Earth's magnetotail on 15 September 2001, we report here the first in situ evidence for the structure of an isolated magnetic null. The results indicate that it has a positive-spiral structure whose spatial extent is of the same order as the local ion inertial length scale, suggesting that the Hall effect could play an important role in 3D reconnection&#160;dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

article,Ultrafast photonic crystal nanocavity laser,"<p>Spontaneous emission is not inherent to an emitter, but rather depends on its electromagnetic environment. In a microcavity, the spontaneous emission rate can be greatly enhanced compared with that in free space. This so-called Purcell effect can dramatically increase laser modulation speeds, although to date no time-domain measurements have demonstrated this. Here we show extremely fast photonic crystal nanocavity lasers with response times as short as a few picoseconds resulting from 75-fold spontaneous emission rate enhancement in the cavity. We demonstrate direct modulation speeds far exceeding 100&#8201;GHz (limited by the detector response time), already more than an order of magnitude above the fastest semiconductor lasers.
