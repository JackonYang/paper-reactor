letter,Real-time observation of nonlinear coherent phonon dynamics in single-walled carbon nanotubes,"<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are &#960;-conjugated, quasi-one-dimensional structures consisting of rolled-up graphene sheets that, depending on their chirality, behave as semiconductors or metals; owing to their unique properties, they enable groundbreaking applications in mechanics, nanoelectronics and photonics. In semiconducting SWNTs, medium-sized excitons (3&#8211;5&#8201;nm) with large binding energy and oscillator strength are the fundamental excitations; exciton wavefunction localization and one-dimensionality give rise to a strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling, the study of which is crucial for the understanding of their electronic and optical properties. Here we report on the use of resonant sub-10-fs visible pulses to generate and detect, in the time domain, coherent phonons in SWNT ensembles. We observe vibrational wavepackets for the radial breathing mode (RBM) and the G mode, and in particular their anharmonic coupling, resulting in a frequency modulation of the G mode by the RBM. Quantum-chemical modelling shows that this effect is due to a corrugation of the SWNT surface on photoexcitation, leading to a coupling between longitudinal and radial vibrations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica, CNR-INFM, National Laboratory for Ultrafast and Ultraintense Optical Science, Politecnico di Milano, P.za L. da Vinci 32, 20133, Milan, Italy', 'authors': ['A.

letter,Analogues of nonlinear optics using terahertz Josephson plasma waves in layered superconductors,"<p>Electromagnetic waves in layered superconductors are known as Josephson plasma waves (JPWs). An important property of JPWs is the gap in their energy spectrum: JPWs can propagate if the frequency &#969; is above the Josephson plasma frequency &#969;<sub>J</sub> (refs&#160;), which being in the terahertz (THz) range, is important for applications. This feature is fuelling a growing interest in studies of JPWs (see, for example, refs&#160;&#8211;). However, nonlinear (NL) JPWs have not yet been studied. It is a challenge to understand nonlinearities around the plasma frequency, where the interplay between the unusual spectrum and the nonlinearity of the JPWs is most pronounced. Here, we predict the propagation of NL JPWs with frequencies below &#969;<sub>J</sub>, which is unusual for plasma-like excitations. In analogy to NL optics, these waves exhibit numerous remarkable features, including the slowing down of light (when the group velocity &#8706; &#969;/&#8706; k&#8776;0), self-focusing effects and the pumping of weaker waves by stronger ones. The nonlinearity for &#969;&gt;&#969;<sub>J</sub> can potentially be used for transforming continuous THz radiation into amplified pulses.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Frontier Research System, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Wako-shi, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan', 'authors': ['Sergey Savel’ev', ',\xa0A.

letter,Dynamic particle tracking reveals the ageing temperature of a colloidal glass,"<p>The glass transition is considered to be one of the most fundamental problems in statistical physics. Despite decades of effort, a general consensus on the validity of a universal theory for the large variety of glass systems is lacking&#8212;partly because of difficulties encountered in the experimental testing of the theoretical predictions. Here, we present experiments on a colloidal glass made of micrometre-sized particles in a fluid. We investigate the autocorrelation and response function to monitor the ageing of a colloidal glass. At equilibrium, all the observables are stationary, whereas in the out-of-equilibrium glassy state they have an explicit dependence on the age of the system. We find that the transport coefficients scale with the ageing time as a power law, a signature of the slow relaxation. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals that the glassy system has thermalized at a constant temperature independent of the age and warmer than the bath, reflecting the structural rearrangements of cage dynamics. Furthermore, we find a universal scaling law to describe the global and local fluctuations of the observables.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Levich Institute and Physics Department, City College of New York, New York, 10031, USA', 'authors': ['Ping Wang', ',\xa0Chaoming Song', '\xa0&\xa0Hernán A.

letter,Effects of topology on network evolution,"<p>The ubiquity of scale-free topology in nature raises the question of whether this particular network design confers an evolutionary advantage. A series of studies has identified key principles controlling the growth and the dynamics of scale-free networks. Here, we use neuron-based networks of boolean components as a framework for modelling a large class of dynamical behaviours in both natural and artificial systems. Applying a training algorithm, we characterize how networks with distinct topologies evolve towards a pre-established target function through a process of random mutations and selection. We find that homogeneous random networks and scale-free networks exhibit drastically different evolutionary paths. Whereas homogeneous random networks accumulate neutral mutations and evolve by sparse punctuated steps, scale-free networks evolve rapidly and continuously. Remarkably, this latter property is robust to variations of the degree exponent. In contrast, homogeneous random networks require a specific tuning of their connectivity to optimize their ability to evolve. These results highlight an organizing principle that governs the evolution of complex networks and that can improve the design of engineered&#160;systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, The James Franck Institute and Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, University of Chicago, Gordon Center for Integrative Science, 929 E. 57th St, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA', 'authors': ['Panos Oikonomou', '\xa0&\xa0Philippe Cluzel']}]",True,"['Panos Oikonomou', 'Philippe Cluzel']","Oikonomou, P., Cluzel, P.

article,Two energy scales and two distinct quasiparticle dynamics in the superconducting state of underdoped cuprates,"<p>The superconducting temperature T<sub>c</sub> of hole-doped high-temperature superconductors has a dome-like shape as a function of hole concentration, with a maximum T<sub>c</sub> at &#8216;optimal&#8217; doping. On the underdoped side, the superconducting state is often described in terms of one energy scale, associated with the maximum of the d-wave gap (at the antinodes), which increases as the doping decreases. Here, we report electronic Raman scattering experiments that show a second energy scale in the gap function: the slope of the gap at the nodes, which decreases with decreasing doping. Our measurements also reveal two distinct quasiparticle dynamics; electronic coherence persists down to low doping levels at the nodes, whereas antinodal quasiparticles become incoherent. Using a sum-rule, we find that the low-frequency Raman response and the temperature dependence of the superfluid density, both controlled by nodal excitations, behave in a qualitatively similar manner with doping variation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire Matériaux et Phénomènes Quantiques (UMR 7162 CNRS), Université Paris 7, 2 place Jussieu, 75251, Paris, France', 'authors': ['M.

article,Superconductivity in CuxTiSe2,"<p>Charge density waves (CDWs) are periodic modulations of the density of conduction electrons in solids. They are collective states that arise from intrinsic instabilities often present in low-dimensional electronic systems. The most well-studied examples are the layered dichalcogenides&#8211;an example of which is TiSe<sub>2</sub>, one of the first CDW-bearing materials to be discovered. At low temperatures, a widely held belief is that the CDW competes with another collective electronic state, superconductivity. But despite much exploration, a detailed study of this competition is lacking. Here we report how, on controlled intercalation of TiSe<sub>2</sub> with Cu to yield Cu<sub>x</sub>TiSe<sub>2</sub>, the CDW transition can be continuously suppressed, and a new superconducting state emerges near x=0.04, with a maximum transition temperature T<sub>c</sub> of 4.15&#8201;K at x=0.08.

article,Interaction between optical nano-objects at metallo-dielectric interfaces,"<p>The light interactions between subwavelength apertures in metallic screens represent a basic diffraction phenomenon that has been studied for a long time. Initial reports have promoted the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) as the main vector responsible for the interaction. However, recent experimental results largely question this point of view and favour an interaction based on a new type of surface wave. Here we provide a comprehensive study of the different mechanisms involved in the electromagnetic interaction between optical nano-objects such as slits and holes at metallo-dielectric interfaces. We show that the interaction is driven by two very different near-field contributions, the SPP mode of the interface and a creeping wave. Although their relative impact strongly depends on the frequency range of interest and on the actual geometry of the nano-objects, SPPs are shown to be the primary vector of the interaction at visible frequencies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire Charles Fabry de l’Institut d’Optique, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, F-91403, Orsay cedex, France', 'authors': ['P.

article,The effect of Auger heating on intraband carrier relaxation in semiconductor quantum rods,"<p>The rate at which excited charge carriers relax to their equilibrium state affects many aspects of the performance of nanoscale devices, including switching speed, carrier mobility and luminescence efficiency. A better understanding of the processes that govern carrier relaxation therefore has important technological implications. A significant increase in carrier&#8211;carrier interactions caused by strong spatial confinement of electronic excitations in semiconductor nanostructures leads to a considerable enhancement of Auger effects, which can further result in unusual, Auger-process-controlled recombination and energy relaxation regimes. Here, we report the first experimental observation of efficient Auger heating in CdSe quantum rods at high pump intensities, leading to a strong reduction of carrier cooling rates. In this regime, the carrier temperature is determined by the balance between energy outflow through phonon emission and energy inflow because of Auger heating. This equilibrium results in peculiar carrier cooling dynamics that closely correlate with recombination dynamics, an effect never seen before in bulk or nanoscale&#160;semiconductors.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Chemistry Division, C-PCS, MS-J567, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, 87545, USA', 'authors': ['Marc Achermann', ',\xa0Andrew P.

article,Reynolds number effects on Rayleigh–Taylor instability with possible implications for type Ia supernovae,"<p>Spontaneous mixing of fluids at unstably stratified interfaces occurs in a wide variety of atmospheric, oceanic, geophysical and astrophysical flows. The Rayleigh&#8211;Taylor instability, a process by which fluids seek to reduce their combined potential energy, plays a key role in all types of fusion. Despite decades of investigation, fundamental questions regarding turbulent Rayleigh&#8211;Taylor flow persist, namely: does the flow forget its initial conditions, is the flow self-similar, what is the scaling constant, and how does mixing influence the growth rate? Here, we show results from a large direct numerical simulation addressing such questions. The simulated flow reaches a Reynolds number of 32,000, far exceeding that of all previous Rayleigh&#8211;Taylor simulations. We find that the scaling constant cannot be found by fitting a curve to the width of the mixing layer (as is common practice) but can be obtained by recourse to the similarity equation for the expansion rate of the turbulent region. Moreover, the ratio of kinetic energy to released potential energy is not constant, but exhibits a weak Reynolds number dependence, which might have profound consequences for flame propagation models in type Ia supernova&#160;simulations.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Ave., Livermore, California, 94550-9234, USA', 'authors': ['William H.
