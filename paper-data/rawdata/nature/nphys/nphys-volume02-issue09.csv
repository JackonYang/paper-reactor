letter,First direct observation of Dirac fermions in graphite,"<p>Originating from relativistic quantum field theory, Dirac fermions have been invoked recently to explain various peculiar phenomena in condensed-matter physics, including the novel quantum Hall effect in graphene, the magnetic-field-driven metal&#8211;insulator-like transition in graphite, superfluidity in <sup>3</sup>He (ref.&#160;) and the exotic pseudogap phase of high-temperature superconductors. Despite their proposed key role in those systems, direct experimental evidence of Dirac fermions has been limited. Here, we report the first direct observation of relativistic Dirac fermions with linear dispersion near the Brillouin zone (BZ) corner H, which coexist with quasiparticles that have a parabolic dispersion near another BZ corner K. In addition, we also report a large electron pocket that we attribute to defect-induced localized states. Thus, graphite presents a system in which massless Dirac fermions, quasiparticles with finite effective mass and defect states all contribute to the low-energy electronic dynamics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, California, 94720, USA', 'authors': ['S.

letter,Magnetic energy change available to superconducting condensation in optimally doped YBa2Cu3O6.95,"<p>Understanding the magnetic excitations in high-temperature (high-T<sub>c</sub>) copper-oxide superconductors is important because they may mediate the electron pairing for superconductivity. By determining the wavevector (Q) and energy (&#295;&#969;) dependence of the magnetic excitations, it is possible to calculate the change in the exchange energy available to the superconducting condensation energy.

letter,Nonlinear optical signatures of the tensor order in Cd2Re2O7,"<p>Growing evidence indicates that the superconducting pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> exhibits a structural phase transition at T<sub>c</sub>=200&#8201;K with an unusual tensor character. The structural order parameter for this state is two-dimensional, and spanned by distinct but nearly degenerate crystallographic structures I4<sub>1</sub>22 and  (ref.&#160;). Symmetry rules imply that the low-energy excitations of the ordered state are Goldstone phonons, or long wavelength fluctuations between the two crystal structures. These are the structural equivalents of magnons in an XY antiferromagnet, with the two crystal structures analogous to orthogonal spin directions in the xy-plane. Goldstone phonons have been observed in Raman spectroscopy, but high-resolution X-ray and neutron scattering experiments have produced conflicting assignments of the static low-temperature structure. Here, we use optical second-harmonic generation with polarization sensitivity to assign the  structure unambiguously and verify an auxiliary condition on the structure that is implied by the order parameter symmetry. We also show that the temperature dependence of the order parameter is consistent with thermal occupation of the Goldstone mode.

letter,Zero-bias spin separation,"<p>The generation, manipulation and detection of spin-polarized electrons in low-dimensional semiconductors are at the heart of spintronics. Pure spin currents, that is, fluxes of magnetization without charge current, are quite attractive in this respect. A paradigmatic example is the spin Hall effect, where an electrical current drives a transverse spin current and causes a non-equilibrium spin accumulation observed near the sample boundary. Here we provide evidence for an another effect causing spin currents which is fundamentally different from the spin Hall effect. In contrast to the spin Hall effect, it does not require an electric current to flow: without bias the spin separation is achieved by spin-dependent scattering of electrons in media with suitable symmetry. We show, by free-carrier absorption of terahertz (THz) radiation, that spin currents flow in a wide range of temperatures. Moreover, the experimental results provide evidence that simple electron gas heating by any means is already sufficient to yield spin separation due to spin-dependent energy-relaxation processes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Fakultät Physik, Universität Regensburg, 93040, Regensburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Sergey D.

article,Cosmic-ray diffusion near the Bohm limit in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant,"<p>The acceleration of cosmic rays in our Galaxy by means of diffusive shock (Fermi) acceleration is believed to occur primarily in supernova remnants (SNRs). Despite considerable theoretical work, the precise details are still unknown, in part because of the difficulty in directly observing nucleons that are accelerated to TeV energies in&#8212;and affect the structure of&#8212;SNR shocks. However, for the past ten years, X-ray observatories such as ASCA (Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics) and, more recently, Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku, have made it possible to image the keV-scale synchrotron emission produced by cosmic-ray electrons accelerated in SNR shocks. Here, we describe a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of Chandra observations of the Galactic SNR Cassiopeia A to map the cutoff frequencies of electrons accelerated in the forward shock. We set upper limits on the diffusion coefficient and find locations where particles seem to be accelerated nearly as fast as theoretically possible (the Bohm limit).</p>",,"[{'address': 'Five College Astronomy Department, University of Massachusetts, 710 North Pleasant Street, Amherst, Massachusetts, 01003-9305, USA', 'authors': ['M.

article,Chiral tunnelling and the Klein paradox in graphene,"<p>The so-called Klein paradox&#8212;unimpeded penetration of relativistic particles through high and wide potential barriers&#8212;is one of the most exotic and counterintuitive consequences of quantum electrodynamics. The phenomenon is discussed in many contexts in particle, nuclear and astro-physics but direct tests of the Klein paradox using elementary particles have so far proved impossible. Here we show that the effect can be tested in a conceptually simple condensed-matter experiment using electrostatic barriers in single- and bi-layer graphene. Owing to the chiral nature of their quasiparticles, quantum tunnelling in these materials becomes highly anisotropic, qualitatively different from the case of normal, non-relativistic electrons. Massless Dirac fermions in graphene allow a close realization of Klein&#8217;s gedanken experiment, whereas massive chiral fermions in bilayer graphene offer an interesting complementary system that elucidates the basic physics involved.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University Nijmegen, 6525, ED Nijmegen, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['M.

article,The 'strange metal' is a projected Fermi liquid with edge singularities,"<p>The first measurements on single-crystalline high-temperature superconductors revealed that the &#8216;normal&#8217; metal above the superconducting transition temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, was as unusual as the superconductor: the large, temperature-dependent resistivity implied a scattering rate not just linear in T but of the order of the average excitation energy k<sub>B</sub>T/h, where k<sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann&#8217;s constant and h is Planck&#8217;s constant. This &#8216;strange metal&#8217; phase continues to be of much theoretical interest. Here we show it is a consequence of projecting the doubly occupied amplitudes out of a conventional Fermi-sea wavefunction (Gutzwiller projection), requiring no exotica such as a mysterious quantum critical point. Exploiting a formal similarity with the classic problem of Fermi-edge singularities in the X-ray spectra of metals, we find a Fermi-liquid-like excitation spectrum, but the excitations are asymmetric between electrons and holes, show anomalous forward scattering and the renormalization constant Z=0. We explain the power-law frequency dependence of the conductivity, and predict tunnelling spectrum anomalies and the forms of photoelectron&#160;spectra.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, 08544, USA', 'authors': ['P.

article,Exciton scattering and localization in branched dendrimeric structures,"<p>&#960;-conjugated dendrimers are molecular examples of tree-like structures known in physics as Bethe lattices. Electronic excitations in these systems can be spatially delocalized or localized depending on the branching topology. Without a priori knowledge of the localization pattern, understanding photoexcitation dynamics reflected in experimental optical spectra is difficult. &#8216;Supramolecular&#8217;-like quantum-chemical calculations quickly become intractable as the molecular size increases. Here we develop a reduced exciton-scattering (ES) model, which attributes excited states to standing waves in quasi-one-dimensional structures, assuming a quasiparticle picture of optical excitations. Direct quantum-chemical calculations of branched phenylacetylene chromophores are used to verify our model and to derive relevant parameters. Complex and non-trivial delocalization patterns of photoexcitations throughout the entire molecular tree can then be universally characterized and understood using the proposed ES method, completely bypassing &#8216;supramolecular&#8217; calculations.
