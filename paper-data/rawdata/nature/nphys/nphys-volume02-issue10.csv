But efforts to solve the problem have since led to profound and revolutionary new insights into the quantum structure of space&#8211;time.

letter,Experimental quantum teleportation of a two-qubit composite system,"<p>Quantum teleportation, a way to transfer the state of a quantum system from one location to another, is central to quantum communication and plays an important role in a number of quantum computation protocols. Previous experimental demonstrations have been implemented with single photonic or ionic qubits. However, teleportation of single qubits is insufficient for a large-scale realization of quantum communication and computation. Here, we present the experimental realization of quantum teleportation of a two-qubit composite system. In the experiment, we develop and exploit a six-photon interferometer to teleport an arbitrary polarization state of two photons. The observed teleportation fidelities for different initial states are all well beyond the state estimation limit of 0.40 for a two-qubit system. Not only does our six-photon interferometer provide an important step towards teleportation of a complex system, it will also enable future experimental investigations on a number of fundamental quantum communication and computation protocols.</p>",[],True,"[""Qiang Zhang"", ""Alexander Goebel"", ""Claudia Wagenknecht"", ""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Bo Zhao"", ""Tao Yang"", ""Alois Mair"", ""J\u00f6rg Schmiedmayer"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Zhang, Q., Goebel, A., Wagenknecht, C. et al.

letter,Observation of the Nernst signal generated by fluctuating Cooper pairs,"<p>Long-range order is destroyed in a superconductor warmed above its critical temperature (T<sub>c</sub>). However, amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter survive and lead to a number of well-established phenomena, such as paraconductivity: an excess of charge conductivity due to the presence of short-lived Cooper pairs in the normal state. According to theory, these pairs generate a transverse thermoelectric (Nernst) signal. In two dimensions, the magnitude of the expected signal depends only on universal constants and the superconducting coherence length, so the theory can be rigorously tested. Here, we present measurements of amorphous superconducting films of Nb<sub>0.15</sub>Si<sub>0.85</sub>. In this dirty superconductor, the lifetime of Cooper pairs exceeds the elastic scattering lifetime of quasiparticles in a wide temperature range above T<sub>c</sub> and, consequently, their Nernst response dominates that generated by the normal electrons. We resolved a Nernst signal, which persists deep inside the normal state. Its amplitude is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. This result provides an unambiguous case for a Nernst effect produced by short-lived Cooper pairs.</p>",[],True,"[""A. Pourret"", ""H. Aubin"", ""J. Lesueur"", ""C. A. Marrache-Kikuchi"", ""L.

letter,Measurement of the quantum capacitance of interacting electrons in carbon nanotubes,"<p>The electronic capacitance of a one-dimensional system such as a carbon nanotube is a thermodynamic quantity that contains fundamental information about the ground state. It is composed of an electrostatic component describing the interactions between electrons and their correlations, and a kinetic term given by the electronic density of states. Here, we use a field-effect transistor geometry to obtain the first direct capacitance measurement of individual carbon nanotubes, as a function of the carrier density. Our measurements detect the electrostatic part of the capacitance as well as the quantum corrections arising from the electronic density of states. We identify the van-Hove singularities that correspond to the one-dimensional electron and hole sub-bands and show that the measured capacitance exhibits clear electron&#8211;hole symmetry. Finally, our measurements suggest the existence of a negative capacitance, which has recently been predicted to exist in one dimension as a result of interactions between electrons.</p>",[],True,"[""S.

letter,Preparation of a quantum state with one molecule at each site of an optical lattice,"<p>Ultracold gases in optical lattices are of great interest, because these systems bear great potential for applications in quantum simulations and quantum information processing, in particular when using particles with a long-range dipole&#8211;dipole interaction, such as polar molecules. Here we show the preparation of a quantum state with exactly one molecule at each site of an optical lattice. The molecules are produced from an atomic Mott insulator with a density profile chosen such that the central region of the gas contains two atoms per lattice site. A Feshbach resonance is used to associate the atom pairs to molecules. The remaining atoms can be removed with blast light. The technique does not rely on the molecule&#8211;molecule interaction properties and is therefore applicable to many systems.</p>",[],True,"[""T. Volz"", ""N. Syassen"", ""D. M. Bauer"", ""E.

letter,GeV electron beams from a centimetre-scale accelerator,"<p>Gigaelectron volt (GeV) electron accelerators are essential to synchrotron radiation facilities and free-electron lasers, and as modules for high-energy particle physics. Radiofrequency-based accelerators are limited to relatively low accelerating fields (10&#8211;50&#8201;MV&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>), requiring tens to hundreds of metres to reach the multi-GeV beam energies needed to drive radiation sources, and many kilometres to generate particle energies of interest to high-energy physics. Laser-wakefield accelerators produce electric fields of the order 10&#8211;100&#8201;GV&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> enabling compact devices. Previously, the required laser intensity was not maintained over the distance needed to reach GeV energies, and hence acceleration was limited to the 100 MeV scale. Contrary to predictions that petawatt-class lasers would be needed to reach GeV energies, here we demonstrate production of a high-quality electron beam with 1&#8201;GeV energy by channelling a 40&#8201;TW peak-power laser pulse in a 3.3-cm-long gas-filled capillary discharge&#160;waveguide.</p>",[],True,"[""W.

letter,Observation of subnanometre-high surface topography with X-ray reflection phase-contrast microscopy,"<p>The direct observation of molecular-scale features has been the exclusive realm of electron and probe microscopies, whereas X-ray imaging has been limited to the observation of objects greater than 10&#8201;nm in size associated with the resolution of X-ray optics. Here, we describe a novel approach that extends hard X-ray microscopy to image the distribution of molecular-scale interfacial features directly and non-invasively with full-field imaging. Interfacial phase contrast from elementary defect structures allows direct observation of 0.6-nm-high monomolecular steps at a solid surface. This non-invasive technique opens up new opportunities to study interfacial processes in&#160;situ and in real time, particularly those taking place under aggressive chemical conditions, which currently can only be studied by ex&#160;situ approaches.</p>",[],True,"[""Paul Fenter"", ""Changyong Park"", ""Zhan Zhang"", ""Steve Wang""]","Fenter, P., Park, C., Zhang, Z. et al.

article,Full quantum distribution of contrast in interference experiments between interacting one-dimensional Bose liquids,"<p>The existence of quantum noise is the most direct evidence for the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. In strongly interacting systems we expect quantum noise to reveal non-local correlations of the underlying many-body states. Here, we show that quantum noise in interference experiments with cold atoms can be used to investigate the unusual character of one-dimensional interacting systems. We analyse interference experiments for a pair of independent bosonic one-dimensional condensates and explicitly calculate the distribution function of fringe amplitudes using methods of conformal field theory. Moreover, we point out interesting relations between interference experiments with cold atoms, the problem of a quantum impurity in a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid and a variety of statistical models ranging from stochastic growth models to two-dimensional quantum gravity. Such connections can be exploited to design a quantum simulator of unusual two-dimensional models described by non-unitary conformal field theories with negative central charges.</p>",[],False,"[""Vladimir Gritsev"", ""Ehud Altman"", ""Eugene Demler"", ""Anatoli Polkovnikov""]","Gritsev, V., Altman, E., Demler, E. et al.

article,Radiofrequency-dressed-state potentials for neutral atoms,"<p>Potentials for atoms can be created by external fields acting on properties such as magnetic moment, charge, polarizability, or by oscillating fields that couple internal states. The most prominent realization of the latter is the optical dipole potential formed by coupling ground and electronically excited states of an atom with light. Here, we present an extensive experimental analysis of potentials derived from radiofrequency (RF) coupling of electronic ground states. The coupling is magnetic and the vector character allows the design of versatile microscopic state-dependent potential landscapes. Compared with standard magnetic trapping, we find no additional heating or (collisional) loss up to densities of 10<sup>15</sup>&#8201;atoms&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup>. We demonstrate robust evaporative cooling in RF potentials, which allows easy production of Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates in complex potentials. Altogether, this makes RF dressing a new powerful tool for manipulating ultracold atoms complementary to magnetic trapping and optical dipole potentials.</p>",[],False,"[""S. Hofferberth"", ""I.
