letter,Tunable refraction and reflection of self-confined light beams,"<p>Light filaments or optical spatial solitons are self-confined (non-spreading) beams that originate from the balance between diffraction and self-focusing in nonlinear optical media (those with a response dependent on the level of excitation). Owing to their ability to self-trap as well as to guide weaker signals (even if differing in colour or modulation format) within the waveguides or &#8216;light-pipes&#8217; they induce, optical spatial solitons could form the basis of future all-optical processing networks. One of the most interesting challenges in soliton propagation and engineering concerns light filaments incident on linear/nonlinear or nonlinear/nonlinear interfaces. Here we report the robust propagation, refraction and reflection of optical spatial solitons at the interface between two regions of a nematic liquid crystal. The ability to independently tune the optical properties of each region enables us to steer the beams by refraction and total internal reflection by as much as &#8722;18 and +22 degrees, respectively. Moreover, the extended (nonlocal) and anisotropic response of our system supports polarization healing of the solitons across the interface as well as non-specular filament reflection. Finally, exploiting the inherent and all-optically tunable birefringence, we demonstrate unprecedented nonlinear Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen lateral shifts in excess of 0.5&#8201;mm.</p>",[],True,"[""Marco Peccianti"", ""Andriy Dyadyusha"", ""Malgosia Kaczmarek"", ""Gaetano Assanto""]","Peccianti, M., Dyadyusha, A., Kaczmarek, M. et al.

letter,Phonons in a one-dimensional microfluidic crystal,"<p>The development of a general theoretical framework for describing the behaviour of a crystal driven far from equilibrium has proved difficult. Microfluidic crystals, formed by the introduction of droplets of immiscible fluid into a liquid-filled channel, provide a convenient means to explore and develop models to describe non-equilibrium dynamics. Owing to the fact that these systems operate at low Reynolds number (Re), in which viscous dissipation of energy dominates inertial effects, vibrations are expected to be over-damped and contribute little to their dynamics. Against such expectations, we report the emergence of collective normal vibrational modes (equivalent to acoustic &#8216;phonons&#8217;) in a one-dimensional microfluidic crystal of water-in-oil droplets at Re&#8764;10<sup>&#8722;4</sup>. These phonons propagate at an ultra-low sound velocity of &#8764;100&#8201;&#956;m&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and frequencies of a few hertz, exhibit unusual dispersion relations markedly different to those of harmonic crystals, and give rise to a variety of crystal instabilities that could have implications for the design of commercial microfluidic systems. First-principles theory shows that these phonons are an outcome of the symmetry-breaking flow field that induces long-range inter-droplet interactions, similar in nature to those observed in many other systems including dusty plasma crystals, vortices in superconductors, active membranes and nucleoprotein&#160;filaments.</p>",[],True,"[""Tsevi Beatus"", ""Tsvi Tlusty"", ""Roy Bar-Ziv""]","Beatus, T., Tlusty, T. & Bar-Ziv, R.

letter,Snapshots of laser wakefields,"<p>Tabletop plasma accelerators can now produce GeV-range electron beams and femtosecond X-ray pulses, providing compact radiation sources for medicine, nuclear engineering, materials science and high-energy physics. In these accelerators, electrons surf on electric fields exceeding 100&#8201;GeV&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than achievable in conventional accelerators. These fields are generated within plasma structures (such as Langmuir waves or electron density &#8216;bubbles&#8217;) propagating near light speed behind laser or charged-particle driving pulses.

article,Entanglement and the foundations of statistical mechanics,"<p>Statistical mechanics is one of the most successful areas of physics. Yet, almost 150 years since its inception, its foundations and basic postulates are still the subject of debate. Here we suggest that the main postulate of statistical mechanics, the equal a priori probability postulate, should be abandoned as misleading and unnecessary. We argue that it should be replaced by a general canonical principle, whose physical content is fundamentally different from the postulate it replaces: it refers to individual states, rather than to ensemble or time averages. Furthermore, whereas the original postulate is an unprovable assumption, the principle we propose is mathematically proven. The key element in this proof is the quantum entanglement between the system and its environment. Our approach separates the issue of finding the canonical state from finding out how close a system is to it, allowing us to go even beyond the usual boltzmannian&#160;situation.</p>",[],False,"[""Sandu Popescu"", ""Anthony J.

article,Unconventional motional narrowing in the optical spectrum of a semiconductor quantum dot,"<p>&#8216;Motional narrowing&#8217; refers to the striking phenomenon where the resonance line of a system coupled to a reservoir becomes narrower on increasing the reservoir fluctuation. A textbook example is found in nuclear magnetic resonance, where the fluctuating local magnetic fields created by randomly oriented nuclear spins are averaged when the motion of the nuclei is thermally activated. The existence of a motional-narrowing effect in the optical response of semiconductor quantum dots remains so far unexplored. This effect may be important in this instance because the decoherence dynamics is a central issue for the implementation of quantum information processing based on quantum dots. Here we report on the experimental evidence of motional narrowing in the optical spectrum of a semiconductor quantum dot broadened by the spectral-diffusion phenomenon. Surprisingly, motional narrowing is achieved when decreasing incident power or temperature, in contrast with the standard phenomenology observed for nuclear magnetic resonance.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Demagnetization cooling of a gas,"<p>Adiabatic demagnetization is an efficient technique for cooling solid samples by several orders of magnitude in a single cooling step. In gases, the required coupling between dipolar moments and motion is typically too weak, but in dipolar gases&#8212;of high-spin atoms or heteronuclear molecules with strong electric dipole moments, for example&#8212;the method should be applicable. Here, we demonstrate demagnetization cooling of a gas of ultracold <sup>52</sup>Cr atoms. Demagnetization is driven by inelastic dipolar collisions, which couple the motional degrees of freedom to the spin degree. In this way, kinetic energy is converted into magnetic work, with a consequent temperature reduction of the gas. Optical pumping is used to magnetize the system and drive continuous demagnetization cooling. We can increase the phase-space density of our sample by up to one order of magnitude, with almost no atom loss, suggesting that the method could be used to achieve quantum degeneracy via optical means.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

article,Long-range interactions between optical solitons,"<p>Solitons are self-localized wave packets arising from a robust balance between dispersion and nonlinearity. They are a universal phenomenon, exhibiting properties typically associated with particles. Thus far, interactions between solitons have been observed only between neighbouring solitons at close proximity. Here, we study interactions between solitons in highly non-local nonlinear media, and demonstrate experimentally attraction between solitons propagating in different samples, where their optical fields never overlap and the interaction is mediated solely by a non-optical wire. This increases the soliton interaction range by orders of magnitude, and breaks the close-proximity and nearest-neighbour limitations on soliton interactions. We also experiment with three-dimensional interactions between solitons that are far apart, where the solitons capture each other into a spiralling motion with a circular orbit, and a tangential velocity that does not depend on the separation between solitons. Our study suggests that these phenomena could be used in the construction of novel model systems for studying the behaviour of complex nonlinear networks.</p>",[],False,"[""Carmel Rotschild"", ""Barak Alfassi"", ""Oren Cohen"", ""Mordechai Segev""]","Rotschild, C., Alfassi, B., Cohen, O. et al.

article,Dispersionless slow light using gap solitons,"<p>The ability to slow down and delay optical pulses is an intriguing physical phenomenon with significant applications, such as in telecommunications. It is essential for these applications that the phenomenon has enough bandwidth, so that it can respond sufficiently fast to the very short light pulses that will carry the information in future telecommunications systems. However, typical slow-light systems exhibit dispersion, which distorts the pulses on propagation, leading to loss of information, thereby limiting the bandwidth. This limitation imposes a trade-off between the acquired delay and the system&#8217;s bandwidth. By introducing nonlinearity, however, the pulse can travel slowly and also remain undistorted over arbitrarily long propagation lengths by the formation of a soliton. We observe such solitons in a fibre Bragg grating, and show that subnanosecond pulses travel at 16% of the speed of light, without broadening.</p>",[],False,"[""Joe T. Mok"", ""C.

article,Measuring and controlling the birth of attosecond XUV pulses,"<p>Generating attosecond pulses has required a radically different approach from previous ultrafast optical methods. The technology of attosecond measurement, however, is built on established methods of characterizing femtosecond pulses: the pulse is measured after it has left the region where it was produced. We offer a completely different approach: in situ measurement. That is, we integrate attosecond-pulse production and measurement in a manner that can be applied to many high-order nonlinear interactions. To demonstrate this approach, we combine a low-intensity (&lt;10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>) second-harmonic beam with the fundamental beam, to gently perturb the production process without significantly modifying it. The attosecond-pulse duration is read from the modulation of the even-harmonic signal as a function of the two-field delay. Increasing the second-harmonic intensity slightly (&lt;10<sup>&#8722;2</sup>), we extend measurement to control. We demonstrate control by manipulating the high-harmonic spectrum with high efficiency.</p>",[],False,"[""N. Dudovich"", ""O. Smirnova"", ""J. Levesque"", ""Y. Mairesse"", ""M. Yu. Ivanov"", ""D. M.
