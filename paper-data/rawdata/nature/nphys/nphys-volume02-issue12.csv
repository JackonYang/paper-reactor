review article,Shape phase transitions and critical-point phenomena in atomic nuclei,"<p>Atomic nuclei exhibit phase transitions as a function of the number of their constituent protons and neutrons. These phase transitions are not of the usual thermodynamic type, but rather they are quantum phase transitions in the equilibrium shape and structure of the ground and low-lying states. This realization has sparked a new area of research, focusing on the concept of 'critical-point symmetries', which describe the structure of nuclei at phase-transitional points. Both macroscopic (geometric or algebraic) and microscopic (shell-model) aspects of these phase transitions and of changes in structure with proton and neutron number in nuclei are discussed, along with an interpretation in terms of simple Landau theory. Finally, some alternative scenarios and schematic models for different classes of nuclei based on other simple potentials are briefly summarized.</p>",[],False,"[""R. F. Casten""]","Casten, R.

letter,Anisotropic scattering and anomalous normal-state transport in a high-temperature superconductor,"<p>The metallic state of high-temperature copper-oxide superconductors, characterized by unusual and distinct temperature dependences in the transport properties, is markedly different from that of textbook metals. Despite intense theoretical efforts, our limited understanding is impaired by our inability to determine experimentally the temperature and momentum dependence of the transport scattering rate. Here, we use a powerful magnetotransport probe to show that the resistivity and the Hall coefficient in highly doped Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>6+&#948;</sub> originate from two distinct inelastic scattering channels. One channel is due to conventional electron&#8211;electron scattering; the other is highly anisotropic, has the same symmetry as the superconducting gap and a magnitude that grows approximately linearly with temperature. The observed form and anisotropy place tight constraints on theories of the metallic state. Moreover, in heavily doped non-superconducting La<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, this anisotropic scattering term is absent, suggesting an intimate connection between the origin of this scattering and superconductivity itself.</p>",[],True,"[""M.

letter,Imaging and controlling electron transport inside a quantum ring,"<p>Traditionally, the understanding of quantum transport, coherent and ballistic, relies on the measurement of macroscopic properties such as the conductance. Although powerful when coupled to statistical theories, this approach cannot provide a detailed image of &#8216;how electrons behave down there&#8217;. Ideally, understanding transport at the nanoscale would require tracking each electron inside the nanodevice. Significant progress towards this goal was obtained by combining scanning probe microscopy with transport measurements. Some studies even showed signatures of quantum transport in the surroundings of nanostructures. Here, scanning probe microscopy is used to probe electron propagation inside an open quantum ring exhibiting the archetype of electron-wave interference phenomena: the Aharonov&#8211;Bohm effect. Conductance maps recorded while scanning the biased tip of a cryogenic atomic force microscope above the quantum ring show that the propagation of electrons, both coherent and ballistic, can be investigated in situ, and can even be controlled by tuning the potential felt by electrons at the nanoscale.</p>",[],True,"[""B.

letter,Initialization and read-out of spins in coupled core–shell quantum dots,"<p>In the field of quantum information science, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are of particular interest for their ability to confine a single electron for use as a qubit. However, to realize the potential offered by quantum information processing, it is necessary to couple two or more qubits. In contrast to coupling individual QDs, we demonstrate the integration of two coupled electronic states within a single QD heterostructure. These chemically synthesized nanocrystals, known as quantum-dot quantum wells (QDQWs), comprise concentric layers of different semiconducting materials. We investigate carrier and spin dynamics in these structures using transient absorption and time-resolved Faraday rotation measurements. By tuning the excitation and probe energies, we find that we can selectively initialize and read out spins in different coupled states within the QDQW. These results open a pathway for engineering coupled qubits within a single nanostructure.</p>",[],True,"[""J. Berezovsky"", ""O. Gywat"", ""F. Meier"", ""D. Battaglia"", ""X. Peng"", ""D. D.

letter,Electrical detection of coherent 31P spin quantum states,"<p>In recent years, a variety of solid-state qubits has been realized, including quantum dots, superconducting tunnel junctions and point defects. Owing to its potential compatibility with existing microelectronics, the proposal by Kane&#8212;on the basis of phosphorus donors in silicon&#8212;has been pursued intensively. A key issue of this concept is the readout of the <sup>31</sup>P quantum state. Electrical measurements of magnetic resonance have been carried out on single spins, but the statistical nature of these experiments based on random-telegraph-noise measurements has impeded the readout of single spin states. Here, we demonstrate the measurement of the spin state of <sup>31</sup>P donor electrons in silicon and the observation of Rabi flops by purely electric means, that is by coherent manipulation of spin-dependent charge-carrier recombination between the <sup>31</sup>P donor and paramagnetic localized states at the Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> interface. The electron spin information is shown to be coupled through the hyperfine interaction to the <sup>31</sup>P nucleus, suggesting that recombination-based readout of nuclear spins is feasible.</p>",[],True,"[""Andre R.

A novel X-ray camera assured single-photon detection sensitivity by filtering out parasitic scattering and plasma radiation. The reconstructed image, obtained directly from the coherent pattern by phase retrieval through oversampling, shows no measurable damage, and is reconstructed at the diffraction-limited resolution.

article,Conditional control of the quantum states of remote atomic memories for quantum networking,"<p>Quantum networks hold the promise for revolutionary advances in information processing with quantum resources distributed over remote locations via quantum-repeater architectures. Quantum networks are composed of nodes for storing and processing quantum states, and of channels for transmitting states between them. The scalability of such networks relies critically on the ability to carry out conditional operations on states stored in separated quantum memories. Here, we report the first implementation of such conditional control of two atomic memories, located in distinct apparatuses, which results in a 28-fold increase of the probability of simultaneously obtaining a pair of single photons, relative to the case without conditional control. As a first application, we demonstrate a high degree of indistinguishability for remotely generated single photons by the observation of destructive interference of their wave packets. Our results demonstrate experimentally a basic principle for enabling scalable quantum networks, with applications also to linear optics quantum computation.</p>",[],False,"[""D. Felinto"", ""C. W.

article,Strongly interacting polaritons in coupled arrays of cavities,"<p>Observing quantum phenomena in strongly correlated many-particle systems is difficult because of the short length- and timescales involved. Exerting control over the state of individual elements within such a system is even more so, and represents a hurdle in the realization of quantum computing devices. Substantial progress has been achieved with arrays of Josephson junctions and cold atoms in optical lattices, where detailed control over collective properties is feasible, but addressing individual sites remains a challenge. Here we show that a system of polaritons held in an array of resonant optical cavities&#8212;which could be realized using photonic crystals or toroidal microresonators&#8212;can form a strongly interacting many-body system showing quantum phase transitions, where individual particles can be controlled and measured.

article,Quantum phase transitions of light,"<p>The ability to conduct experiments at length scales and temperatures at which interesting and potentially useful quantum-mechanical phenomena emerge in condensed-matter or atomic systems is now commonplace. In optics, though, the weakness with which photons interact with each other makes exploring such behaviour more difficult. Here we describe an optical system that exhibits strongly correlated dynamics on a mesoscopic scale. By adding photons to a two-dimensional array of coupled optical cavities each containing a single two-level atom in the photon-blockade regime, we form dressed states, or polaritons, that are both long-lived and strongly interacting. Our results predict that at zero temperature the system will undergo a characteristic Mott insulator (excitations localized on each site) to superfluid (excitations delocalized across the lattice) quantum phase transition. Moreover, the ability to couple light to and from individual cavities of this system could be useful in the realization of tuneable quantum simulators and other quantum-mechanical devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Andrew D.
