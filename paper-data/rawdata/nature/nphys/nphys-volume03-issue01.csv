letter,Direct observation of the coherent precession of magnetic domain walls propagating along permalloy nanowires,"<p>The dynamics of the motion of domain walls (DWs) in magnetic materials has been extensively explored theoretically. Depending on the driving force, conventionally magnetic field and, more recently, spin-polarized current, the propagation of DWs changes from a simple translation to more complex precessional modes. Experimentally, indirect evidence of this transition is found from a sudden drop in the wall&#8217;s velocity, but direct observation of the precessional modes is lacking. Here we show experimentally, using a combination of quasi-static and real-time measurement techniques, that DWs propagate along permalloy nanowires with a periodic variation in the chirality of the walls. The frequency of this oscillation is consistent with a precession of the propagating DW, increasing linearly with field according to the Larmor precession frequency. Current in the nanowire, large enough to significantly influence the DW velocity, has little effect on the precession frequency but can be used to adjust the phase of the wall&#8217;s precession. The highly coherent and reproducible motion of the DW revealed by our studies demonstrates that the DW is a well-defined macroscopic object whose phase is inextricably interlinked to the distance travelled by the DW.</p>",,"[{'address': 'IBM Research Division, Almaden Research Center, San Jose, California 95120, USA', 'authors': ['Masamitsu Hayashi', ',\xa0Luc Thomas', ',\xa0Charles Rettner', ',\xa0Rai Moriya', '\xa0&\xa0Stuart S.

letter,Local fluctuations in the ageing of a simple structural glass,"<p>The presence of dynamical heterogeneities&#8212;that is, nanometre-scale regions of molecules rearranging cooperatively at very different rates compared with the bulk&#8212;is increasingly being recognized as crucial to our understanding of the glass transition, from the non-exponential relaxation to the divergence of the relaxation times. Although recent experiments and simulations have observed their presence directly, a clear physical picture of their origin is still lacking. Here, we present the first detailed characterization of the statistics of local fluctuations in a simulation of the ageing of a continuous-space, quasi-realistic structural glass model. A possible physical mechanism for the origin of dynamical heterogeneities in the non-equilibrium dynamics of glassy systems predicts universal scaling of the probability distributions of two-time local fluctuations. We find that to a first approximation this scaling is indeed satisfied by our results. We propose to test our results using confocal microscopy and atomic force microscopy&#160;experiments.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio 45701, USA', 'authors': ['Horacio E.

article,Phase separation and suppression of critical dynamics at quantum phase transitions of MnSi and (Sr1−xCax)RuO3,"<p>Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at zero temperature are generally studied by means of pressure or composition tuning. Volume-integrated probes such as neutron and magnetization measurements, as well as pressure uncertainties in NMR studies using powder specimens, however, have limited the characterization of magnetism and detection of discontinuous changes at QPTs. Overcoming these limitations, we carried out muon spin relaxation measurements that have a unique sensitivity to volume fractions of magnetically ordered and paramagnetic regions, and studied QPTs from itinerant helimagnet or ferromagnet to paramagnet transitions in MnSi (single crystal; varying pressure) and (Sr<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>Ca<sub>x</sub>)RuO<sub>3</sub> (ceramic specimens; varying x). Our results provide the first clear evidence that both cases are associated with phase separation and suppression of dynamic critical behaviour, reveal slow dynamics of the &#8216;partial order&#8217; diffuse spin correlations in MnSi above the critical pressure and suggest the possibility that a majority of QPTs in correlated electron systems involve first-order transitions and/or phase separation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027, USA', 'authors': ['Y.

article,Quasiparticle dynamics in graphene,"<p>The effectively massless, relativistic behaviour of graphene&#8217;s charge carriers&#8212;known as Dirac fermions&#8212;is a result of its unique electronic structure, characterized by conical valence and conduction bands that meet at a single point in momentum space (at the Dirac crossing energy). The study of many-body interactions amongst the charge carriers in graphene and related systems such as carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and graphite is of interest owing to their contribution to superconductivity and other exotic ground states in these systems. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that electron&#8211;plasmon coupling plays an unusually strong role in renormalizing the bands around the Dirac crossing energy&#8212;analogous to mass renormalization by electron&#8211;boson coupling in ordinary metals.

article,Controllable valley splitting in silicon quantum devices,"<p>Silicon has many attractive properties for quantum computing, and the quantum-dot architecture is appealing because of its controllability and scalability. However, the multiple valleys in the silicon conduction band are potentially a serious source of decoherence for spin-based quantum-dot qubits. Only when a large energy splits these valleys do we obtain well-defined and long-lived spin states appropriate for quantum computing. Here, we show that the small valley splittings observed in previous experiments on Si&#8211;SiGe heterostructures result from atomic steps at the quantum-well interface. Lateral confinement in a quantum point contact limits the electron wavefunctions to several steps, and enhances the valley splitting substantially, up to 1.5&#8201;meV. The combination of electrostatic and magnetic confinement produces a valley splitting larger than the spin splitting, which is controllable over a wide range. These results improve the outlook for realizing spin qubits with long coherence times in silicon-based devices.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA', 'authors': ['Srijit Goswami', ',\xa0K.

article,Dispersive superfluid-like shock waves in nonlinear optics,"<p>In most classical fluids, shock waves are strongly dissipative, their energy being quickly lost through viscous damping. But in systems such as cold plasmas, superfluids and Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates, where viscosity is negligible or non-existent, a fundamentally different type of shock wave can emerge whose behaviour is dominated by dispersion rather than dissipation. Dispersive shock waves are difficult to study experimentally, and analytical solutions to the equations that govern them have only been found in one dimension (1D). By exploiting a well-known, but little appreciated, correspondence between the behaviour of superfluids and nonlinear optical materials, we demonstrate an all-optical experimental platform for studying the dynamics of dispersive shock waves. This enables us to observe the propagation and nonlinear response of dispersive shock waves, including the interaction of colliding shock waves, in 1D and 2D.

With the use of carrier-envelope phase (CEP) stabilization and few-cycle laser systems it is possible to probe physical processes on unprecedented timescales. Here, we report the first experimental observation of high-harmonic emission at individual half-cycles of a laser pulse. We show that these half-cycle emissions are extremely sensitive to the CEP, providing a route to a new single-shot measurement technique of the CEP. We use this technique to measure the CEP of an 8.5&#8201;fs pulse at a centre wavelength of 800&#8201;nm with an accuracy of 20&#8201;as (1&#8201;as=1&#215;10<sup>&#8722;18</sup>&#8201;s).

article,Classes of complex networks defined by role-to-role connectivity profiles,"<p>In physical, biological, technological and social systems, interactions between units give rise to intricate networks.

A caveat of this approach is that the relevance of global properties hinges on the premise that networks are homogeneous, whereas most real-world networks have a markedly modular structure. Here, we report that networks with different functions, including the Internet, metabolic, air transportation and protein interaction networks, have distinct patterns of connections among nodes with different roles, and that, as a consequence, complex networks can be classified into two distinct functional classes on the basis of their link type frequency.
