letter,Neutrinos from gamma-ray bursts as a tool to explore quantum-gravity-induced Lorentz violation,"<p>Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) arises in various quantum-gravity theories, but typically at Planck energies that are not accessible on Earth. To test LIV, we must turn to astronomical observations. Time-of-flight measurements from astronomical sources have set the present limits on the LIV energy scale. According to existing models, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are accompanied by very high-energy neutrinos. At these energies, the background level in neutrino detectors such as IceCube (currently under construction in Antarctica) is extremely low. We show that the detection of even a single neutrino from the same direction as a GRB, months after the burst, would be statistically significant and imply that the neutrino was associated with the burst. The detection of several delayed neutrinos from different bursts with compatible relations between their delay times, energies and distances would enable us to generically determine (or set limits on) LIV at levels that cannot be reached by any other method.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Racah Institute for Physics, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 91904, Israel', 'authors': ['Uri Jacob', '\xa0&\xa0Tsvi Piran']}]",True,"['Uri Jacob', 'Tsvi Piran']","Jacob, U., Piran, T.

letter,Gapped itinerant spin excitations account for missing entropy in the hidden-order state of URu2Si2,"<p>Many correlated electron materials, such as high-temperature superconductors, geometrically frustrated oxides and low-dimensional magnets, are still objects of fruitful study because of the unique properties that arise owing to poorly understood many-body effects. Heavy-fermion metals&#8212;materials that have high effective electron masses due to those effects&#8212;represent a class of materials with exotic properties, ranging from unusual magnetism, unconventional superconductivity and &#8216;hidden&#8217; order parameters. The heavy-fermion superconductor URu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> has held the attention of physicists for the past two decades owing to the presence of a &#8216;hidden-order&#8217; phase below 17.5&#8201;K. Neutron scattering measurements indicate that the ordered moment is 0.03&#956;<sub>B</sub>, much too small to account for the large heat-capacity anomaly at 17.5&#8201;K. We present recent neutron scattering experiments that unveil a new piece of this puzzle&#8212;the spin-excitation spectrum above 17.5&#8201;K exhibits well-correlated, itinerant-like spin excitations up to at least 10&#8201;meV, emanating from incommensurate wavevectors. The large entropy change associated with the presence of an energy gap in the excitations explains the reduction in the electronic specific heat through the&#160;transition.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306-3016, USA', 'authors': ['C.

letter,Observation of Faraday rotation from a single confined spin,"<p>The ability to read out the state of a single confined spin lies at the heart of solid-state quantum-information processing. Although spin measurements using Faraday rotation of light polarization have been implemented in semiconductor spin ensembles, single-spin read-out has only been achieved using transport measurements. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical dispersive measurement of the time-averaged spin state of a single electron in a quantum dot. We obtain information on the spin state through conditional Faraday rotation of a spectrally detuned laser, induced by the polarization- and spin-selective trion (charged quantum dot) transitions. To assess the sensitivity of the technique, we use an independent resonant laser for spin-state preparation. We infer that there are &#8764;10 spin-flip Raman scattering events (that is, back-action) within our measurement timescale. Straightforward improvements such as incorporating solid-immersion lenses and higher efficiency detectors should allow for back-action-evading spin measurements, without the need for a cavity.</p>",,"[{'address': '', 'authors': ['Mete Atatüre']}, {'address': '', 'authors': ['Atac Imamoglu']}]",True,"['Mete Atatüre', '\xa0Jan Dreiser', 'Antonio Badolato', 'Atac Imamoglu']","Atatüre, M., Dreiser,  ., Badolato, A. et al.

letter,Superradiance of quantum dots,"<p>In 1954, Dicke pointed out that the description of a spontaneously radiating gas has to include the fact that all atoms or molecules interact with a common radiation field. Consequently, the individual particles may not be considered as independent sources of radiation. In this regard, the question arises of whether quantum dot (QD) systems may also exhibit signatures of cooperative radiation and hence have to be considered as coupled quantum systems. Here, we present experimental evidence for a long-range electromagnetic interaction between laterally arranged QDs. The experimental results suggest that the QDs do not behave like independent objects as long as they form an ensemble of QDs. By removing QDs from the sample, we found that the coupling was reduced. The range of interaction is shown to be at least 150&#8201;nm. This may therefore provide a mechanism to couple discrete quantum objects on a large scale.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physikalisches Institut, Technische Physik, Universität Würzburg, Am Hubland, 97074 Würzburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Michael Scheibner', ',\xa0Thomas Schmidt', ',\xa0Lukas Worschech', '\xa0&\xa0Alfred Forchel']}, {'address': 'Werkstoffe der Elektrotechnik, Universität Duisburg-Essen, Bismarckstrasse 81, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany', 'authors': ['Gerd Bacher']}, {'address': 'Institut für Festkörperphysik, Universität Bremen, Otto-Hahn-Allee, D-28359 Bremen, Germany', 'authors': ['Thorsten Passow', '\xa0&\xa0Detlef Hommel']}]",True,"['Michael Scheibner', 'Thomas Schmidt', 'Lukas Worschech', 'Alfred Forchel', 'Gerd Bacher', 'Thorsten Passow', 'Detlef Hommel']","Scheibner, M., Schmidt, T., Worschech, L. et al.

letter,Ageing memory and glassiness of a driven vortex system,"<p>Many systems in nature&#8212;glasses, interfaces and&#160;fractures being some examples&#8212;cannot equilibrate with their environment, which gives rise to novel and surprising behaviour such as memory effects, ageing and nonlinear dynamics. Unlike their equilibrated counterparts, the dynamics of out-of-equilibrium systems is generally too complex to be captured by simple macroscopic laws. Here we investigate a system that straddles the boundary between glass and crystal: a Bragg glass, formed by vortices in a superconductor. We find that the response to an applied force evolves according to a stretched exponential, with the exponent reflecting the deviation from equilibrium. After the force is removed, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scales linearly with its &#8216;age&#8217; (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slower than younger ones. We show that simple ageing can occur naturally in the presence of sufficient quenched disorder. Moreover, the hierarchical distribution of timescales, arising when chunks of loose vortices cannot move before trapped ones become dislodged, leads to a stretched-exponential response.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08855, USA', 'authors': ['Xu Du', ',\xa0Guohong Li', '\xa0&\xa0Eva Y.

letter,A molecular synchrotron,"<p>Many of the tools for manipulating the motion of neutral atoms and molecules take their inspiration from techniques developed for charged particles. Traps for atoms&#8212;akin to the Paul trap for ions&#8212;have paved the way for many exciting experiments, ranging from ultra-precise clocks to creating quantum degenerate matter. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to developing a neutral particle analogue of a synchrotron&#8212;arguably, the most celebrated tool of the charged-particle physicist. So far, the few experiments dealing with ring structures for neutral particles have used cylindrically symmetric designs; in these rings, no force is applied to the particles along the longitudinal direction and the stored particles are free to fill the entire ring. Here, we demonstrate a synchrotron for neutral polar molecules. A packet of ammonia molecules is accelerated, decelerated and focused along the longitudinal direction (&#8216;bunched&#8217;) using the fringe fields between the two halves of a segmented hexapole ring. The stored bunch of cold molecules (T=0.5&#8201;mK) is confined to a 3&#8201;mm packet even after a flight distance of over 30&#8201;m (40 round trips).

article,Quantum non-demolition measurement of a superconducting two-level system,"<p>In quantum mechanics, the process of measurement is a subtle interplay between extraction of information and disturbance of the state of the quantum system. A quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement minimizes this disturbance by using a particular system&#8212;detector interaction that preserves the eigenstates of a suitable operator of the quantum system. This leads to an ideal projective measurement. We present experiments in which we carry out two consecutive measurements on a quantum two-level system, a superconducting flux qubit, by probing the hysteretic behaviour of a coupled nonlinear resonator. The large correlation between the results of the two measurements demonstrates the QND nature of the readout method. The fact that a QND measurement is possible for superconducting qubits strengthens the notion that these fabricated mesoscopic systems are to be regarded as fundamental quantum objects. Our results are also relevant for quantum-information processing for protocols such as state preparation and error correction.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Quantum Transport Group, Kavli Institute of NanoScience, Delft University of Technology, Lorentzweg 1, 2628 CJ Delft, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['A.

article,Interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy,"<p>State-of-the-art methods in high-resolution three-dimensional optical microscopy require that the focus be scanned through the entire region of interest. However, an analysis of the physics of the light&#8211;sample interaction reveals that the Fourier-space coverage is independent of depth. Here we show that, by solving the inverse scattering problem for interference microscopy, computed reconstruction yields volumes with a resolution in all planes that is equivalent to the resolution achieved only at the focal plane for conventional high-resolution microscopy. In short, the entire illuminated volume has spatially invariant resolution, thus eliminating the compromise between resolution and depth of field. We describe and demonstrate a novel computational image-formation technique called interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM).
