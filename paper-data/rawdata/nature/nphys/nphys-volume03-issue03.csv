review article,Challenges for semiconductor spintronics,"<p>High-volume information-processing and communications devices are at present based on semiconductor devices, whereas information-storage devices rely on multilayers of magnetic metals and insulators. Switching within information-processing devices is performed by the controlled motion of small pools of charge, whereas in the magnetic storage devices information storage and retrieval is performed by reorienting magnetic domains (although charge motion is often used for the final stage of readout). Semiconductor spintronics offers a possible direction towards the development of hybrid devices that could perform all three of these operations, logic, communications and storage, within the same materials technology. By taking advantage of spin coherence it also may sidestep some limitations on information manipulation previously thought to be fundamental. This article focuses on advances towards these goals in the past decade, during which experimental progress has been extraordinary.</p>",[],False,"[""David D. Awschalom"", ""Michael E.

letter,Two new vortex liquids,"<p>In 1967, Reatto and Chester proposed that solid helium-4 might exhibit superfluidity, and in 1970, Leggett suggested what was thought to be a definitive experimental test: to find non-classical rotational inertia in a toroidal sample. More than three decades later, the observation by Kim and Chan of exactly that effect generated great interest and has been repeated and confirmed by a number of groups. However, many attempts to find actual superflow in truly solid samples have failed. Here, I draw an analogy with a second example of anomalous response to vorticity in a dissipative fluid, the vortex liquid phase in the pseudogap region of high-temperature superconductors, and propose that the solid helium experiments have been mischaracterized: what is observed is not supersolidity but an incompressible vortex liquid. This state is distinct from a conventional liquid in that its properties are dominated by conserved supercurrents flowing around a thermally fluctuating tangle of vortices.</p>",[],True,"[""Philip W.

letter,Two energy scales in the spin excitations of the high-temperature superconductor La2−xSrxCuO4,"<p>The excitations responsible for producing high-temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides have yet to be identified. Two promising candidates are collective spin excitations and phonons. A recent argument against spin excitations is based on their inability to explain structures observed in electronic spectroscopies such as photoemission and optical conductivity. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to demonstrate that collective spin excitations in optimally doped La<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> are more structured than previously thought. The excitations have a two-component structure with a low-frequency component strongest around 18&#8201;meV and a broader component peaking near 40&#8211;70&#8201;meV. The second component carries most of the spectral weight and its energy matches structures observed in photoemission in the range 50&#8211;90&#8201;meV. Our results demonstrate that collective spin excitations can explain features of electronic spectroscopies and are therefore likely to be strongly coupled to the electron quasiparticles.</p>",[],True,"[""B.

letter,Kinks in the dispersion of strongly correlated electrons,"<p>The properties of condensed matter are determined by single-particle and collective excitations and their mutual interactions. These quantum-mechanical excitations are characterized by an energy, E, and a momentum, &#8463;k, which are related through their dispersion, E<sub>k</sub>. The coupling of excitations may lead to abrupt changes (kinks) in the slope of the dispersion. Kinks thus carry important information about the internal degrees of freedom of a many-body system and their effective interaction. Here, we report a novel, purely electronic mechanism leading to kinks, which is not related to any coupling of excitations. Namely, kinks are predicted for any strongly correlated metal whose spectral function shows a three-peak structure with well-separated Hubbard subbands and a central peak, as observed, for example, in transition-metal oxides. These kinks can appear at energies as high as a few hundred millielectron volts, as found in recent spectroscopy experiments on high-temperature superconductors and other transition-metal oxides. Our theory determines not only the position of the kinks but also the range of validity of Fermi-liquid theory.</p>",[],True,"[""K. Byczuk"", ""M. Kollar"", ""K. Held"", ""Y.-F. Yang"", ""I. A.

letter,Valley filter and valley valve in graphene,"<p>The potential of graphene for carbon electronics rests on the possibilities offered by its unusual band structure to create devices that have no analogue in silicon-based electronics. Conduction and valence bands in graphene form conically shaped valleys, touching at a point called the Dirac point. There are two inequivalent Dirac points in the Brillouin zone, related by time-reversal symmetry. Intervalley scattering is suppressed in pure samples. The independence and degeneracy of the valley degree of freedom suggests that it might be used to control an electronic device, in much the same way as the electron spin is used in spintronics or quantum computing. A key ingredient for &#8216;valleytronics&#8217; would be a controllable way of occupying a single valley in graphene, thereby producing a valley polarization. Here we propose such a valley filter, based on a ballistic point contact with zigzag edges. The polarity can be inverted by local application of a gate voltage to the point contact region. Two valley filters in series may function as an electrostatically controlled valley valve, representing a zero-magnetic-field counterpart to the familiar spin valve.</p>",[],True,"[""A.

letter,Spatially resolved soft X-ray spectrometry from single-image diffraction,"<p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) offers better coherence, shorter pulse durations and far greater accessibility than synchrotron sources. These factors make HHG an increasingly important source of soft X-rays and an excellent resource in many emerging areas, for example, the time-resolved study of conformational changes in single biological molecules. Here, we demonstrate a novel technique that enables us to reconstruct spectral information spatially across an X-ray beam. As only a single diffraction image is required per measurement, this technique is well suited to time-resolved studies. This technique is applicable to many types of X-ray source and can be adapted for different spectral regions. Here, results are obtained using a capillary high-harmonic source, revealing detailed information that brings new insight into the physical processes occurring inside the source and enabling us to show the first measurement of radial variation of harmonic order in the emission from an HHG capillary.</p>",[],True,"[""M.

letter,Making a splash with water repellency,"<p>A splash is usually heard when a solid body enters water at large velocity. This phenomenon originates from the formation of an air cavity during the impact. The classical view of impacts on free surfaces relies solely on fluid inertia; therefore, surface properties and viscous effects should be negligible at sufficiently large velocities. In strong contrast to this large-scale hydrodynamic viewpoint, we demonstrate here that the wettability of the impacting body is a key factor in determining the degree of splashing. This unforeseen fact is further embodied in the dependence of the threshold velocity for air entrainment on the contact angle of the impacting body, as well as on the ratio between surface tension and fluid viscosity, thereby defining a critical capillary velocity. As a paradigm, superhydrophobic impactors make a big splash for any impact velocity.</p>",[],True,"[""Cyril Duez"", ""Christophe Ybert"", ""Christophe Clanet"", ""Lyd\u00e9ric Bocquet""]","Duez, C., Ybert, C., Clanet, C. et al.

article,Fluctuating Cu–O–Cu bond model of high-temperature superconductivity,"<p>Twenty years of research have yet to produce a consensus on the origin of high-temperature superconductivity (HTS). However, several generic characteristics of the copper oxide superconductors have emerged as the essential ingredients of and/or constraints on any viable microscopic model of HTS. Besides a critical temperature T<sub>c</sub> of the order of 100&#8201;K, they include a d-wave superconducting gap with Fermi liquid nodal excitations, a pseudogap with d-symmetry and the characteristic temperature scale T<sup>*</sup>, an anomalous doping-dependent oxygen isotope shift, nanometre-scale gap inhomogeneity and so on. The isotope shift implies a key role for oxygen vibrations, but conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer single-phonon coupling is essentially forbidden by symmetry and by the on-site Coulomb interaction U. Here we invoke the nonlinear modulation of the Cu&#8211;Cu bond by planar oxygen vibrations. The Fermi liquid nature of the d-wave superconducting ground state supports a weak-coupling treatment of this modulation. The dominant fluctuations are manifested in a pattern of oxygen vibrational square amplitudes with quadrupolar symmetry around a given Cu site. On the basis of such bond fluctuations, both dynamic and static, we can understand the salient features of HTS.</p>",[],False,"[""D. M. Newns"", ""C. C. Tsuei""]","Newns, D., Tsuei, C.

article,Spin qubits in graphene quantum dots,"<p>The main characteristics of good qubits are long coherence times in combination with fast operating times. It is well known that carbon-based materials could increase the coherence times of spin qubits, which are among the most developed solid-state qubits. Here, we propose how to form spin qubits in graphene quantum dots. A crucial requirement to achieve this goal is to find quantum-dot states where the usual valley degeneracy in bulk graphene is lifted. We show that this problem can be avoided in quantum dots based on ribbons of graphene with armchair boundaries. The most remarkable new feature of the proposed spin qubits is that, in an array of many qubits, it is possible to couple any two of them via Heisenberg exchange with the others being decoupled by detuning. This unique feature is a direct consequence of the quasi-relativistic spectrum of graphene.</p>",[],False,"[""Bj\u00f6rn Trauzettel"", ""Denis V.

article,Electrical detection of spin transport in lateral ferromagnet–semiconductor devices,"<p>The development of semiconductor spintronics requires a reliable electronic means for writing, processing and reading information using spin-polarized carriers. Here, we demonstrate a fully electrical scheme for achieving spin injection, transport and detection in a single device. Our device consists of a lateral semiconducting channel with two ferromagnetic contacts, one of which serves as a source of spin-polarized electrons and the other as a detector. Spin detection in the device is achieved through a non-local, spin-sensitive, Schottky-tunnel-barrier contact whose electrochemical potential depends on the relative magnetizations of the source and detector. We verify the effectiveness of this approach by showing that a transverse magnetic field suppresses the non-local signal at the detection contact by inducing spin precession and dephasing in the channel (the Hanle effect). The sign of the signal varies with the injection current and is correlated with the spin polarization in the channel as determined by optical Kerr rotation measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaohua Lou"", ""Christoph Adelmann"", ""Scott A.

article,Probing rare physical trajectories with Lyapunov weighted dynamics,"<p>In nonlinear dynamical systems, atypical trajectories often play an important role. For instance, resonances and separatrices determine the fate of planetary systems, and localized objects such as solitons and breathers provide mechanisms of energy transport in systems such as Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates and biological molecules. Unfortunately, most of the numerical methods to locate these &#8216;rare&#8217; trajectories are confined to low-dimensional or toy models, whereas the realms of statistical physics, chemical reactions or astronomy are still hard to reach. Here we implement an efficient method that enables us to work in higher dimensions by selecting trajectories with unusual chaoticity. As an example, we study the Fermi&#8211;Pasta&#8211;Ulam nonlinear chain in equilibrium and show that the algorithm rapidly singles out the soliton solutions when searching for trajectories with low levels of chaoticity, and chaotic breathers in the opposite situation. We expect the scheme to have natural applications in celestial mechanics and turbulence, where it can readily be combined with existing numerical methods.</p>",[],False,"[""Julien Tailleur"", ""Jorge Kurchan""]","Tailleur, J., Kurchan, J.
