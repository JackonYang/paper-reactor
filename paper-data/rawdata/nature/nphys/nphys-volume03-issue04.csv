letter,In situ evidence of magnetic reconnection in turbulent plasma,"<p>Magnetic reconnection is a universal process leading to energy conversion in plasmas. It occurs in the Solar System, in laboratory plasmas  and is important in astrophysics . Reconnection has been observed so far only at large-scale boundaries between different plasma environments . It is not known whether reconnection occurs and is important in turbulent plasmas where many small-scale boundaries can form. Solar and laboratory measurements as well as numerical simulations  indicate such possibility. Here we report, for the first time, in situ evidence of reconnection in a turbulent plasma. The turbulent environment is the solar wind downstream of the Earth&#8217;s bow shock. We show that reconnection is fast and electromagnetic energy is converted into heating and acceleration of particles. This has significant implications for laboratory and astrophysical plasmas where both turbulence and reconnection should be common.</p>",[],True,"[""A. Retin\u00f2"", ""D. Sundkvist"", ""A.

letter,Two-dimensional vortices in superconductors,"<p>Superconductors have two key characteristics: they expel magnetic field and they conduct electrical current with zero resistance. However, both properties are compromised in high magnetic fields, which can penetrate the material and create a mixed state of quantized vortices. The vortices move in response to an electrical current, dissipating energy and destroying the zero-resistance state. One of the central problems for applications of high-temperature superconductivity is the stabilization of vortices to ensure zero electrical resistance. We find that vortices in the anisotropic superconductor Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+&#948;</sub> (Bi-2212) have a phase transition from a liquid state, which is inherently unstable, to a two-dimensional vortex solid. We show that at high field the transition temperature is independent of magnetic field, as was predicted theoretically for the melting of an ideal two-dimensional vortex lattice. Our results indicate that the stable solid phase can be reached at any field, as may be necessary for applications involving superconducting magnets. The vortex solid is disordered, as suggested by previous studies at lower fields. But its evolution with increasing magnetic field exhibits unexpected threshold behaviour that needs further investigation.</p>",[],True,"[""Bo Chen"", ""W. P.

letter,Conditional statistics of electron transport in interacting nanoscale conductors,"<p>There is an intimate connection between the acquisition of information and how this information changes the remaining uncertainty in the system. This trade-off between information and uncertainty plays a central role in the context of detection. Recent advances in the ability to make accurate, on-chip measurements of individual-electron current through a quantum dot (QD) have been enabled by exploiting the sensitivity of a second current, passing through a nearby quantum point contact (QPC), to the fluctuating charge on the QD. An important characteristic of QPC detectors is their minimal influence on the systems they probe. Here we show that even the operation of an effectively non-invasive QPC detector can statistically alter the system&#8217;s behaviour. By observing a particular QPC current, the statistical distribution of the QD conditional current undergoes a substantial change in comparison to that expected for unconditional shot noise. These results are in almost perfect agreement with a theoretical model we develop to predict the joint current probability distribution and conditional transport statistics of interacting nanoscale&#160;systems.</p>",[],True,"[""Eugene V.

letter,A local metallic state in globally insulating La1.24Sr1.76Mn2O7 well above the metal–insulator transition,"<p>The distinction between metals, semiconductors and insulators depends on the behaviour of the electrons nearest the Fermi level E<sub>F</sub>, which separates the occupied from the unoccupied electron energy levels. For a metal, E<sub>F</sub> lies in the middle of a band of electronic states, whereas E<sub>F</sub> in insulators and semiconductors lies in the gap between states. The temperature-induced transition from a metallic to an insulating state in a solid is generally connected to a vanishing of the low-energy electronic excitations. Here we show the first direct evidence of a counter-example, in which a significant electronic density of states at the Fermi energy exists in the insulating regime. In particular, angle-resolved photoemission data from the colossal magnetoresistive oxide La<sub>1.24</sub>Sr<sub>1.76</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> show clear Fermi-edge steps, both below the metal&#8211;insulator transition temperature T<sub>C</sub>, when the sample is globally metallic, and above T<sub>C</sub>, when it is globally insulating. Further, small amounts of metallic spectral weight survive up to temperatures more than twice T<sub>C</sub>.

letter,A single-photon server with just one atom,"<p>Neutral atoms are ideal objects for the deterministic processing of quantum information. Entanglement operations have been carried out by photon exchange or controlled collisions, and atom&#8211;photon interfaces have been realized with single atoms in free space or strongly coupled to an optical cavity. A long-standing challenge with neutral atoms, however, is to overcome the limited observation time. Without exception, quantum effects appeared only after ensemble averaging. Here, we report on a single-photon source with one, and only one, atom quasi-permanently coupled to a high-finesse cavity. &#8216;Quasi-permanent&#8217; refers to our ability to keep the atom long enough to, first, quantify the photon-emission statistics and, second, guarantee the subsequent performance as a single-photon server delivering up to 300,000 photons for up to 30&#8201;s.

letter,Entanglement percolation in quantum networks,"<p>Quantum networks are composed of nodes that can send and receive quantum states by exchanging photons. Their goal is to facilitate quantum communication between any nodes, something that can be used to send secret messages in a secure way, and to communicate more efficiently than in classical networks. These goals can be achieved, for instance, via teleportation. Here we show that the design of efficient quantum-communication protocols in quantum networks involves intriguing quantum phenomena, depending both on the way the nodes are connected and on the entanglement between them. These phenomena can be used to design protocols that overcome the exponential decrease of signals with the number of nodes. We relate the problem of establishing maximally entangled states between nodes to classical percolation in statistical mechanics, and demonstrate that phase transitions can be used to optimize the operation of quantum networks.</p>",[],True,"[""Antonio Ac\u00edn"", ""J.

letter,Measurement of growing dynamical length scales and prediction of the jamming transition in a granular material,"<p>Supercooled liquids and dense colloidal suspensions exhibit anomalous behaviour known as &#8216;spatially heterogeneous dynamics&#8217; (SHD), which becomes increasingly pronounced as the system approaches the glass transition. Recently, the observation of SHD in confined granular packings under slow shear near the onset of jamming has bolstered speculation that the two transitions are related. Here, we report measurements of SHD in a system of air-driven granular beads, as a function of both density and effective temperature. On approach to jamming, the dynamics becomes progressively slower and more spatially heterogeneous. The rapid growth of timescales and dynamical length scales characterizing the heterogeneities can be described both by mode-coupling theory and the Vogel&#8211;Tammann&#8211;Fulcher (VTF) equation, such as in glass-forming liquids. The value of the control variable at the VTF transition coincides with point J (refs&#160;), the random close-packed jamming density at which all motion ceases, in analogy to a zero-temperature ideal glass transition. Our findings demonstrate further universality of the jamming concept and provide a significant step forward in the quest for a unified theory of jamming in disparate systems.</p>",[],True,"[""Aaron S.

article,Effects of disorder on electron spin dynamics in a semiconductor quantum well,"<p>Using the spin of the electron to carry information, instead of or in addition to its charge, could provide advances in the capabilities of microelectronics. Successful implementation of spin-based electronics requires preservation of the electron spin coherence. In n-doped semiconductors, long spin-coherence times have been observed, with a maximum at a &#8216;magic&#8217; electron density. Here, we vary the density in a two-dimensional electron gas, and show that spin coherence is lost because of the interplay between localization by disorder and dynamical scattering. By measuring the electron Land&#233; g-factor dependence on density, we determine the density of states (DOS), which characterizes the disorder potential. Using our knowledge of the DOS, a simple model estimates the temperature and excitation intensity dependence of the g factor, qualitatively agreeing with experiments. This agreement confirms the importance of disorder and provides predictive power for designing spin-based electronic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Zhigang Chen"", ""Sam G.

article,Quasi-phase-matching and quantum-path control of high-harmonic generation using counterpropagating light,"<p>High-order harmonic upconversion of femtosecond lasers produces a unique source of short-wavelength light with femtosecond-to-attosecond pulse duration. However, because the involved nonlinear medium is a partially ionized gas, traditional approaches for phase-matching the conversion process are not applicable. This severely limits the flux from this source. Here, we demonstrate the first use of a train of counterpropagating light pulses to enhance high-harmonic emission. This all-optical quasi-phase-matching technique uses interfering beams to scramble the quantum phase of the generated short-wavelength light, to suppress emission from out-of-phase regions. Selective enhancement of more than 300 is observed at photon energies around 70&#8201;eV in argon gas. Finally, we show that by adjusting the intensity of the counterpropagating light, different electron quantum trajectories can be selectively enhanced, demonstrating attosecond-timescale coherent control of the radiating electron wavefunction.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaoshi Zhang"", ""Amy L.
