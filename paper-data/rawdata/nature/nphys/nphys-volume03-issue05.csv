review article,Twisted photons,"<p>The orbital angular momentum of light represents a fundamentally new optical degree of freedom. Unlike linear momentum, or spin angular momentum, which is associated with the polarization of light, orbital angular momentum arises as a subtler and more complex consequence of the spatial distribution of the intensity and phase of an optical field &#8212; even down to the single photon limit. Consequently, researchers have only begun to appreciate its implications for our understanding of the many ways in which light and matter can interact, or its practical potential for quantum information applications. This article reviews some of the landmark advances in the study and use of the orbital angular momentum of photons, and in particular its potential for realizing high-dimensional quantum spaces.</p>",[],False,"[""Gabriel Molina-Terriza"", ""Juan P.

letter,Low-temperature vortex liquid in La2−xSrxCuO4,"<p>In copper oxide superconductors, the lightly doped (small dopant concentration, x) region is of major interest because superconductivity, antiferromagnetism and the pseudogap state come together near a critical doping value, x<sub>c</sub>. But the way in which superconductivity is destroyed as x is decreased at very low temperatures, T, is not clear. Does the pair condensate vanish abruptly at a critical value, x<sub>c</sub>? Or is phase coherence of the condensate destroyed by spontaneous vortices&#8212;as is the case at elevated T (refs&#160;)? So far, magnetization data at low T are very sparse in this region of the phase diagram. Here, we report torque magnetometry measurements on La<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, which show that, in zero magnetic field, quantum phase fluctuations destroy superconductivity at x<sub>c</sub>&#8776;0.055. The phase-disordered condensate survives to x=0.03. In finite field H, the vortex solid-to-liquid transition occurs at H lower than the depairing field, H<sub>c2</sub>.

letter,The possibility of an intrinsic spin lattice in high-mobility semiconductor heterostructures,"<p>Embedding magnetic moments into semiconductor heterostructures offers a tuneable access to various forms of magnetic ordering and phase transitions in low-dimensional electron systems. In general, the moments are introduced artificially, by either doping with ferromagnetic atoms, or electrostatically confining odd-electron quantum dots. Here, we report experimental evidence of an independent, and intrinsic, source of localized spins in high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures with large setback distance (&#8776;80&#8201;nm) in modulation doping. Measurements reveal a quasi-regular distribution of the spins in the delocalized Fermi sea, and a mutual interaction via the Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida (RKKY) indirect exchange below 100&#8201;mK.

letter,Probing quantum phases of ultracold atoms in optical lattices by transmission spectra in cavity quantum electrodynamics,"<p>Studies of ultracold gases in optical lattices provide a means for testing fundamental and application-oriented quantum many-body concepts of condensed-matter physics in well controllable atomic systems; examples include strongly correlated phases and quantum-information processing. Standard methods to observe quantum properties of Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates are based on matter&#8211;wave interference between atoms released from traps, a method that ultimately destroys the system. Here, we propose a new approach on the basis of optical measurements that conserves the number of atoms. We prove that atomic quantum statistics can be mapped on transmission spectra of high-Q cavities, where atoms create a quantum refractive index. This can be useful for studying phase transitions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, between Mott insulator and superfluid states&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as various phases show qualitatively distinct light scattering.

letter,Efficient unidirectional nanoslit couplers for surface plasmons,"<p>The emerging field of plasmonics is based on exploiting the coupling between light and collective electronic excitations within conducting materials known as surface plasmons. Because the so-called surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes that arise from this coupling are not constrained by the optical diffraction limit, it is hoped that they could enable the construction of ultracompact optical components. But in order that such potential can be realized, it is vital that the relatively poor light&#8211;SPP coupling be improved. This is made worse by the fact that the incident light that is conventionally used to launch SPPs in a metal film  is a significant source of noise, unless directed away from a region of interest, which then decreases the signal and increases the system&#8217;s size. Back-side illumination of subwavelength apertures in optically thick metal films eliminates this problem but does not ensure a unique propagation direction for the SPP. We propose a novel back-side slit-illumination method that incorporates a periodic array of grooves carved into the front side of a thick metal film. Bragg reflection enhances the propagation of SPPs away from the array, enabling them to be unidirectionally launched from, and focused to, a localized point.</p>",[],True,"[""F.

letter,Bloch gain in quantum cascade lasers,"<p>Esaki and Tsu&#8217;s superlattice, made by alternating two different semiconductor materials, was the first one-dimensional artificial crystal that demonstrated the ability to tailor semiconductor properties. One motivation of this work was the realization of the Bloch oscillator and the use of its particular dispersive optical gain to achieve a tuneable source of electromagnetic radiation. However, these superlattices were electrically unstable in the steady state. Fortunately, because it is based on scattering-assisted transitions, this particular gain does not arise only in superlattices, but also more generally in semiconductor heterostructures such as quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), where the electrical stability can be controlled. Here, we show the unambiguous spectral signature of Bloch gain in a special QCL designed to enhance the latter by exhibiting laser action in the condition of weak to vanishing population inversion.</p>",[],True,"[""Romain Terazzi"", ""Tobias Gresch"", ""Marcella Giovannini"", ""Nicolas Hoyler"", ""Norihiko Sekine"", ""J\u00e9r\u00f4me Faist""]","Terazzi, R., Gresch, T., Giovannini, M. et al.

letter,Nearly ferromagnetic Fermi-liquid behaviour in YFe2Zn20 and high-temperature ferromagnetism of GdFe2Zn20,"<p>One of the historic goals of alchemy was to turn base elements into precious ones. Although the practice of alchemy has been superseded by chemistry and solid-state physics, the desire to dramatically change or tune the properties of a compound, preferably through small changes in stoichiometry or composition, remains. This desire becomes even more compelling for compounds that can be tuned to extremes in behaviour. Here, we report that the RT<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>20</sub> (R=rare earth and T=transition metal) family of compounds manifests exactly this type of versatility, even though they are more than 85% Zn. By tuning T, we find that YFe<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>20</sub> is closer to ferromagnetism than elemental Pd, the classic example of a nearly ferromagnetic Fermi liquid. By submerging Gd in this highly polarizable Fermi liquid, we tune the system to a remarkably high-temperature ferromagnetic (T<sub>C</sub>=86&#8201;K) state for a compound with less than 5% Gd.

letter,A metastable limit for compressed liquid water,"<p>The transformation of liquid water to solid ice is typically a slow process. To cool a sample below the melting point requires some time, as does nucleation from the metastable liquid, so freezing usually occurs over many seconds. Freezing conditions can be created much more quickly using isentropic compression techniques, which provide insight into the limiting timescales of the phase transition. Here, we show that water rapidly freezes without a nucleator under sufficient compression, establishing a practical limit for the metastable liquid phase. Above 7&#8201;GPa, compressed water completely transforms to a high-pressure phase within a few nanoseconds. The consistent observation of freezing with different samples and container materials suggests that the transition nucleates homogeneously. The observation of complete freezing on these timescales further implies that the liquid reaches a hypercooled state.</p>",[],True,"[""D. H. Dolan"", ""M. D. Knudson"", ""C. A. Hall"", ""C.

A key and topical application is the development of a fundamental standard of electrical current linking the ampere to the elementary charge and frequency. For a practical standard, currents at the nanoampere level are required, corresponding to gigahertz transport frequencies. Recent research has concentrated on transport using Coulomb blockade techniques. However, the tunnelling time of the electrons in such devices limits the operation to a few megahertz. We present a different pumping mechanism of single charges, whereby electrons &#8216;surf&#8217; as particles on a time-dependent potential instead of tunnelling through the barriers as waves. This potential is created by two phase-shifted sinusoidal signals applied directly to metallic finger gates on an etched GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wire.

article,Mapping surface plasmons on a single metallic nanoparticle,"<p>Understanding how light interacts with matter at the nanometre scale is a fundamental issue in optoelectronics and nanophotonics. In particular, many applications (such as bio-sensing, cancer therapy and all-optical signal processing) rely on surface-bound optical excitations in metallic nanoparticles. However, so far no experimental technique has been capable of imaging localized optical excitations with sufficient resolution to reveal their dramatic spatial variation over one single nanoparticle. Here, we present a novel method applied on silver nanotriangles, achieving such resolution by recording maps of plasmons in the near-infrared/visible/ultraviolet domain using electron beams instead of photons. This method relies on the detection of plasmons as resonance peaks in the energy-loss spectra of subnanometre electron beams rastered on nanoparticles of well-defined geometrical parameters. This represents a significant improvement in the spatial resolution with which plasmonic modes can be imaged, and provides a powerful tool in the development of nanometre-level optics.</p>",[],False,"[""Jaysen Nelayah"", ""Mathieu Kociak"", ""Odile St\u00e9phan"", ""F.

Simulated networks with very short filaments and long crosslinkers resemble the cytoskeleton of the red blood cell and remain isotropic in compression and shear, seeming well-suited to blood flow.
