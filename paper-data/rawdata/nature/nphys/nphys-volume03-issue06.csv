letter,Spin–valley phase diagram of the two-dimensional metal–insulator transition,"<p>The metallic behaviour of the resistivity observed at low temperatures in low-disorder, dilute, two-dimensional (2D) carrier systems is of considerable interest as it defies the scaling theory of localization in two dimensions. Although the origin of the metallic behaviour remains unknown and controversial, there is widespread evidence that the spin degree of the freedom plays a crucial role. Here, we directly probe the role of another discrete electronic degree of freedom, namely the valley polarization. Using symmetry-breaking strain together with an in-plane magnetic field to tune the valley and spin polarizations of an AlAs 2D electron system at fixed density, we map out a spin&#8211;valley phase diagram for its metal&#8211;insulator transition. The insulating phase occurs in the quadrant where the system is sufficiently spin and valley polarized. This observation establishes the equivalent roles of spin and valley degrees of freedom in the 2D metal&#8211;insulator transition.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA', 'authors': ['O.

letter,Microscopic manifestation of the spin phase transition at filling factor 2/3,"<p>First-order phase transitions are known to be accompanied by hysteresis due to the formation of domains with different order parameters. As the transition is approached, the domain sizes increase to macroscopic dimensions. It is therefore natural to expect that hysteresis will be absent from samples of microscopic size. Here, we explore from a microscopic standpoint the hysteretic behaviour across the spin phase transition that occurs at filling &#957;=2/3 in the fractional-quantum-Hall regime. Using a single-electron transistor, we follow the evolution of localized states across the spin transition by measuring the local compressibility. Localized-state spectra clearly reveal the hysteretic behaviour accompanying the transition. Using electrostatic gating we continuously vary the size of the sample undergoing the phase transition. For submicrometre dimensions the hysteresis disappears, indicating domain sizes in excess of&#160;500&#8201;nm.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel', 'authors': ['Basile Verdene', ',\xa0Jens Martin', ',\xa0Diana Mahalu', '\xa0&\xa0Amir Yacoby']}, {'address': 'Max-Planck-Institute for Solid State Physics, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany', 'authors': ['Gerardo Gamez', ',\xa0Jurgen Smet', '\xa0&\xa0Klaus von Klitzing']}, {'address': 'Walter Schottky Institut, Technische Universität München, 85748 Garching, Germany', 'authors': ['Dieter Schuh', '\xa0&\xa0Gerhard Abstreiter']}]",True,"['Basile Verdene', 'Jens Martin', 'Gerardo Gamez', 'Jurgen Smet', 'Klaus von Klitzing', 'Diana Mahalu', 'Dieter Schuh', 'Gerhard Abstreiter', 'Amir Yacoby']","Verdene, B., Martin, J., Gamez, G. et al.

Spinels, AB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, can realize the most highly frustrated network of corner-sharing tetrahedra.

letter,Ultrafast evolution of photonic eigenstates in k-space,"<p>Periodic structures have a large influence on propagating waves. This holds for various types of waves over a large range of length scales: from electrons in atomic crystals and light in photonic crystals to acoustic waves in sonic crystals. The eigenstates of these waves are best described with a band structure, which represents the relation between the energy and the wavevector (k). This relation is usually not straightforward: owing to the imposed periodicity, bands are folded into every Brillouin zone, inducing splitting of bands and the appearance of bandgaps. As a result, exciting phenomena such as negative refraction, auto-collimation of waves and low group velocities arise. k-space investigations of electronic eigenstates have already yielded new insights into the behaviour of electrons at surfaces and in novel materials. However, for a complete characterization of a structure, an understanding of the mutual coupling of eigenstates is also essential. Here, we investigate the propagation of light pulses through a photonic crystal structure using a near-field microscope. Tracking the evolution of the photonic eigenstates in both k-space and time allows us to identify individual eigenstates and to uncover their dynamics and coupling to other eigenstates on femtosecond timescales even when co-localized in real space and time.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Nanophotonics, FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF), Kruislaan 407, 1098 SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands', 'authors': ['Rob J.

letter,Breaking the delay-bandwidth limit in a photonic structure,"<p>Storing light on-chip, which requires that the speed of light be significantly slowed down, is crucial for enabling photonic circuits on-chip. Ultraslow propagation and even stopping of light have been demonstrated using the electromagnetically induced transparency effect in atomic systems and the coherent population oscillation effect in solid-state systems. The wavelengths and bandwidths of light in such devices are tightly constrained by the property of the material absorption lines, which limits their application in information technologies. Various slow-light devices based on photonic structures have also been demonstrated; however, these devices suffer a fundamental trade-off between the transmission bandwidth and the optical delay. It has been shown theoretically that stopping light on-chip and thereby breaking the fundamental link between the delay and the bandwidth can be achieved by ultrafast tuning of photonic structures. Using this mechanism, here we report the first demonstration of storing light using photonic structures on-chip, with storage times longer than the bandwidth-determined photon lifetime of the static device. The release time of the pulse is externally controlled.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, 411 Phillips Hall, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA', 'authors': ['Qianfan Xu', ',\xa0Po Dong', '\xa0&\xa0Michal Lipson']}]",True,"['Qianfan Xu', 'Po Dong', 'Michal Lipson']","Xu, Q., Dong, P. & Lipson, M.

letter,Achievement of robust high-efficiency 1 MW oscillation in the hard-self-excitation region by a 170 GHz continuous-wave gyrotron,"<p>Gyrotrons are a high-power source of coherent microwave radiation. Their oscillation mechanism is a cyclotron-resonance maser effect, in which a fraction of the rotational kinetic energy of a mildly relativistic magnetized electron beam is converted into electromagnetic energy. The most active area of gyrotron development is their potential use for heating magnetically confined fusion plasmas to the point of thermonuclear ignition. A major obstacle to this endeavour is that during high-power millimetre-wave operation competing modes and mode shifts seriously degrade a gyrotron&#8217;s stability and efficiency. Here, we show that these problems can be overcome by active control of the electron-beam parameters during the oscillation. In doing so, we successfully demonstrate the robust steady-state operation of a 170&#8201;GHz gyrotron producing a continuous 1&#8201;MW output power with an unprecedented efficiency of over 55% in a hard-self-excitation region. Moreover, we find that an adjacent resonant mode previously expected to compete with and adversely affect the principal operating mode does not in fact jeopardize but rather helps this mode as a result of nonlinear effects. The result improves the outlook for using these devices for heating and instability control in future experimental fusion reactors, such as&#160;ITER.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Plasma Heating Technology Group, Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), 801-1 Mukoyama, Naka-shi, Ibaraki 311-0193, Japan', 'authors': ['Keishi Sakamoto', ',\xa0Atsushi Kasugai', ',\xa0Koji Takahashi', ',\xa0Ryutaro Minami', ',\xa0Noriyuki Kobayashi', '\xa0&\xa0Ken Kajiwara']}]",True,"['Keishi Sakamoto', 'Atsushi Kasugai', 'Koji Takahashi', 'Ryutaro Minami', 'Noriyuki Kobayashi', 'Ken Kajiwara']","Sakamoto, K., Kasugai, A., Takahashi, K. et al.

letter,Ultrafast two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of hyperpolarized solutions,"<p>Two-dimensional (2D) NMR is an important tool for elucidating molecular structure and dynamics. However, the method is limited by the low sensitivity inherent to NMR techniques, resulting in typical acquisition times for 2D NMR spectra ranging from minutes to hours.

Whereas this methodology is able to provide the sensitivity equivalent of &#8764;10<sup>6</sup> scans, it is constrained to extract its &#8216;super-spectrum&#8217; within a single transient, making it a poor starting point for conventional 2D NMR acquisitions.

letter,Unified force law for granular impact cratering,"<p>Experiments on the low-speed impact of solid objects into granular media have been used both to mimic geophysical events and to probe the unusual nature of the granular state of matter. Observations have been interpreted in terms of conflicting stopping forces: product of powers of projectile depth and speed; linear in speed; constant, proportional to the initial impact speed; and proportional to depth. This is reminiscent of high-speed ballistics impact in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when a plethora of empirical rules were proposed. To make progress, we developed a means to measure projectile dynamics with 100&#8201;nm and 20&#8201;&#956;s precision. For a 1-inch-diameter steel sphere dropped from a wide range of heights into non-cohesive glass beads, we reproduce previous observations either as reasonable approximations or as limiting behaviours. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interaction between the projectile and the medium can be decomposed into the sum of velocity-dependent inertial drag plus depth-dependent friction. Thus, we achieve a unified description of low-speed impact phenomena and show that the complex response of granular materials to impact, although fundamentally different from that of liquids and solids, can be simply understood.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6396, USA', 'authors': ['Hiroaki Katsuragi', '\xa0&\xa0Douglas J.

article,Plasma mirrors for ultrahigh-intensity optics,"<p>Specular reflection is one of the most fundamental processes of optics. At moderate light intensities generated by conventional light sources this process is well understood. But at those capable of being produced by modern ultrahigh-intensity lasers, many new and potentially useful phenomena arise. When a pulse from such a laser hits an optically polished surface, it generates a dense plasma that itself acts as a mirror, known as a plasma mirror (PM). PMs do not just reflect the remainder of the incident beam, but can act as active optical elements. Using a set of three consecutive PMs in different regimes, we significantly improve the temporal contrast of femtosecond pulses, and demonstrate that high-order harmonics of the laser frequency can be generated through two distinct mechanisms. A better understanding of these processes should aid the development of laser-driven attosecond sources for use in fields from materials science to molecular biology.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Service des Photons, Atomes et Molécules, Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique, DSM/DRECAM, CEN Saclay, 91191 Gif-sur-Yvette, France', 'authors': ['C.

article,Visible continuous emission from a silica microphotonic device by third-harmonic generation,"<p>Nonlinear harmonic generation is widely used to extend the emission wavelength of laser sources. These devices typically require high peak powers to generate sufficient nonlinear optical response. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and analyse theoretically continuous-wave, visible emission from a silica microresonator on a silicon chip by third-harmonic generation. Emission is observed with pump powers of less than 300&#8201;&#956;W, and is verified to scale cubically with pump power. We also observe third-order sum-frequency generation and mixing of the pump with a concomitant Raman laser within the same structure, giving rise to emission of various colours. In addition to providing low-power operation, this result opens the possibility of silicon microphotonic emitters spanning all the way down to the ultraviolet and operating continuously.</p>",,"[{'address': 'California Institute of Technology, 1200 E.
