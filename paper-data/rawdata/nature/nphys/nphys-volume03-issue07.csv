letter,Entangled Andreev pairs and collective excitations in nanoscale superconductors,"<p>Nanoscale superconductors connected to normal metallic electrodes provide a potential source of entangled electron pairs. Such states would arise from the splitting of Cooper pairs in the superconductor into two electrons with opposite spins, which then tunnel into different leads by means of a process known as crossed Andreev reflection (refs&#160;). In an actual system, the detection of these processes is hindered by the elastic transmission of individual electrons between the leads, which yields an opposite contribution to the non-local conductance. Here we demonstrate that low-energy collective excitations, which appear in superconducting structures of reduced dimensionality, can have a significant influence on the transport properties of this type of hybrid nanostructure. When an electron tunnels into the superconductor it can excite such low-energy excitations that alter the balance between the different electronic processes, leading to a dominance of one over the other depending on the spatial symmetry of these excitations. These findings help to clarify some intriguing experimental results and provide future strategies for the detection of entangled electron pairs in solid-state devices for quantum computation.</p>",[],True,"[""A.

letter,Acute enhancement of the upper critical field for superconductivity approaching a quantum critical point in URhGe,"<p>When a pure material is tuned to the point where a continuous phase-transition line is crossed at zero temperature, known as a quantum critical point (QCP), completely new correlated quantum ordered states can form. These phases include exotic forms of superconductivity. However, as superconductivity is generally suppressed by a magnetic field, the formation of superconductivity ought not to be possible at extremely high field. Here, we report that as we tune the ferromagnet, URhGe, towards a QCP by applying a component of magnetic field in the material&#8217;s easy magnetic plane, superconductivity survives in progressively higher fields applied simultaneously along the material&#8217;s magnetic hard axis. Thus, although superconductivity never occurs above a temperature of 0.5&#8201;K, we find that it can survive in extremely high magnetic fields, exceeding 28&#8201;T.</p>",[],True,"[""F.

letter,Imaging magnetic focusing of coherent electron waves,"<p>The coherent flow of electrons through a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) offers promising approaches for spintronics and quantum information processing. Cryogenic scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) are a valuable tool for imaging electron motion, but have been limited by their inability to follow such motion through an open structure under an applied magnetic field. Here we report a way to visualize the flow of electron waves from one point to another by using the SPM tip to create a lens in the 2DEG below. The lens deflects electrons and casts a shadow downstream. We use this technique to image magnetic focusing in a GaAs 2DEG. Magnetic focusing occurs when electrons flowing from one quantum point contact (QPC) rejoin at a second QPC a number of cyclotron diameters away. Our images show semicircular trajectories as the electrons bounce along the boundary, as well as fringes created by the interference of multiple paths, demonstrating that the flow is coherent. Remarkable agreement between experiment and theory demonstrates our ability to visualize electron trajectories in a magnetic field, and to make a new type of imaging electron&#160;interferometer.</p>",[],True,"[""Katherine E.

letter,Universal thermodynamics of strongly interacting Fermi gases,"<p>Strongly interacting Fermi gases are of great current interest. Not only are fermions the most common particles in the universe, but they are also thought to have a universal thermodynamic behaviour for strong interactions. Recent experiments on ultracold Fermi gases provide an unprecedented opportunity to test universality in the laboratory. In principle this allows&#8212;for example&#8212;the interior properties of hot, dense neutron stars to be investigated on earth. Here we carry out a detailed test of this prediction. We analyse results from three ultracold fermion experiments involving two completely distinct atomic species in different kinds of atomic-trap environment. The data are compared with the predictions of a recent strong-interaction theory. Excellent agreement is obtained, with no adjustable parameters. By extrapolating to zero temperature, we show that the experimental measurements yield a many-body parameter &#946;&#8771;&#8722;0.59&#177;0.07, describing the universal energy of strongly interacting Fermi gases.</p>",[],True,"[""Hui Hu"", ""Peter D.

letter,Structure of phase III of solid hydrogen,"<p>Hydrogen, being the first element in the periodic table, has the simplest electronic structure of any atom, and the hydrogen molecule contains the simplest covalent chemical bond. Nevertheless, the phase diagram of hydrogen is poorly understood. Determining the stable structures of solid hydrogen is a tremendous experimental challenge, because hydrogen atoms scatter X-rays only weakly, leading to low-resolution diffraction patterns. Theoretical studies encounter major difficulties owing to the small energy differences between structures and the importance of the zero-point motion of the protons. We have systematically investigated the zero-temperature phase diagram of solid hydrogen using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) electronic-structure methods, including the proton zero-point motion at the harmonic level. Our study leads to a radical revision of the DFT phase diagram of hydrogen up to nearly 400&#8201;GPa. That the most stable phases remain insulating to very high pressures eliminates a major discrepancy between theory and experiment. One of our new phases is calculated to be stable over a wide range of pressures, and its vibrational properties agree with the available experimental data for phase III.</p>",[],True,"[""Chris J.

letter,Parallel and selective trapping in a patterned plasmonic landscape,"<p>The implementation of optical tweezers at a surface opens a huge potential towards the elaboration of future lab-on-a-chip devices entirely operated with light. The transition from conventional three-dimensional (3D) tweezers to 2D is made possible by exploiting evanescent fields bound at interfaces. In particular, surface plasmons (SP) at metal/dielectric interfaces are expected to be excellent candidates to relax the requirements on incident power and to achieve subwavelength trapping volumes. Here, we report on novel 2D SP-based optical tweezers formed by finite gold areas fabricated at a glass surface. We demonstrate that SP enable stable trapping of single dielectric beads under non-focused illumination with considerably reduced laser intensity compared with conventional optical tweezers. We show that the method can be extended to parallel trapping over any predefined pattern. Finally, we demonstrate how SP tweezers can be designed to selectively trap one type of particles out of a mixture, acting as an efficient optical sieve.</p>",[],True,"[""Maurizio Righini"", ""Anna S.

In view of applications such as quantum cryptography or quantum teleportation, extension of quantum-entanglement-based protocols to global distances is of considerable practical interest.

One photon is measured locally at the Canary Island of La&#160;Palma, whereas the other is sent over an optical free-space link to Tenerife, where the Optical Ground Station of the European Space Agency acts as the receiver.

article,Order-by-disorder and spiral spin-liquid in frustrated diamond-lattice antiferromagnets,"<p>Frustration refers to competition between different interactions that cannot be simultaneously satisfied&#8212;a familiar feature in many magnetic solids. Strong frustration leads to highly degenerate ground states and a large suppression of ordering by fluctuations. Key challenges in frustrated magnetism include the characterization of the fluctuating spin-liquid regime and determination of the mechanism of eventual order at lower temperature. Here, we study a model of a diamond-lattice antiferromagnet appropriate for numerous spinel materials. With sufficiently strong frustration, a massive ground-state degeneracy develops amongst spirals whose propagation wavevectors reside on a continuous two-dimensional &#8216;spiral surface&#8217; in momentum space. We argue that an important ordering mechanism is entropic splitting of the degenerate ground states, an elusive phenomenon called &#8216;order by disorder&#8217;. A broad spiral spin-liquid regime emerges at higher temperatures, where the underlying spiral surface can be directly revealed through spin correlations.

article,Shaped angular dependence of the spin-transfer torque and microwave generation without magnetic field,"<p>The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of the most important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the spin-transfer phenomenon, which is the reorientation of the magnetization of a ferromagnetic domain by spin-polarized current. Here we report transport and microwave power measurements on specially designed nanopillars, for which a non-standard angular dependence of the spin-transfer torque is predicted by theoretical models. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized by large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field. This is also predicted by simulations including a &#8216;wavy&#8217; angular dependence of the torque. This type of nanopillar, which is able to generate microwave oscillations in zero applied magnetic field, could represent an interesting method for the implementation of spin-transfer oscillators.

article,Magnetic vortex oscillator driven by d.c. spin-polarized current,"<p>Transfer of angular momentum from a spin-polarized current to a ferromagnet provides an efficient means to control the magnetization dynamics of nanomagnets. A peculiar consequence of this spin torque, the ability to induce persistent oscillations in a nanomagnet by applying a d.c. current, has previously been reported only for spatially uniform nanomagnets. Here, we demonstrate that a quintessentially non-uniform magnetic structure, a magnetic vortex, isolated within a nanoscale spin-valve structure, can be excited into persistent microwave-frequency oscillations by a spin-polarized d.c. current. Comparison with micromagnetic simulations leads to identification of the oscillations with a precession of the vortex core. The oscillations, which can be obtained in essentially zero magnetic field, exhibit linewidths that can be narrower than 300&#8201;kHz at &#8764;1.1&#8201;GHz, making these highly compact spin-torque vortex-oscillator devices potential candidates for microwave signal-processing applications, and a powerful new tool for fundamental studies of vortex dynamics in magnetic nanostructures.</p>",[],False,"[""V.
