review article,Self-similarity in ultrafast nonlinear optics,"<p>Recent developments in nonlinear optics have led to the discovery of a new class of ultrashort pulse, the &#8216;optical similariton&#8217;. Optical similaritons arise when the interaction of nonlinearity, dispersion and gain in a high-power fibre amplifier causes the shape of an arbitrary input pulse to converge asymptotically to a pulse whose shape is self-similar. In comparison with optical solitons, which rely on a delicate balance of nonlinearity and anomalous dispersion and which can become unstable with increasing intensity, similaritons are more robust at high pulse powers. The simplicity and widespread availability of the components needed to build a self-similar amplifier capable of producing optical similaritons provides a convenient experimental platform to explore the fundamental nature of dynamical self-similarity. Here, we provide an overview of self-similar pulse propagation and scaling in optical fibre amplifiers, and their use in the development of high-power ultrafast optical sources, pulse synthesis and all-optical pulse regeneration.</p>",[],False,"[""John M.

letter,Inside-out evacuation of transitional protoplanetary discs by the magneto-rotational instability,"<p>A newborn star is encircled by a remnant disc of gas and dust. A fraction of the disc coalesces into planets. Another fraction spirals inward and accretes onto the star. Accreting gas not only produces observed ultraviolet radiation, but also drags along embedded planets, helping to explain otherwise mysterious features of observed extrasolar systems. What drives disc accretion has remained uncertain. The magneto-rotational instability (MRI), driven by coupling between magnetic fields and disc rotation, supplies a powerful means of transport, but protoplanetary disc gas might be too poorly ionized to couple to magnetic fields. Here we show that the MRI explains the observed accretion rates of newly discovered transitional discs, which are swept clean of dust inside rim radii of &#8764;10&#8201;AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize the disc rim, activating the MRI there. Gas flows steadily from the rim to the star, at a rate set by the depth to which X-rays ionize the rim wall. Blown out by radiation pressure, dust largely fails to accrete with gas. Our picture supplies one concrete setting for theories of how planets grow and have their orbits shaped by disc gas, and when combined with photo-evaporative disc winds provides a framework for understanding how discs dissipate.</p>",[],True,"[""Eugene Chiang"", ""Ruth Murray-Clay""]","Chiang, E., Murray-Clay, R.

letter,Satellite observations of separator-line geometry of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection,"<p>Detection of a separator line that connects magnetic nulls and the determination of the dynamics and plasma environment of such a structure can improve our understanding of the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic reconnection process. However, this type of field and particle configuration has not been directly observed in space plasmas. Here we report the identification of a pair of nulls, the null&#8211;null line that connects them, and associated fans and spines in the magnetotail of the Earth using data from the four Cluster spacecraft. With d<sub>i</sub> and d<sub>e</sub> designating the ion and electron inertial lengths, respectively, the separation between the nulls is found to be &#8764;0.7&#177;0.3d<sub>i</sub> and an associated oscillation is identified as a lower-hybrid wave with wavelength &#8764;d<sub>e</sub>.

letter,The energization of relativistic electrons in the outer Van Allen radiation belt,"<p>The origin and dynamics of the Van Allen radiation belts is one of the longest-standing questions of the space age, and one that is increasingly important for space applications as satellite systems become more sophisticated, smaller and more susceptible to radiation effects. The precise mechanism by which the Earth&#8217;s magnetosphere is able to accelerate electrons from thermal to ultrarelativistic energies (E&#8811;0.5&#8201;MeV) has been particularly difficult to definitively resolve. The traditional explanation is that large-scale, fluctuating electric and magnetic fields energize particles through radial diffusion. More recent theories and observations have suggested that gyro-resonant wave&#8211;particle interactions may be comparable to or more important than radial diffusion. Using data collected simultaneously by multiple satellites passing through the magnetosphere at different distances from the Earth, we demonstrate that the latter of these is the dominant mechanism responsible for relativistic electron acceleration. Specifically, we identify frequent and persistent peaks in equatorial electron phase space density near or inside geosynchronous orbit that provide unambiguous evidence for local wave&#8211;particle acceleration. These observations represent an important step towards a more complete physical understanding of radiation belt dynamics and to the development of space-weather models.</p>",[],True,"[""Yue Chen"", ""Geoffrey D.

On the other hand, well below T<sup>*</sup>, their Fermi surfaces can be explained by the &#8216;itinerant&#8217; f-electron model. These two models assume totally different natures of the f electrons, and how they transform between these states as a function of temperature has never been understood at the level of their electronic structures. Here, we use angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to study the band structure of the heavy-fermion antiferromagnetic superconductor UPd<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>3</sub> below and above T<sup>*</sup>, and find that the f bands, which form the Fermi surfaces at low temperatures, are excluded from the Fermi surfaces at high temperatures.

letter,Observation of Landau levels of Dirac fermions in graphite,"<p>The unique electronic behaviour of monolayer and bilayer graphene is a result of the unusual quantum-relativistic characteristics of the so-called &#8216;Dirac fermions&#8217; (DFs) that carry charge in these materials. Although DFs in monolayer graphene move as if they were massless, and in bilayer graphene they do so with non-zero mass, all DFs show chirality, which gives rise to an unusual Landau level (LL) energy spectrum and the observation of an anomalous quantum Hall effect in both types of graphene. Here we report low-temperature scanning tunnelling spectra of graphite subjected to a magnetic field of up to 12&#8201;T, which provide the first direct observations of the LLs that produce such behaviour. Unexpectedly, we find evidence for the coexistence of both massless and massive DFs in graphite, and confirm the quantum-relativistic nature of these quasiparticles through the appearance of a zero-energy LL.</p>",[],True,"[""Guohong Li"", ""Eva Y.

letter,Observation of the optical spin Hall effect,"<p>The spin Hall effect consists of the generation of a spin current perpendicular to the charge current flow. Thirty-five years after its prediction by Dyakonov and Perel&#8217;, it is the focus of experimental and theoretical investigations and constitutes one of the most remarkable effects of spintronics. Owing to scattering and dephasing in electronic gases, it is difficult to observe and has only been demonstrated for the first time a few years ago. Recently, three of us have predicted the optical spin Hall effect, which consists of a separation in real space and momentum space of spin-polarized exciton&#8211;polaritons generated by a laser in a semiconductor microcavity. The separation takes place owing to a combination of elastic scattering of exciton&#8211;polaritons by structural disorder and an effective magnetic field coming from polarization splitting of the polariton states. The excitonic spin current is controlled by the linear polarization of the laser pump. Here, we report the first experimental evidence for this effect and demonstrate propagation of polariton spin currents over 100&#8201;&#956;m in a high-quality GaAs/AlGaAs quantum microcavity.

letter,All-optical injection of ballistic electrical currents in unbiased silicon,"<p>Silicon has been the dominant material in electronics since the invention of the integrated transistor. In contrast, silicon&#8217;s indirect bandgap and vanishing second-order optical nonlinearity limit its applications in optoelectronics. Although all-optical components such as Raman lasers, parametric amplifiers and electro-optic modulators have recently been reported, control over charge motion in silicon has only ever been achieved electronically. Here, we report all-optical generation of ultrafast ballistic electrical currents in clean, unbiased, bulk silicon at room temperature. This current injection, which provides new insights into optical processes in silicon, results from quantum interference between one- and two-photon absorption pathways across the indirect bandgap despite phonon participation and the multi-valley conduction band. The transient currents induced by 150&#8201;fs pulses are detected via the emitted THz radiation.

letter,Bridging length scales in colloidal liquids and interfaces from near-critical divergence to single particles,"<p>Boiling and condensation are among the best recognized phase transitions of condensed matter. Approaching the critical point, a liquid becomes indistinguishable from its vapour, the interfacial thickness diverges and the system is dominated by long-wavelength density fluctuations. Long wavelength usually means hundreds of particle diameters, but here we consider the limits of this assumption, using a mesoscopic analogue of simple liquids, a colloid&#8211;polymer mixture. We simultaneously visualize both the colloidal particles and near-critical density fluctuations, and reveal particle-level images of the critical clusters and liquid&#8211;gas interface. Surprisingly, we find that critical scaling does not break down until the correlation length approaches the size of the constituent particles, where there is a smooth transition to non-critical classical behaviour.

letter,Charge inversion accompanies DNA condensation by multivalent ions,"<p>The condensation of stiff, highly charged DNA molecules into compact structures by condensing agents ranging from multivalent ions to small cationic proteins is of major biological and therapeutic importance, yet the underlying microscopic mechanism remains poorly understood. It has been proposed that DNA condensation is a purely electrostatic phenomenon driven by the existence of a strongly correlated liquid (SCL) of counterions at the DNA surface. The same theoretical argument predicts that multivalent counterions overcompensate the DNA charge when present at high concentration, in turn destabilizing the condensates. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of DNA charge inversion by multivalent ions through measurements of the electrophoretic mobility of condensed DNA. By observing the multivalent-ion-induced condensation of a single DNA molecule using magnetic tweezers, we further show that charge inversion influences condensation by modulating the barrier for condensate nucleation in a manner consistent with the SCL mechanism.</p>",[],True,"[""K.

article,Symmetry of large physical systems implies independence of subsystems,"<p>Composite systems consisting of a large number of similar subsystems play an important role in many areas of physics as well as in information theory. Their analysis, however, often relies on the assumption that the subsystems are mutually independent (or only weakly correlated). Here, we show that this assumption is generally justified for quantum systems that are symmetric, that is, invariant under permutations of the subsystems. Because symmetry is often implied by natural properties, for example, the indistinguishability of identical particles, the result has a wide range of consequences. In particular, it implies that global properties of a large composite system can be estimated by measurements applied to a limited number of (randomly chosen) sample subsystems, a fact that is important for the interpretation of experimental data. Moreover, it generalizes statements in quantum information theory and cryptography, which previously have only been known to hold under certain independence assumptions.</p>",[],False,"[""Renato Renner""]","Renner, R.

article,Measurement of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin–orbit magnetic fields,"<p>Spin&#8211;orbit coupling is a manifestation of special relativity. In the reference frame of a moving electron, electric fields transform into magnetic fields, which interact with the electron spin and lift the degeneracy of spin-up and spin-down states. In solid-state systems, the resulting spin&#8211;orbit fields are referred to as Dresselhaus and Rashba fields, depending on whether the electric fields originate from bulk or structure inversion asymmetry, respectively. Yet, it remains a challenge to determine the absolute value of both contributions in a single sample. Here, we show that both fields can be measured by optically monitoring the angular dependence of the electrons&#8217; spin precession on their direction of motion with respect to the crystal lattice. Furthermore, we demonstrate spin resonance induced by the spin&#8211;orbit fields.

The model predicts many features observed in measurements of cellular forces and orientation including the increase with time of the cellular forces in the absence of applied stress and the consequent decrease of the force in the presence of quasi-static stresses.
