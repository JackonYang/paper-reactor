letter,Is the outer Solar System chaotic?,"<p>The existence of chaos among the jovian planets is a contested issue. There exists both apparently unassailable evidence that the outer Solar System is chaotic, and that it is not. The discrepancy is particularly disturbing given that computed chaos is sometimes due to numerical artefacts. Here, we discount the possibility of numerical artefacts and demonstrate that the discrepancy seen between various investigators is real. It is caused by observational uncertainty in the orbital positions of the jovian planets, which is currently a few parts in 10&#8201;million. Within that observational uncertainty, there exist clearly chaotic trajectories with complex structure and Lyapunov times&#8212;the timescale for the onset of chaos&#8212;ranging from 2&#8201;million years to 230&#8201;million years, as well as trajectories that show no evidence of chaos over 1&#8201;Gyr timescales. Determining the true Lyapunov time of the outer Solar System will require a more accurate observational determination of the orbits of the jovian planets. A full understanding of the nature and consequences of the chaos may require further theoretical development.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Computer Science Department, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3435, USA', 'authors': ['Wayne B.

letter,Entangling independent photons by time measurement,"<p>Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be &#8216;swapped&#8217;: if we prepare two independent entangled pairs A1&#8211;A2 and B1&#8211;B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a &#8216;Bell-state measurement&#8217;, BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted nor share any common past. Entanglement swapping with photon pairs has already been experimentally demonstrated using pulsed sources&#8212;where the challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM&#8212;but never with continuous-wave sources, as originally proposed. Here, we present an experiment where the coherence time of the photons exceeds the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence, photon timing can be obtained by the detection times, and pulsed sources can be replaced by continuous-wave sources, which do not require any synchronization. This allows for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources, an important step towards real-world quantum networks with truly independent and distant nodes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Group of Applied Physics, University of Geneva, 20, rue de l’Ecole-de-Médecine, 1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Matthäus Halder', ',\xa0Alexios Beveratos', ',\xa0Nicolas Gisin', ',\xa0Valerio Scarani', ',\xa0Christoph Simon', '\xa0&\xa0Hugo Zbinden']}]",True,"['Matthäus Halder', 'Alexios Beveratos', 'Nicolas Gisin', 'Valerio Scarani', 'Christoph Simon', 'Hugo Zbinden']","Halder, M., Beveratos, A., Gisin, N. et al.

letter,Two-dimensional transport and transfer of a single atomic qubit in optical tweezers,"<p>Quantum computers have the capability of out-performing their classical counterparts for certain computational problems. Several scalable quantum-computing architectures have been proposed. An attractive architecture is a large set of physically independent qubits arranged in three spatial regions where (1)&#160;the initialized qubits are stored in a register, (2) two qubits are brought together to realize a gate and (3) the readout of the qubits is carried out. For a neutral-atom-based architecture, a natural way to connect these regions is to use optical tweezers to move qubits within the system. In this letter we demonstrate the coherent transport of a qubit, encoded on an atom trapped in a submicrometre tweezer, over a distance typical of the separation between atoms in an array of optical traps. Furthermore, we transfer a qubit between two tweezers, and show that this manipulation also preserves the coherence of the qubit.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire Charles Fabry de l’Institut d’Optique, CNRS, Univ.

letter,Quantum critical behaviour in the superfluid density of strongly underdoped ultrathin copper oxide films,"<p>A central challenge in the physics of high-temperature superconductors is to understand superconductivity within a single copper oxide layer or bilayer, the fundamental structural unit, and how superconductivity is lost with underdoping of charge carriers. A seminal property of crystals and thick films is that when mobile holes are removed from optimally doped CuO<sub>2</sub> planes, the transition temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, and superfluid density, n<sub>s</sub>(0), decrease in a surprisingly correlated fashion. We elucidate the essential physics of strongly underdoped bilayers by studying two-dimensional (2D) samples near the critical doping level where superconductivity disappears. We report measurements of n<sub>s</sub>(T) in films of Y<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>Ca<sub>x</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7&#8722;&#948;</sub> as thin as two copper oxide bilayers with T<sub>c</sub> values as low as 3&#8201;K. In addition to seeing the 2D Kosterlitz&#8211;Thouless&#8211;Berezinski transition at T<sub>c</sub>, we observe a remarkable scaling of T<sub>c</sub> with n<sub>s</sub>(0), which indicates that the disappearance of superconductivity with underdoping is due to quantum fluctuations near a 2D quantum critical point.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA', 'authors': ['Iulian Hetel', ',\xa0Thomas R.

letter,Incoherent non-Fermi-liquid scattering in a Kondo lattice,"<p>One of the most notorious non-Fermi-liquid properties of both archetypal heavy-fermion systems and the high-T<sub>c</sub> copper oxide superconductors is an electrical resistivity that evolves linearly (rather than quadratically) with temperature, T. In the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn<sub>5</sub> (ref.&#160;), this linear behaviour was one of the first indications of the presence of a zero-temperature instability, or quantum critical point. Here, we report the observation of a unique control parameter of T-linear scattering in CeCoIn<sub>5</sub>, found through systematic chemical substitutions of both magnetic and non-magnetic rare-earth, R, ions into the Ce sublattice. We find that the evolution of inelastic scattering in Ce<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>R<sub>x</sub>CoIn<sub>5</sub> is strongly dependent on the f-electron configuration of the R ion, whereas two other key properties&#8212;Cooper-pair breaking and Kondo-lattice coherence&#8212;are not. Thus, T-linear resistivity in CeCoIn<sub>5</sub> is intimately related to the nature of incoherent scattering centres in the Kondo lattice, which provides insight into the anomalous scattering rate synonymous with quantum criticality.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA', 'authors': ['Johnpierre Paglione', ',\xa0T.

letter,Flow diagram of the metal–insulator transition in two dimensions,"<p>The discovery of the metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) in two-dimensional electron systems challenged the veracity of one of the most influential conjectures in the physics of disordered electrons, which states that &#8216;in two dimensions, there is no true metallic behaviour&#8217;; no matter how weak the disorder, electrons would be trapped and unable to conduct a current. However, that theory did not account for interactions between the electrons. Here, we investigate the interplay between the electron&#8211;electron interactions and disorder near the MIT using simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity and magnetoconductance. We show that both the resistance and interaction amplitude exhibit a fan-like spread as the MIT is crossed. From these data, we construct a resistance&#8211;interaction flow diagram of the MIT that clearly reveals a quantum critical point, as predicted by the two-parameter scaling theory. The metallic side of this diagram is accurately described by the renormalization-group theory without any fitting parameters. In particular, the metallic temperature dependence of the resistance sets in when the interaction amplitude reaches &#947;<sub>2</sub>&#8776;0.45&#8212;a value in remarkable agreement with the one predicted by theory.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics Department, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA', 'authors': ['S.

Coherence experiments with complex objects are of interest for exploring the transition to classical physics, for measuring molecular properties, and they have even been proposed for testing new models of space-time. For matter-wave experiments with complex molecules, the strongly dispersive effect of the interaction between the diffracted molecule and the grating wall is a major challenge because it imposes enormous constraints on the velocity selection of the molecular beam.

article,Charge-order-maximized momentum-dependent superconductivity,"<p>Charge ordering and superconductivity are observed in the phase diagrams of a variety of materials such as NbSe<sub>3</sub>, layered transition-metal dichalcogenides and high-temperature copper oxide superconductors, low-dimensional organics, Ba<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>K<sub>x</sub>BiO<sub>3</sub> and so forth. Although both conventional charge-density-wave (CDW) and superconducting transitions show an energy gap in the single-particle density of states at the Fermi level (E<sub>F</sub>), their physical properties are poles apart: insulating behaviour for the CDW and zero resistivity in superconductors. Consequently, these two ground states are believed to compete with each other. Here we provide evidence for maximized superconductivity at points in momentum (k) space that are directly connected by the CDW ordering vector. Temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of 2H-NbSe<sub>2</sub> across the CDW and superconducting transitions (T<sub>CDW</sub>&#8764;33&#8201;K and T<sub>c</sub>=7.2&#8201;K, respectively) shows CDW-induced spectral-weight depletion at the same Fermi-surface-crossing k points, which evolve into the largest superconducting gaps. These k points also show the highest electron&#8211;phonon coupling and lowest Fermi velocities. Our results demonstrate that charge order can boost superconductivity in an electron&#8211;phonon coupled system, in direct contrast to the prevailing view that it only competes with superconductivity.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP), University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8581, Japan', 'authors': ['T.

article,Three-body interactions with cold polar molecules,"<p>Fundamental interactions between particles, such as the Coulomb law, involve pairs of particles, and our understanding of the plethora of phenomena in condensed-matter physics rests on models involving effective two-body interactions. On the other hand, exotic quantum phases, such as topological phases or spin liquids, are often identified as ground states of hamiltonians with three- or more-body terms. Although the study of these phases and the properties of their excitations is currently one of the most exciting developments in theoretical condensed-matter physics, it is difficult to identify real physical systems exhibiting such properties. Here, we show that polar molecules in optical lattices driven by microwave fields naturally give rise to Hubbard models with strong nearest-neighbour three-body interactions, whereas the two-body terms can be tuned with external fields. This may open a new route for an experimental study of exotic quantum phases with quantum degenerate molecular gases.</p>",,"[{'address': '', 'authors': ['H. P. Büchler']}]",False,"['H. P.

article,A new method for generating ultraintense and ultrashort laser pulses,"<p>The output power of any laser system is limited by the power that any of its individual components can withstand without being destroyed. This increases the size, complexity and cost of next-generation lasers built using conventional optical-gain media. But by using a plasma, which is impervious to optical damage, as the gain medium, such limitations could be significantly surpassed. Here, we report the use of stimulated Raman backscattering in a millimetre-scale plasma to simultaneously amplify and compress an input pulse to increase its intensity by more than two orders of magnitude. Further amplification and compression of such a pulse was achieved by passing it twice through our system, an approach that could be readily extended in future with a cavity-like multipass design. Such an approach could enable the construction of a new generation of compact, low-cost ultrahigh-intensity laser systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA', 'authors': ['Jun Ren', ',\xa0Weifeng Cheng', ',\xa0Shuanglei Li', '\xa0&\xa0Szymon Suckewer']}]",False,"['Jun Ren', 'Weifeng Cheng', 'Shuanglei Li', 'Szymon Suckewer']","Ren, J., Cheng, W., Li, S. et al.A new method for generating ultraintense and ultrashort laser pulses.

article,Focusing capillary jets close to the continuum limit,"<p>The demand for techniques that can reliably deliver and control nanometre-scale volumes of liquid is a growing priority in biotechnology and medicine. Capillary jets are capable of supplying a steady stream of monodisperse liquid droplets. But because of the increasing forces and pressures needed to counteract surface tension for droplets of decreasing size, reaching the nanoscale with such an approach is difficult. One way of overcoming such limitations is to electrostatically focus a jet as it emerges from a capillary. Another, which we report here, is to focus such a jet by hydrodynamic means, a double flow-focusing arrangement that involves a manifold capillary that delivers a second immiscible fluid jet that envelopes and guides the jet from an inner capillary. Under the appropriate working conditions, this enables the generation of continuous steady capillary fluid jets down to submicrometre diameter&#8212;approaching the ultimate continuum limit, which is supported by a proposed theory.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Aerospace Engineering and Fluid Mechanics, ESI, Universidad de Sevilla, 41092 Sevilla, Spain', 'authors': ['Alfonso M.
