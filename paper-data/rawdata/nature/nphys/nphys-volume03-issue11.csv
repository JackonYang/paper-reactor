An ensemble of atoms can store a quantum state in the form of a magnon&#8212;which is a quantized collective spin excitation&#8212;that can be mapped onto a photon with high efficiency. Here, we report the phase-coherent transfer of a single magnon from one atomic ensemble to another via an optical resonator serving as a quantum bus that in the ideal case is only virtually populated.

letter,Optically detected coherent spin dynamics of a single electron in a quantum dot,"<p>The ability to sequentially initialize, manipulate and read out the state of a qubit, such as an electron spin in a quantum dot (QD), is a requirement in virtually any scheme for quantum information processing. However, previous optical measurements of a single electron spin have focused on time-averaged detection, with the spin being initialized and read out continuously. Here, we monitor the coherent evolution of an electron spin in a single QD. We use time-resolved Kerr rotation (KR) spectroscopy, an all-optical, non-destructive technique that enables us to monitor the precession of the spin in a superposition of Zeeman-split sublevels with nanosecond time resolution. The data show an exponential decay of the spin polarization with time, and directly reveal the g-factor and spin lifetime of the electron in the QD. Furthermore, the observed spin dynamics provide a sensitive probe of the local nuclear spin environment.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Spintronics and Quantum Computation, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA', 'authors': ['M.

letter,Peculiar many-body effects revealed in the spectroscopy of highly charged quantum dots,"<p>Coulomb interactions between electrons lead to the observed multiplet structure and breakdown of the Aufbau principle for atomic d and f shells. Nevertheless, these effects can disappear in extended systems. For instance, the multiplet structure of atomic carbon is not a feature of graphite or diamond. A quantum dot is an extended system containing &#8764;10<sup>6</sup> atoms for which electron&#8211;electron interactions do survive and the interplay between the Coulomb energy, J, and the quantization energy, &#916;E, is crucial to Coulomb blockade. We have discovered consequences of Coulomb interactions in self-assembled quantum dots by interpreting experimental spectra with an atomistic calculation. The Coulomb effects, evident in the photon emission process, are tunable in situ by controlling the quantum dot charge from +6e to &#8722;6e. The same dot shows two regimes: J&#8804;&#916;E for electron charging yet J&#8771;&#916;E for hole charging. We find a breakdown of the Aufbau principle for holes; clear proof of non-perturbative hole&#8211;hole interactions; promotion&#8211;demotion processes in the final state of the emission process, effects first predicted a decade ago; and pronounced configuration hybridizations in the initial state.

letter,Spin dynamics in the pseudogap state of a high-temperature superconductor,"<p>The pseudogap is one of the most pervasive phenomena of high-temperature superconductors. It is attributed either to incoherent Cooper pairing setting in above the superconducting transition temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, or to a hidden order parameter competing with superconductivity. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering from underdoped YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6.6</sub>&#160;to show that the dispersion relations of spin excitations in the superconducting and pseudogap states are qualitatively different. Specifically, the extensively studied &#8216;hour glass&#8217; shape of the magnetic dispersions in the superconducting state is no longer discernible in the pseudogap state and we observe an unusual &#8216;vertical&#8217; dispersion with pronounced in-plane anisotropy. The differences between superconducting and pseudogap states are thus more profound than generally believed, suggesting a competition between these two states. Whereas the high-energy excitations are common to both states and obey the symmetry of the copper oxide square lattice, the low-energy excitations in the pseudogap state may be indicative of collective fluctuations towards a state with broken orientational symmetry predicted in theoretical work.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany', 'authors': ['V.

letter,Impurity-stabilized solid 4He below the solidification pressure of pure helium,"<p>The modification of melting temperatures and pressures by dissolved impurities is well known in classical fluids. However, to our knowledge such effects have never been studied in quantum solids because of the difficulties in introducing impurities into such crystals that exist only at cryogenic temperatures, and, in the case of <sup>4</sup>He, at pressures exceeding 25&#8201;bar. Here, we present an effect that occurs during the melting of solid <sup>4</sup>He doped with nanoscopic impurities (alkali atoms, clusters, ions and electrons): the doped part of the crystal remains solid under conditions at which pure helium is liquid. Using interferometry, we found that the density of the solid structure lies between the densities of pure liquid and pure solid helium.

article,Spinons and triplons in spatially anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets,"<p>The search for elementary excitations with fractional quantum numbers is a central challenge in modern condensed-matter physics. It has long been speculated that two-dimensional frustrated magnets might support quantum disordered states with neutral spin-1/2 excitations known as spinons. Despite decades of search, however, no clear experimental examples have been found. We explore the possibility for several materials using a realistic model, the spin-1/2 spatially anisotropic frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions. Here, we derive an effective Schr&#246;dinger equation valid in the weak interchain coupling regime. The dynamical spin correlations from this approach agree quantitatively without fitting parameters with inelastic neutron measurements of the triangular antiferromagnet Cs<sub>2</sub>CuCl<sub>4</sub>. In such antiferromagnets, the spectrum is composed of an incoherent continuum arising from the effects of one-dimensional spinons of individual chains, and a sharp dispersing peak, due to coherently propagating &#8216;triplon&#8217; bound states of two spinons. We argue that triplons are generic features of spatially anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets, which arise because the bound spinon pair lowers its kinetic energy by propagating between chains.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA', 'authors': ['Masanori Kohno', '\xa0&\xa0Leon Balents']}, {'address': 'Computational Materials Science Center, National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba 305-0047, Japan', 'authors': ['Masanori Kohno']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112, USA', 'authors': ['Oleg A.

article,Anyons in a weakly interacting system,"<p>In quantum theory, indistinguishable particles in three-dimensional space behave in only two distinct ways. On interchange, their wavefunction maps either to itself if the particles are bosons, or to minus itself if they are fermions. In two dimensions, a more exotic possibility arises: on exchange of two particles known as anyons, the wavefunction acquires the phase . Such fractional exchange statistics are normally regarded as the hallmark of strong correlations. Here, we describe a theoretical proposal for a system whose excitations are anyons with the exchange phase &#952;=&#960;/4 and charge &#177;e/2, but at the same time can be built by filling a set of single-particle states of essentially non-interacting electrons.

article,Imaging the two gaps of the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CuO6+x,"<p>The nature and behaviour of electronic states in high-temperature superconductors are the centre of much debate. The pseudogap state, observed above the superconducting transition temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, is seen by some as a precursor to the superconducting state. Others view it as a competing phase. Recently, this discussion has focused on the number of energy gaps in the system. Some experiments indicate a single energy gap, implying that the pseudogap is a precursor state. Others indicate two, suggesting that it is a competing or coexisting phase. Here, we use temperature-dependent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy of (Bi<sub>1&#8722;y</sub>Pb<sub>y</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>6+x</sub> to clarify the situation. We find a previously unobserved narrow and homogeneous gap that vanishes near T<sub>c</sub>, superimposed on the typically observed inhomogeneous and broad gap, which is only weakly temperature dependent.

article,A single-photon transistor using nanoscale surface plasmons,"<p>Photons rarely interact&#8212;which makes it challenging to build all-optical devices in which one light signal controls another. Even in nonlinear optical media, in which two beams can interact because of their influence on the medium&#8217;s refractive index, this interaction is weak at low light levels. Here, we propose a novel approach to realizing strong nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level, by exploiting the strong coupling between individual optical emitters and propagating surface plasmons confined to a conducting nanowire. We show that this system can act as a nonlinear two-photon switch for incident photons propagating along the nanowire, which can be coherently controlled using conventional quantum-optical techniques. Furthermore, we discuss how the interaction can be tailored to create a single-photon transistor, where the presence (or absence) of a single incident photon in a &#8216;gate&#8217; field is sufficient to allow (or prevent) the propagation of subsequent &#8216;signal&#8217; photons along the wire.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics Department, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA', 'authors': ['Darrick E.

article,Self-organized network evolution coupled to extremal dynamics,"<p>The interplay between topology and dynamics in complex networks is a fundamental but widely unexplored problem. Here, we study this phenomenon on a prototype model in which the network is shaped by a dynamical variable. We couple the dynamics of the Bak&#8211;Sneppen evolution model with the rules of the so-called fitness network model for establishing the topology of a network; each vertex is assigned a &#8216;fitness&#8217;, and the vertex with minimum fitness and its neighbours are updated in each iteration. At the same time, the links between the updated vertices and all other vertices are drawn anew with a fitness-dependent connection probability. We show analytically and numerically that the system self-organizes to a non-trivial state that differs from what is obtained when the two processes are decoupled. A power-law decay of dynamical and topological quantities above a threshold emerges spontaneously, as well as a feedback between different dynamical regimes and the underlying correlation and percolation properties of the network.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Dipartimento di Fisica, Università di Siena, Via Roma 56, 53100 Siena, Italy', 'authors': ['Diego Garlaschelli']}, {'address': 'Centro Studi e Ricerche e Museo della Fisica, ‘E.
