letter,Unexpected features of branched flow through high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases,"<p>GaAs-based two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) show a wealth of remarkable electronic states, and serve as the basis for fast transistors, research on electrons in nanostructures and prototypes of quantum-computing schemes. All of these uses depend on the extremely low levels of disorder in GaAs 2DEGs, with low-temperature mean free paths ranging from micrometres to hundreds of micrometres. Here we study how disorder affects the spatial structure of electron transport by imaging electron flow in three different GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEGs, whose mobilities range over an order of magnitude. As expected, electrons flow along narrow branches that we find remain straight over a distance roughly proportional to the mean free path. We also observe two unanticipated phenomena in high-mobility samples. In our highest-mobility sample we observe an almost complete absence of sharp impurity or defect scattering, indicated by the complete suppression of quantum coherent interference fringes. Also, branched flow through the chaotic potential of a high-mobility sample remains stable to significant changes to the initial conditions of injected electrons.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA', 'authors': ['M.

letter,Generation of intense continuum extreme-ultraviolet radiation by many-cycle laser fields,"<p>Continuing efforts in ultrashort pulse engineering have recently led to the breakthroughs of the generation of attosecond (10<sup>&#8722;18</sup>&#8201;s) pulse trains and isolated pulses. Although trains of multiple pulses can be generated through the interaction of many-optical-cycle pulses with gases&#8212;a process that has led to intense extreme-ultraviolet emission&#8212;the generation of isolated high-intensity pulses, which requires few-cycle driving pulses, remains a challenge. Here, we report a vital step towards the generation of such pulses, the production of broad continuum extreme-ultraviolet emission using a high-intensity, many-cycle, infrared pulsed laser, through the interferometric modulation of the ellipticity of 50-fs-long driving pulses. The increasing availability of high-power many-cycle lasers and their potential use in the construction of intense attosecond radiation&#8212;with either gas or solid-surface targets&#8212;offer exciting opportunities for multiphoton extreme-ultraviolet-pump&#8211;extreme-ultraviolet-probe studies of laser&#8211;matter and laser&#8211;plasma interactions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas, Institute of Electronic Structure & Laser, GR71110 Heraklion (Crete), PO Box 1527, Greece', 'authors': ['P.

letter,Collimation of sound assisted by acoustic surface waves,"<p>The discovery of the phenomenon of extraordinary optical transmission through a two-dimensional array of subwavelength holes in a metallic film has opened a new line of research within optics. The key role played by surface plasmons in transferring light efficiently from the input side of the metal film to the output region was soon realized. This fundamental knowledge enabled extension of this surface-plasmon ability to achieve extraordinary optical transmission and strong collimation of light in a single hole surrounded by a finite periodic array of indentations. Here, we show how these ideas developed for electromagnetic radiation can be transferred to other classical waves such as acoustic waves.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Departamento de Fisica Teorica de la Materia Condensada, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid 28049, Spain', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Surface heating of wire plasmas using laser-irradiated cone geometries,"<p>Petawatt lasers can generate extreme states of matter, making them unique tools for high-energy-density physics. Pressures in the gigabar regime can potentially be generated with cone-wire targets when the coupling efficiency is high and temperatures reach 2&#8211;4&#8201;keV (ref.&#160;). The only other method of obtaining such gigantic pressures is to use the megajoule laser facilities being constructed (National Ignition Facility and Laser M&#233;gaJoule). The energy can be transported over surprisingly long distances but, until now, the guiding mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we present the first definitive experimental proof that the heating is maximized close to the wire surface, by comparison of interferometric measurements with hydrodynamic simulations. New hybrid particle-in-cell simulations show the complex field structures for the first time, including a reversal of the magnetic field on the inside of the wire. This increases the return current in a spatially separated thin layer below the wire surface, resulting in the enhanced level of ohmic heating. There are a significant number of applications in high-energy-density science, ranging from equation-of-state studies to bright, hard X-ray sources, that will benefit from this new understanding of energy transport.</p>",,"[{'address': 'STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Chilton OX11 0QX, UK', 'authors': ['J.

letter,Dynamical synapses causing self-organized criticality in neural networks,"<p>Self-organized criticality is one of the key concepts to describe the emergence of complexity in natural systems. The concept asserts that a system self-organizes into a critical state where system observables are distributed according to a power law. Prominent examples of self-organized critical dynamics include piling of granular media, plate tectonics and stick&#8211;slip motion. Critical behaviour has been shown to bring about optimal computational capabilities, optimal transmission, storage of information and sensitivity to sensory stimuli. In neuronal systems, the existence of critical avalanches was predicted and later observed experimentally. However, whereas in the experiments generic critical avalanches were found, in the model of ref.&#160;they only show up if the set of parameters is fine-tuned externally to a critical transition state. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that by assuming (biologically more realistic) dynamical synapses in a spiking neural network, the neuronal avalanches turn from an exceptional phenomenon into a typical and robust self-organized critical behaviour, if the total resources of neurotransmitter are sufficiently large.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Göttingen, Bunsenstr. 10, 37073 Göttingen, Germany', 'authors': ['A.

article,Test of relativistic time dilation with fast optical atomic clocks at different velocities,"<p>Time dilation is one of the most fascinating aspects of special relativity as it abolishes the notion of absolute time. It was first observed experimentally by Ives and Stilwell in 1938 using the Doppler effect. Here we report on a method, based on fast optical atomic clocks with large, but different Lorentz boosts, that tests relativistic time dilation with unprecedented precision. The approach combines ion storage and cooling with optical frequency counting using a frequency comb. <sup>7</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> ions are prepared at 6.4% and 3.0% of the speed of light in a storage ring, and their time is read with an accuracy of 2&#215;10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> using laser saturation spectroscopy. The comparison of the Doppler shifts yields a time dilation measurement represented by a Mansouri&#8211;Sexl parameter , consistent with special relativity.

article,Quasiparticle interference and superconducting gap in Ca2−xNaxCuO2Cl2,"<p>High-transition-temperature (high-T<sub>c</sub>) superconductivity is ubiquitous in the cuprates containing CuO<sub>2</sub> planes, but each cuprate has its own character. The study of the material dependence of the d-wave superconducting gap (SG) should provide important insights into the mechanism of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity. However, because of the &#8216;pseudogap&#8217; phenomenon, it is often unclear whether the energy gaps observed by spectroscopic techniques really represent the SG. Here, we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to image nearly optimally doped Ca<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Na<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>(Na-CCOC) with T<sub>c</sub>=25&#8211;28&#8201;K. It enables us to observe the quasiparticle interference effect in this material, through which we obtain unambiguous information on the SG. Our analysis of quasiparticle interference in Na-CCOC reveals that the SG dispersion near the gap node is almost identical to that of Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>y</sub> (Bi2212) at the same doping level, despite the T<sub>c</sub> of Bi2212 being three times higher than that of Na-CCOC. We also find that the SG in Na-CCOC is confined in narrower energy and momentum ranges than Bi2212, which explains&#8212;at least in part&#8212;the remarkable material dependence of T<sub>c</sub>.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Magnetic Materials Laboratory, RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research), Wako 351-0198, Japan', 'authors': ['T.

article,Cross-sectional imaging of spin injection into a semiconductor,"<p>Recent discoveries of phenomena that relate electronic transport in solids to the spin angular momentum of the electrons are the fundamentals of spin electronics (spintronics). The first proposed conceptual spintronic device, the spin field-effect transistor&#8212;which has not yet been successfully implemented&#8212;requires the creation and detection of spin-polarized currents in a semiconductor. Whereas electrical spin injection from a ferromagnetic metal into GaAs has been achieved recently, the detection techniques used up to now have drawbacks like the requirement of large magnetic fields or limited information about the spin polarization in the semiconductor. Here we introduce a method that, by observation across a cleaved edge, enables us to directly visualize fully remanent electrical spin injection into bulk GaAs from a ferromagnetic contact, to image the spin-density distribution in the semiconductor in a cross-sectional view and to separate the effects of spin diffusion and electron drift.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut für Experimentelle und Angewandte Physik, Universität Regensburg, 93040 Regensburg, Germany', 'authors': ['P.

article,Coherent superposition of laser-driven soft-X-ray harmonics from successive sources,"<p>High-order harmonic generation from atoms ionized by femtosecond laser pulses has been a promising approach for the development of coherent short-wavelength sources. However, the realization of a powerful harmonic X-ray source has been hampered by a phase velocity mismatch between the driving wave and its harmonics, limiting their coherent build-up to a short propagation length and thereby compromising the efficiency of a single source. Here, we report coherent superposition of laser-driven soft-X-ray (SXR) harmonics, at wavelengths of 2&#8211;5&#8201;nm, generated in two successive sources by one and the same laser pulse. Observation of constructive and destructive interference suggests the feasibility of quasi-phase-matched SXR harmonic generation by a focused laser beam in a gas medium of modulated density. Our proof-of-concept study opens the prospect of enhancing the photon flux of SXR harmonic sources to levels enabling researchers to tackle a range of applications in physical as well as life sciences.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut für Photonik, Technische Universität Wien, A-1040 Wien, Austria', 'authors': ['J.

article,Optical antennas based on coupled nanoholes in thin metal films,"<p>The ability to control optical effects at the nanoscale is a challenge that could be of great importance for a range of photonic applications. However, progress requires a deep understanding of the relationship between near-field and far-field properties of the individual elements of the nanostructure, as well as of the role of nano-optical interactions. Here, we show that the strong interaction between nanoholes in optically thin metal films can be used to readily tune their spectral response and visibility. Control of this interaction in short chains of nanoholes enables either amplification or almost total suppression of the scattered light. The phenomena are interpreted in terms of hole coupling mediated via antisymmetric surface plasmon polaritons, which makes the nanohole chains effectively behave as linear wire antennas.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, SE-412 96 Göteborg, Sweden', 'authors': ['Y.

article,How pre-melting on surrounding interfaces broadens solid–liquid phase transitions,"<p>Phase transitions occur when the chemical potentials (including bulk and interfacial contributions) of two phases are equal. For systems with large interfaces, such as thin films or small particles, their interfacial properties strongly affect the phase behaviour. This dependence is important in fundamental and applied science (sintering, nucleation) but many details are still poorly understood owing to the scarcity of quantitative experimental data. Here, we use solid alkane domains that are one monolayer thick and deposited on a substrate to investigate and quantify the influence of the interface on the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition. The domains melt gradually below the bulk melting point of alkane. They coexist with a &#8216;pre-molten&#8217; liquid-like film of variable temperature-dependent thickness. Molecules interchange reversibly between film and domains, thereby converting transition enthalpy into interfacial energy. (Thus, we obtain details of the intermolecular interactions within the adjacent film.) We show that irrespective of its dimensionality or confinement, every solid will melt (partially) and spread out at temperatures below its bulk melting point if its liquid wets the adjoining interface.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Max-Planck-Institut fuer Kolloid- und Grenzflaechenforschung, Am Muehlenberg, D-14476 Potsdam/Golm, Germany', 'authors': ['Hans Riegler', '\xa0&\xa0Ralf Köhler']}]",False,"['Hans Riegler', 'Ralf Köhler']","Riegler, H., Köhler, R.
