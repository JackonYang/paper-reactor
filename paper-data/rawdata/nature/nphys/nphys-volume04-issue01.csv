letter,Observation of energetic electrons within magnetic islands,"<p>Magnetic reconnection is the underlying process that releases impulsively an enormous amount of magnetic energy in solar flares , flares on strongly magnetized neutron stars and substorms in the Earth&#8217;s magnetosphere. Studies of energy release during solar flares, in particular, indicate that up to 50% of the released energy is carried by accelerated 20&#8211;100&#8201;keV suprathermal electrons. How so many electrons can gain so much energy during reconnection has been a long-standing question. A recent theoretical study suggests that volume-filling contracting magnetic islands formed during reconnection can produce a large number of energetic electrons. Here we report the first evidence of the link between energetic electrons and magnetic islands during reconnection in the Earth&#8217;s magnetosphere. The results indicate that energetic electron fluxes peak at sites of compressed density within islands, which imposes a new constraint on theories of electron acceleration.</p>",[],True,"[""L.-J.

letter,Spectral weight transfer in the integer quantum Hall effect and its consequences,"<p>The energy spectrum of a two-dimensional electron gas placed in a transversal magnetic field B consists of quantized Landau levels. In the absence of disorder, the degeneracy of each Landau level is N=B A/&#966;<sub>0</sub>, where A is the area of the sample and &#966;<sub>0</sub>=h/e is the magnetic flux quantum. With disorder, localized states appear at the top and bottom of the broadened Landau level, whereas states in the centre of the Landau level (the critical region) remain delocalized. This single-electron theory adequately explains most aspects of the integer quantum Hall effect. One unnoticed issue is the location of the new states that appear in the Landau level with increasing B. Here, we show that they appear predominantly inside the critical region. This situation leads to a &#8216;spectral ordering&#8217; of the localized states, which explains the stripes observed in measurements of the local inverse compressibility, of two-terminal conductance and of Hall and longitudinal resistances without the need to invoke interactions as done in previous work.</p>",[],True,"[""Chenggang Zhou"", ""Mona Berciu""]","Zhou, C., Berciu, M.

letter,Algebraic charge liquids,"<p>High-temperature superconductivity emerges in the copper oxide compounds on changing the electron density of an insulator in which the electron spins are antiferromagnetically ordered. A key characteristic of the superconductor is that electrons can be extracted from it at zero energy only if their momenta take one of four specific values (the &#8216;nodal points&#8217;). A central enigma has been the evolution of those zero-energy electrons in the metallic state between the antiferromagnet and the superconductor, and recent experiments yield apparently contradictory results. The oscillation of the resistance in this metal as a function of magnetic field indicates that the zero-energy electrons carry momenta that lie on elliptical &#8216;Fermi pockets&#8217;, whereas ejection of electrons by high-intensity light indicates that the zero-energy electrons have momenta only along arc-like regions, or &#8216;Fermi arcs&#8217;. We present a theory of new states of matter, which we call &#8216;algebraic charge liquids&#8217;, and which arise naturally between the antiferromagnet and the superconductor, and reconcile these observations.

letter,Imaging spontaneous currents in superconducting arrays of π-junctions,"<p>A charge current can flow between two superconductors separated by a thin barrier. This phenomenon is the Josephson effect, which enables a current to tunnel at zero voltage, typically with no phase shift between the superconductors in the lowest-energy state. Recently, Josephson junctions with ground-state phase shifts of &#960;, proposed by theory three decades ago, have been demonstrated. In superconducting loops, &#960;-junctions cause spontaneous circulation of persistent currents in zero magnetic field, in analogy to spin-1/2 systems. Here we use a scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscope to image the spontaneous zero-field currents in superconducting networks of temperature-controlled &#960;-junctions with weakly ferromagnetic barriers.

letter,Quantitative measurement of voltage dependence of spin-transfer torque in MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions,"<p>When an electric current passes from one ferromagnetic layer via a non-magnetic layer into another ferromagnetic layer, the spin polarization and subsequent rotation of this current can induce a transfer of angular momentum that exerts a torque on the second ferromagnetic layer. This provides a potentially useful method to reverse and oscillate the magnetic momenta in nanoscale magnetic structures. Owing to the large current densities required to observe spin-torque-induced magnetization switching and microwave emission (&#8764;10<sup>7</sup>&#8201;A&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>), accurately measuring the strength, or even the direction, of the associated spin torque has proved difficult. Yet, such measurements are crucial to refining our understanding of the mechanisms responsible and the theories that describe them. To address this, we present quantitative experimental measurements of the spin torque in MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions for a wide range of bias currents covering the switching currents. The results verify the occurrence of two different spin-torque regimes with different bias dependences that agree well with theoretical predictions.</p>",[],True,"[""Hitoshi Kubota"", ""Akio Fukushima"", ""Kay Yakushiji"", ""Taro Nagahama"", ""Shinji Yuasa"", ""Koji Ando"", ""Hiroki Maehara"", ""Yoshinori Nagamine"", ""Koji Tsunekawa"", ""David D.

letter,Universal scaling between structural relaxation and vibrational dynamics in glass-forming liquids and polymers,"<p>If liquids, polymers, bio-materials, metals and molten salts can avoid crystallization during cooling or compression, they freeze into a microscopically disordered solid-like state, a glass. On approaching the glass transition, particles become trapped in transient cages&#8212;in which they rattle on picosecond timescales&#8212;formed by their nearest neighbours; the particles spend increasing amounts of time in their cages as the average escape time, or structural relaxation time &#964;<sub>&#945;</sub>, increases from a few picoseconds to thousands of seconds through the transition. Owing to the huge difference between relaxation and vibrational timescales, theoretical studies addressing the underlying rattling process have challenged our understanding of the structural relaxation. Numerical and experimental studies on liquids and glasses support the theories, but not without controversies (for a review see ref.&#160;). Here we show computer simulations that, when compared with experiments, reveal the universal correlation of the structural relaxation time (as well as the viscosity &#951;) and the rattling amplitude from glassy to low-viscosity states. According to the emerging picture the glass softens when the rattling amplitude exceeds a critical value, in agreement with the Lindemann criterion for the melting of crystalline solids and the free-volume model.</p>",[],True,"[""L.

letter,Relic topological defects from brane annihilation simulated in superfluid 3He,"<p>Although it is widely accepted that to resolve the &#8216;horizon&#8217; problem the early Universe must have undergone a sudden expansion (cosmic inflation), what mechanism drove this process is less clear. In the braneworld scenario, it is suggested that inflationary epochs may have been initiated and terminated by brane collisions and annihilations. Branes are objects of lower dimensionality embedded in a higher-dimensional matrix. For example, we may live on a three-dimensional brane embedded in a four-dimensional matrix. However, such structures are so far removed from everyday reality that bringing physical insight to bear is difficult. Here we report laboratory experiments where we simulate brane annihilation using the closest brane analogue to which we have access, the coherent phase boundary between the two phases of superfluid <sup>3</sup>He. When two branes collide or annihilate, topological defects may be created, whose influence may still be detectable today. By creating a brane&#8211;antibrane pair in superfluid <sup>3</sup>He and subsequently annihilating it, we can detect that defects are indeed created in the superfluid texture (the superfluid analogue of spacetime), thus confirming that the concept of defect formation after brane annihilation in the early Universe can be reproduced in analogous systems in the&#160;laboratory.</p>",[],True,"[""D.

article,Quantum non-demolition detection of strongly correlated systems,"<p>Preparation, manipulation and detection of strongly correlated states of quantum many-body systems are among the most important goals and challenges of modern physics. Ultracold atoms offer an unprecedented playground for the realization of these goals. Here, we propose a method for detecting strongly correlated states of ultracold atoms in a quantum non-demolition scheme, that is, in the fundamentally least destructive way permitted by quantum mechanics. In our method, spatially resolved components of atomic spins couple to quantum polarization degrees of freedom of light. In this way, quantum correlations of matter are faithfully mapped on those of light; the latter can then be efficiently measured using homodyne detection. We illustrate the power of such spatially resolved quantum-noise-limited polarization measurement by applying this method to the detection of various standard and &#8216;exotic&#8217; types of antiferromagnetic order in lattice systems, and by indicating the feasibility of detection of superfluid order in Fermi liquids.</p>",[],False,"[""Kai Eckert"", ""Oriol Romero-Isart"", ""Mirta Rodriguez"", ""Maciej Lewenstein"", ""Eugene S.

The metallic behaviour is only observed in low-disorder systems, where interactions between the carriers are strong. However, the strength of the metallic behaviour is not universal, with decreases in resistivity ranging from a few per cent to an order of magnitude as T&#8594;0. Here, we compare the metallic behaviour in 2D systems dominated by long- and short-range disorder. We thereby highlight the pivotal role played by the type of disorder in determining the strength of metallic behaviour in these systems. In doing so, we resolve recent confusion in the literature that has arisen from the application of interaction-based theories of metallic behaviour to 2D systems whose disorder environments are inconsistent with the assumptions made by these theories.</p>",[],False,"[""W.

article,Efficient coupling of photons to a single molecule and the observation of its resonance fluorescence,"<p>Single dye molecules at cryogenic temperatures exhibit many spectroscopic phenomena known from the study of free atoms and are thus promising candidates for experiments in fundamental quantum optics. However, the existing techniques for their detection have either sacrificed information on the coherence of the excited state or have been inefficient. Here, we show that these problems can be addressed by focusing the excitation light near to the extinction cross-section of a molecule. Our detection scheme enables us to explore resonance fluorescence over nine orders of magnitude of excitation intensity and to separate its coherent and incoherent parts. In the strong excitation regime, we demonstrate the first direct observation of the Mollow fluorescence triplet from a single solid-state emitter. Under weak excitation, we report the detection of a single molecule with an incident power as faint as 600&#8201;aW, paving the way for studying nonlinear effects with only a few photons.</p>",[],False,"[""G.
