letter,Evolution equation for quantum entanglement,"<p>Quantum information technology largely relies on a precious and fragile resource, quantum entanglement, a highly non-trivial manifestation of the coherent superposition of states of composite quantum systems. However, our knowledge of the time evolution of this resource under realistic conditions&#8212;that is, when corrupted by environment-induced decoherence&#8212;is so far limited, and general statements on entanglement dynamics in open systems are scarce. Here we prove a simple and general factorization law for quantum systems shared by two parties, which describes the time evolution of entanglement on passage of either component through an arbitrary noisy channel. The robustness of entanglement-based quantum information processing protocols is thus easily and fully characterized by a single quantity.</p>",[],True,"[""Thomas Konrad"", ""Fernando de Melo"", ""Markus Tiersch"", ""Christian Kasztelan"", ""Adriano Arag\u00e3o"", ""Andreas Buchleitner""]","Konrad, T., de Melo, F., Tiersch, M. et al.

letter,Memory-built-in quantum teleportation with photonic and atomic qubits,"<p>The combination of quantum teleportation and quantum memory of photonic qubits is essential for future implementations of large-scale quantum communication and measurement-based quantum computation. Both steps have been achieved separately in many proof-of-principle experiments, but the demonstration of memory-built-in teleportation of photonic qubits remains an experimental challenge. Here, we demonstrate teleportation between photonic (flying) and atomic (stationary) qubits. In our experiment, an unknown polarization state of a single photon is teleported over 7&#8201;m onto a remote atomic qubit that also serves as a quantum memory. The teleported state can be stored and successfully read out for up to 8&#8201;&#956;s. Besides being of fundamental interest, teleportation between photonic and atomic qubits with the direct inclusion of a readable quantum memory represents a step towards an efficient and scalable quantum network.</p>",[],True,"[""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Shuai Chen"", ""Zhen-Sheng Yuan"", ""Bo Zhao"", ""Chih-Sung Chuu"", ""J\u00f6rg Schmiedmayer"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Chen, YA., Chen, S., Yuan, ZS. et al.

letter,"Visualization of the interplay between high-temperature superconductivity, the pseudogap and impurity resonances","<p>In conventional superconductors, the superconducting gap in the electronic excitation spectrum prevents scattering of low-energy electrons. In high-temperature superconductors (HTSs), an extra gap, the pseudogap, develops well above the superconducting transition temperature T<sub>C</sub>. Here, we present a new avenue of investigating the pseudogap state, using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) of resonances generated by single-atom scatterers. Previous studies on the superconducting state of HTSs have led to a fairly consistent picture in which potential scatterers, such as Zn, strongly suppress superconductivity in an atomic-scale region, while generating low-energy excitations with a spatial distribution&#8212;as imaged by STM&#8212;indicative of the d-wave nature of the superconducting gap. Surprisingly, we find that similar native impurity resonances coexist spatially with the superconducting gap at low temperatures and survive virtually unchanged on warming through T<sub>C</sub>. These findings demonstrate that properties of impurity resonances in HTSs are not determined by the nature of the superconducting state, as previously suggested, but instead provide new insights into the pseudogap state.</p>",[],True,"[""Kamalesh Chatterjee"", ""M.

letter,Magnetic flux periodicity of h/e in superconducting loops,"<p>Superconducting loops exhibit macroscopic quantum phenomena that have far-reaching implications; magnetic flux periodicity and flux quantization are the key to our understanding of fundamental properties of superconductors and are the basis for many applications. In superconducting rings, the electrical current responds to a magnetic flux by having a periodicity of h/2e, where the ratio of Planck&#8217;s constant and the elementary charge defines the magnetic flux quantum h/e. The well-known h/2e periodicity is a hallmark for electronic pairing in superconductors and is considered evidence for the existence of Cooper pairs. Here, we show that in contrast to this long-held belief, rings of many superconductors bear an h/e periodicity. These superconductors include the high-temperature superconductors, Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>, the heavy-fermion superconductors, as well as all other unconventional superconductors with nodes (zeros) in the energy gap, and conventional s-wave superconductors with small gaps. As we show, the 50-year-old Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer theory of superconductivity implies that for loops of such superconductors the ground-state energies and consequently also the supercurrents are generically h/e periodic.</p>",[],True,"[""F.

letter,Charge fractionalization in quantum wires,"<p>Although the unit of charge in nature is a fundamental constant, the charge of individual quasiparticles in some low-dimensional systems may be fractionalized. Quantum one-dimensional (1D) systems, for instance, are theoretically predicted to carry charge in units smaller than the electron charge e. Unlike 2D systems, the charge of these excitations is not quantized and depends directly on the strength of the Coulomb interactions. For example, in a 1D system with momentum conservation, it is predicted that the charge of a unidirectional electron that is injected into the wire decomposes into right-&#160;and left-moving charge excitations carrying fractional charges f<sub>0</sub>e and (1&#8722;f<sub>0</sub>)e respectively. f<sub>0</sub> approaches unity for non-interacting electrons and is less than one for repulsive interactions. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for charge fractionalization in one dimension. Unidirectional electrons are injected at the bulk of a wire and the imbalance in the currents detected at two drains on opposite sides of the injection region is used to determine f<sub>0</sub>. Our results elucidate further the collective nature of electrons in one dimension.</p>",[],True,"[""Hadar Steinberg"", ""Gilad Barak"", ""Amir Yacoby"", ""Loren N. Pfeiffer"", ""Ken W.

letter,Hybrid single-electron transistor as a source of quantized electric current,"<p>The basis of synchronous manipulation of individual electrons in solid-state devices was laid by the rise of single electronics about two decades ago. Ultrasmall structures in a low-temperature environment form an ideal domain for addressing electrons one by one. In the so-called metrological triangle, voltage from the Josephson effect and resistance from the quantum Hall effect would be tested against current via Ohm&#8217;s law for a consistency check of the fundamental constants of nature, &#8463; and e (ref.&#160;). Several attempts to create a metrological current source that would comply with the demanding criteria of extreme accuracy, high yield and implementation with not too many control parameters have been reported.

letter,Noise autocorrelation spectroscopy with coherent Raman scattering,"<p>Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) with femtosecond laser pulses has become a widespread method in nonlinear optical spectroscopy and microscopy. As a third-order nonlinear process, femtosecond CARS exhibits high efficiency at low average laser power. High sensitivity to molecular structure enables detection of small quantities of complex molecules and non-invasive biological imaging. Temporal and spectral resolution of CARS is typically limited by the duration of the excitation pulses and their frequency bandwidth, respectively. Broadband femtosecond pulses are advantageous for time-resolved CARS spectroscopy, but offer poor spectral resolution. The latter can be improved by invoking optical or quantum interference at the expense of increasing complexity of instrumentation and susceptibility to noise. Here, we present a new approach to coherent Raman spectroscopy in which high resolution is achieved by means of deliberately introduced noise. The proposed method combines the efficiency of a coherent process with the robustness of incoherent light. It does require averaging over different noise realizations, but no temporal scanning or spectral pulse shaping as commonly used by frequency-resolved spectroscopic methods with ultrashort&#160;pulses.</p>",[],True,"[""Xiaoji G.

letter,A compact synchrotron radiation source driven by a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator,"<p>Ultrashort light pulses are powerful tools for time-resolved studies of molecular and atomic dynamics. They arise in the visible and infrared range from femtosecond lasers, and at shorter wavelengths, in the ultraviolet and X-ray range, from synchrotron sources and free-electron lasers. Recent progress in laser wakefield accelerators has resulted in electron beams with energies from tens of mega-electron volts (refs&#160;) to more than 1&#8201;GeV within a few centimetres, with pulse durations predicted to be several femtoseconds. The enormous progress in improving beam quality and stability makes them serious candidates for driving the next generation of ultracompact light sources. Here, we demonstrate the first successful combination of a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator, producing 55&#8211;75&#8201;MeV electron bunches, with an undulator to generate visible synchrotron radiation.

letter,Enhanced reaction kinetics in biological cells,"<p>The cell cytoskeleton is a striking example of an &#8216;active&#8217; medium driven out-of-equilibrium by ATP hydrolysis. Such activity has been shown to have a spectacular impact on the mechanical and rheological properties of the cellular medium, as well as on its transport properties: a generic tracer particle freely diffuses as in a standard equilibrium medium, but also intermittently binds with random interaction times to motor proteins, which perform active ballistic excursions along cytoskeletal filaments. Here, we propose an analytical model of transport-limited reactions in active media, and show quantitatively how active transport can enhance reactivity for large enough tracers such as vesicles. We derive analytically the average interaction time with motor proteins that optimizes the reaction rate, and reveal remarkable universal features of the optimal configuration. We discuss why active transport may be beneficial in various biological examples: cell cytoskeleton, membranes and lamellipodia, and tubular structures such as&#160;axons.</p>",[],True,"[""C.

article,Triplet supercurrents in clean and disordered half-metallic ferromagnets,"<p>Interfaces between materials with differently ordered phases present unique opportunities to study fundamental problems in physics. One example is the interface between a singlet superconductor and a half-metallic ferromagnet, where Cooper pairing occurs between electrons with opposite spin on the superconducting side, whereas the other exhibits 100% spin polarization. The recent surprising observation of a supercurrent through half-metallic CrO<sub>2</sub> therefore requires a mechanism for conversion between unpolarized and completely spin-polarized supercurrents. Here, we suggest a conversion mechanism based on electron spin precession together with triplet-pair rotation at interfaces with broken spin-rotation symmetry. In the diffusive limit (short mean free path), the triplet supercurrent is dominated by inter-related odd-frequency s-wave and even-frequency p-wave pairs. In the crossover to the ballistic limit, further symmetry components become relevant. The interface region exhibits a superconducting state of mixed-spin pairs with highly unusual symmetry properties that open up new perspectives for exotic Josephson devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Matthias Eschrig"", ""Tomas L\u00f6fwander""]","Eschrig, M., Löfwander, T.

article,Observation of electron–hole puddles in graphene using a scanning single-electron transistor,"<p>The electronic structure of graphene causes its charge carriers to behave like relativistic particles. For a perfect graphene sheet free from impurities and disorder, the Fermi energy lies at the so-called &#8216;Dirac point&#8217;, where the density of electronic states vanishes. But in the inevitable presence of disorder, theory predicts that equally probable regions of electron-rich and hole-rich puddles will arise. These puddles could explain graphene&#8217;s anomalous non-zero minimal conductivity at zero average carrier density. Here, we use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the local density of states and the carrier density landscape in the vicinity of the neutrality point. Our results confirm the existence of electron&#8211;hole puddles, and rule out extrinsic substrate effects as explanations for their emergence and topology.

article,Electrohydrodynamic tip streaming and emission of charged drops from liquid cones,"<p>When a liquid is subject to a sufficiently strong electric field, it can be induced to emit thin fluid jets from conical tip structures that form at its surface. Such behaviour has both fundamental and practical implications, from raindrops in thunderclouds to pendant drops in electrospray mass spectrometry. But the large difference in length scales between these microscopic/nanoscopic jets and the macroscopic drops and films from which they emerge has made it difficult to model the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) processes that govern such phenomena. Here, we report simulations and experiments that enable a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms of cone formation, jet emission and break-up that occur during EHD tip streaming from a liquid film of finite conductivity. Simulations show that EHD tip streaming does not occur if the liquid is perfectly conducting or perfectly insulating, and enable us to develop a scaling law to predict the size of the drops produced from jet break-up.</p>",[],False,"[""Robert T.
