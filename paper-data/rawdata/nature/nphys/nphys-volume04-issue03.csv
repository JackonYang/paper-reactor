The insights and methods also transfer to novel superconducting and metallic states. Of particular interest are critical quantum states, sometimes found at quantum phase transitions, which have gapless excitations with no particle- or wave-like interpretation, and control a significant portion of the finite-temperature phase diagram.

review article,Quantum criticality in heavy-fermion metals,"<p>Quantum criticality describes the collective fluctuations of matter undergoing a second-order phase transition at zero temperature. Heavy-fermion metals have in recent years emerged as prototypical systems to study quantum critical points. There have been considerable efforts, both experimental and theoretical, that use these magnetic systems to address problems that are central to the broad understanding of strongly correlated quantum matter. Here, we summarize some of the basic issues, including the extent to which the quantum criticality in heavy-fermion metals goes beyond the standard theory of order-parameter fluctuations, the nature of the Kondo effect in the quantum-critical regime, the non-Fermi-liquid phenomena that accompany quantum criticality and the interplay between quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Philipp Gegenwart"", ""Qimiao Si"", ""Frank Steglich""]","Gegenwart, P., Si, Q. & Steglich, F.

review article,Bose–Einstein condensation in magnetic insulators,"<p>The Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate (BEC) is a fascinating state of matter predicted to occur for particles obeying Bose statistics. Although the BEC has been observed with bosonic atoms in liquid helium and cold gases, the concept is much more general. We here review analogous states, where excitations in magnetic insulators form the BEC. In antiferromagnets, elementary excitations are magnons, quasiparticles with integer spin and Bose statistics. In certain experiments their density can be controlled by an applied magnetic field leading to the formation of a BEC. Furthermore, interactions between the excitations and the interplay with the crystalline lattice produce very rich physics compared with the canonical BEC. Studies of magnon condensation in a growing number of magnetic materials thus provide a unique window into an exciting world of quantum phase transitions and exotic quantum states, with striking parallels to phenomena studied in ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices.</p>",[],False,"[""Thierry Giamarchi"", ""Christian R\u00fcegg"", ""Oleg Tchernyshyov""]","Giamarchi, T., Rüegg, C. & Tchernyshyov, O.

letter,Quantum mechanical complementarity probed in a closed-loop Aharonov–Bohm interferometer,"<p>The complementarity principle demands that a particle reveals wave-like properties only when the different paths that it can take are indistinguishable. The complementarity has been demonstrated in optics with pairs of correlated photons and in two-path solid-state interferometers with phase-coherent electrons. In the latter experiment, a charge detector embedded near one path of a two-path electron interferometer provided which-path information. Here, we report on electron dephasing in an Aharonov&#8211;Bohm ring interferometer via a charge detector adjacent to the ring. In contrast to the two-path interferometer, charge detection in the ring does not always provide path information. The interference was suppressed only when path information could be acquired, even if only in principle. This&#160;confirms that dephasing is not always induced by &#8216;disturbing&#8217;&#160;the interfering particle through the interferometer&#8211;environment interactions: path information of the particle must be available too. Our experiment suggests that acquisition of which-path information is more fundamental than the back-action in understanding quantum mechanical complementarity.</p>",[],True,"[""Dong-In Chang"", ""Gyong Luck Khym"", ""Kicheon Kang"", ""Yunchul Chung"", ""Hu-Jong Lee"", ""Minky Seo"", ""Moty Heiblum"", ""Diana Mahalu"", ""Vladimir Umansky""]","Chang, DI., Khym, G., Kang, K. et al.

letter,Accurate theoretical fits to laser-excited photoemission spectra in the normal phase of high-temperature superconductors,"<p>It has long been believed that the &#8216;normal&#8217; (non-superconducting) state of the high-transition-temperature superconductors is anything but normal. In particular, this state, which exists above the superconducting transition temperature T<sub>c</sub>, has very unusual transport properties and electron spectral functions, presenting a more difficult, complex and important problem than the superconductivity itself. The origin of this difficulty and complexity resides in the strong electronic correlations, or the many-body Coulomb interactions between electrons, which cannot be properly treated within the standard theories of the electronic structure of solids. A new treatment of these interactions, on the basis of a Gutzwiller projection&#8212;which gives zero quasiparticle weight at the Fermi surface and removes the possibility for double electron occupancy on any one site&#8212;has recently been proposed, but fits to available data were unsatisfactory. Here, we compare the electron spectral functions computed within this theoretical treatment with bulk-sensitive measurements made by low-energy photons, using laser-excited angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the superconductor Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+&#948;</sub> (refs&#160;). The theory captures the asymmetrical shape of the experimental curves with good accuracy and in principle has only one free parameter. Moreover, no background subtraction is necessary.</p>",[],True,"[""Philip A. Casey"", ""J. D. Koralek"", ""N. C. Plumb"", ""D. S. Dessau"", ""Philip W.

letter,Cruising through molecular bound-state manifolds with radiofrequency,"<p>The production of ultracold molecules with their rich internal structure is currently attracting considerable interest. For future experiments, it will be important to efficiently transfer these molecules from their initial internal quantum state at production to other quantum states of interest. Transfer tools such as optical Raman schemes, radiofrequency transitions (see, for example, ref.&#160;) or magnetic field ramping exist, but are either technically involved or limited in their applicability. Here, we demonstrate a simple, highly efficient hybrid transfer method that overcomes a number of the previous limitations. The scheme is based on magnetically tuned mixing of two neighbouring molecular levels, which enables otherwise forbidden radiofrequency transitions between them. By repeating this process at various magnetic fields, molecules can be successively transported through a large manifold of quantum states. Applying nine transfers, we convert very weakly bound Feshbach molecules to a much more deeply bound level with a binding energy corresponding to 3.6&#8201;GHz. As an important spin-off of our experiments, we demonstrate a high-precision spectroscopy method for investigating level crossings.</p>",[],True,"[""F. Lang"", ""P. v. d. Straten"", ""B.

letter,Scanning-probe spectroscopy of semiconductor donor molecules,"<p>Semiconductor devices continue to press into the nanoscale regime, and new applications have been proposed for which a single dopant atom acts as the functional part of the device. Moreover, because shallow donors and acceptors are analogous to hydrogen atoms, experiments on small numbers of dopants have the potential to be a testing ground for fundamental questions of atomic and molecular physics. Although dopant properties are well understood with respect to the bulk, the study of configurations of dopants in small numbers is an emerging field. Here we present local capacitance measurements of electrons entering silicon donors in a gallium arsenide heterostructure. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first example of single-electron capacitance spectroscopy carried out directly with a scanning probe tip. The precise position with respect to tip voltage of the observed single-electron peaks varies with the location of the probe, reflecting a random distribution of silicon within the donor plane. In addition, three broad capacitance peaks are observed independent of the probe location, indicating clusters of electrons entering the system at approximately the same voltages. These broad peaks are consistent with the addition energy spectrum of donor molecules, effectively formed by nearest-neighbour pairs of silicon donors.</p>",[],True,"[""I. Kuljanishvili"", ""C.

letter,Towards the zero-surface-tension limit in granular fingering instability,"<p>The finger-like branching pattern that occurs when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one confined between two parallel plates has been widely studied as a classical example of a mathematically tractable hydrodynamic instability. Fingering in such Hele&#8211;Shaw geometries has been generated not only with newtonian fluids but also with various non-newtonian fluids including fine granular material displaced by gas, liquid or larger grains. Here, we study a granular Hele&#8211;Shaw system to explore the zero-surface-tension property of granular &#8216;fluids&#8217;. We demonstrate that the grain&#8211;gas interface exhibits fractal structure and sharp cusps, which are associated with the hitherto-unrealizable singular hydrodynamics predicted in the zero-surface-tension limit of normal fluid fingering. Above the yield stress, the scaling for the finger width is distinct from that for ordinary fluids, reflecting unique granular properties such as friction-induced dissipation as opposed to viscous damping. Despite such differences, the dimension of the global fractal structure and the shape of the singular cusps on the interface agree with the theories based on simple laplacian growth of conventional fluid fingering in the zero-surface-tension limit.</p>",[],True,"[""Xiang Cheng"", ""Lei Xu"", ""Aaron Patterson"", ""Heinrich M.

article,X-ray-scattering information obtained from near-field speckle,"<p>Whenever coherent radiation impinges on a scattering object, a speckled intensity pattern is produced. In the far field the speckle size and shape do not mirror any properties of the object. Here we show that, in spite of the limited spatial coherence of synchrotron radiation, speckles with remarkable properties can be observed when the sensor is placed in the near field. The statistical analysis of these speckles generates static and dynamic X-ray-scattering data, and the results from two typical scattering samples are given. When compared with conventional far-field techniques, the method enables a substantial increase of around four orders of magnitude in the beam size and power and opens the way to a previously inaccessible region of scattering angles. It also offers the possibility of tracking the spatio-temporal evolution of complex fluids and other inhomogeneous systems.</p>",[],False,"[""R. Cerbino"", ""L. Peverini"", ""M. A. C. Potenza"", ""A.

article,Coarsening of granular segregation patterns in quasi-two-dimensional tumblers,"<p>A fundamental characteristic of granular flows is segregation on the basis of particle size or density. For bidisperse mixtures of particles, revolutions of the order of 10 produce a segregation pattern of several radial streaks in quasi-two-dimensional rotating tumblers with fill fractions between 50% and 70%. By extending the duration of the experiments to the order of 10<sup>2</sup>&#8211;10<sup>3</sup> tumbler revolutions, we have found the first evidence of coarsening of the radial streak pattern to as few as one streak, resulting in an unexpected wedge-shaped segregation pattern. This phenomenon occurs for a wide range of conditions including several fill fractions, particle sizes and mixtures of particles varying in both size and density in circular tumblers as well as for particles varying in size in square tumblers. Coarsening seems to be driven by transport of small (or dense) particles from streak to streak through the semicircular radial core, leading to new questions about the physics of coarsening of granular segregation patterns.</p>",[],False,"[""Steven W.

article,Liquid–solid-like transition in quasi-one-dimensional driven granular media,"<p>The theory of non-ideal gases at thermodynamic equilibrium, for instance the van der Waals gas model, has played a central role in our understanding of coexisting phases, as well as the transitions between them. In contrast, the theory fails with granular matter because collisions between the grains dissipate energy, and their macroscopic size renders thermal fluctuations negligible. When a mass of grains is subjected to mechanical vibration, it can make a transition to a fluid state. In this state, granular matter exhibits patterns and instabilities that resemble those of molecular fluids. Here, we report a granular solid&#8211;liquid phase transition in a vibrating granular monolayer. Unexpectedly, the transition is mediated by waves and is triggered by a negative compressibility, as for van der Waals phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. The dynamic behaviour that we observe&#8212;coalescence, coagulation and wave propagation&#8212;is common to a wide class of phase transitions.
