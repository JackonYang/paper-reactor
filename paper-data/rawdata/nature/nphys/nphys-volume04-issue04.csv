letter,Ultrafast X-ray study of dense-liquid-jet flow dynamics using structure-tracking velocimetry,"<p>High-speed liquid jets and sprays are complex multiphase flow phenomena with many important industrial applications. Great efforts have been devoted to understand their dynamics since the pioneering work of Rayleigh on low-speed jets. Attempts to use conventional laser optical techniques to provide information about the internal structure of high-speed jets have been unsuccessful owing to the multiple scattering by droplets and interfaces, and the high density of the jet near the nozzle exit. Focused-X-ray-beam absorption measurements could provide only average quantitative density distributions using repeated imaging. Here, we report a novel approach on the basis of ultrafast synchrotron-X-ray full-field phase-contrast imaging. As illustrated in our case study, this technique reveals, for the first time, instantaneous velocity and internal structure of optically dense sprays with a combined unprecedented spatial and time resolution. This technique has tremendous potential for the study of transient phenomenon dynamics.</p>",[],True,"[""Yujie Wang"", ""Xin Liu"", ""Kyoung-Su Im"", ""Wah-Keat Lee"", ""Jin Wang"", ""Kamel Fezzaa"", ""David L.

article,The one-dimensional Wigner crystal in carbon nanotubes,"<p>A dilute system of electrons interacting through long-range Coulomb forces has been predicted to form a periodic solid known as a Wigner crystal. To date, this state has been observed directly only in two-dimensional systems. Here, using low-temperature single-electron transport spectroscopy, we show that the hole gas in low-disorder semiconducting carbon nanotubes forms a one-dimensional Wigner crystal. In an axial magnetic field, we observe three distinct regimes of spin and isospin polarization as carrier density is varied. We explain these regimes in terms of a Wigner crystal picture based on a gapped Luttinger liquid model, with the carriers represented by spatially localized solitons. Our observations could enable greater control over the behaviour of the spatially separated system of carriers. Such control, combined with the inherently long coherence times of carriers in carbon nanotubes, could prove useful in the development of solid-state quantum computing.</p>",[],False,"[""Vikram V.

article,Evolution of the electronic excitation spectrum with strongly diminishing hole density in superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ,"<p>Coulomb interactions between the carriers may provide the mechanism for enhanced unconventional superconductivity in the copper oxides. However, they simultaneously cause inelastic quasiparticle scattering that can destroy it. Understanding the evolution of this balance with doping is crucial because it is responsible for the rapidly diminishing critical temperature as the hole density p is reduced towards the Mott insulating state. Here, we use tunnelling spectroscopy to measure the T&#8594;0 spectrum of electronic excitations N(E) over a wide range of hole density p in superconducting Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+&#948;</sub>. We introduce a parameterization for N(E) based on a particle&#8211;hole symmetric anisotropic energy gap &#916;(k)=&#916;<sub>1</sub>(cos(k<sub>x</sub>)&#8722;cos(k<sub>y</sub>))/2 plus an inelastic scattering rate that varies linearly with energy &#915;<sub>2</sub>(E)=&#945; E. We demonstrate that this form of N(E) enables successful fitting of differential tunnelling conductance spectra throughout much of the Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+&#948;</sub> phase diagram. We find that &#916;<sub>1</sub> values rise with falling p along the familiar trajectory of excitations to the &#8216;pseudogap&#8217; energy, whereas the energy-dependent inelastic scattering rate &#915;<sub>2</sub>(E)=&#945; E seems to be an intrinsic property of the electronic structure and rises steeply for p&lt;16%. Such diverging inelastic scattering may play a key role in suppression of superconductivity in the copper oxides as the Mott insulating state is approached.</p>",[],False,"[""J. W.

article,Suprafroth in type-I superconductors,"<p>The structure and dynamics of froths have been subjects of intense interest owing to the desire to understand the behaviour of complex systems where topological intricacy prohibits exact evaluation of the ground state. The dynamics of a traditional froth involves drainage and drying at the cell boundaries; thus, it is irreversible. Here, we report a new member of the froth family: suprafroth, in which the cell boundaries are superconducting and the cell interior is normal, or non-superconducting. Despite having a very different microscopic origin, topological analysis of the structure of the suprafroth shows that the same statistical laws, such as those of von Neumann and of Lewis apply to a suprafroth. Furthermore, for the first time in the analysis of froths, there is a global measurable property, the magnetic moment, which can be directly related to the suprafroth structure. We propose that this suprafroth is a model system for the analysis of the complex physics of two-dimensional froths&#8212;with magnetic field and temperature as external (reversible) control parameters.</p>",[],False,"[""Ruslan Prozorov"", ""Andrew F.
