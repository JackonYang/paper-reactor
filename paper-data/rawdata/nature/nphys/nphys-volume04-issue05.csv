review article,The physics and applications of random lasers,"<p>Recent developments in the field of micro and nanophotonics have shown that it is possible to make use of the intrinsic disorder in photonic materials to create useful optical structures. An example is that of a random laser, in which laser action is obtained in disordered structures such as powders and porous glasses. Although these materials are easy to fabricate, it is only recently that researchers have started to fully understand the rich and complex physical processes that take place in amplifying disordered systems. Here, I will give an overview of the various recent results and discuss the physical picture that has now emerged. I will also discuss possible applications of this new type of disorder-based laser light source.</p>",[],False,"[""Diederik S. Wiersma""]","Wiersma, D. The physics and applications of random lasers.

article,d-wave duality and its reflections in high-temperature superconductors,"<p>The Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer theory describes the formation of electron pairs, or Cooper pairs, and their instant condensation into a superconducting state. Helium atoms are &#8216;preformed&#8217; bosons and, in addition to their superfluid state, can also form a quantum solid that lacks phase coherence. Here I show that the fate of Cooper pairs can be more varied than the Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer or helium paradigms. In copper oxide d-wave superconductors, Cooper pairs are non-local objects, with both centre-of-mass and relative motions. As the level of doping of charge carriers decreases, the centre-of-mass fluctuations force a correlated d-wave superconductor into a state with enhanced diamagnetism and robust but short-ranged superconducting order. At extreme underdoping, the relative fluctuations take over and two pseudogaps&#8212;&#8216;small&#8217; (charge) and &#8216;large&#8217; (spin)&#8212;emerge naturally, as Cooper pairs &#8216;disintegrate&#8217; and charge detaches from spin-singlet bonds. The ensuing ground state(s) are governed by antiferromagnetic rather than by superconducting correlations.</p>",[],False,"[""Zlatko Te\u0161anovi\u0107""]","Tešanović, Z.d-wave duality and its reflections in high-temperature superconductors.

article,Resolved-sideband cooling of a micromechanical oscillator,"<p>In atomic laser cooling, preparation of the motional quantum ground state has been achieved using resolved-sideband cooling of trapped ions. Here, we report the first demonstration of resolved-sideband cooling of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator, a key step towards ground-state cooling as quantum back-action is sufficiently suppressed in this scheme. A laser drives the first lower sideband of an optical microcavity resonance, the decay rate of which is twenty times smaller than the eigenfrequency of the associated mechanical oscillator. Cooling rates above 1.5&#8201;MHz are attained, three orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic dissipation rate of the mechanical device that is independently monitored at the  level. Direct spectroscopy of the motional sidebands of the cooling laser confirms the expected suppression of motional increasing processes during cooling. Moreover, using two-mode pumping, this regime could enable motion measurement beyond the standard quantum limit and the concomitant generation of non-classical states of motion.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Random organization in periodically driven systems,"<p>Understanding self-organization is one of the key tasks for controlling and manipulating the structure of materials at the micro- and nanoscale. In general, self-organization is driven by interparticle potentials and is opposed by the chaotic dynamics characteristic of many driven non-equilibrium systems. Here we introduce a new model that shows how the irreversible collisions that generally produce diffusive chaotic dynamics can also cause a system to self-organize to avoid future collisions. This can lead to a self-organized non-fluctuating quiescent state, with a dynamical phase transition separating it from fluctuating diffusing states. We apply the model to recent experiments on periodically sheared particle suspensions where a transition from reversible to irreversible behaviour was observed. New experiments presented here exhibit remarkable agreement with this simple model. More generally, the model and experiments provide new insights into how driven systems can self-organize.</p>",[],False,"[""Laurent Cort\u00e9"", ""P. M. Chaikin"", ""J. P. Gollub"", ""D. J.
