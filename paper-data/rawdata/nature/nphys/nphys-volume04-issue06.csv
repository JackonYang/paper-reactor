review article,Principles and applications of compact laser–plasma accelerators,"<p>Rapid progress in the development of high-intensity laser systems has extended our ability to study light&#8211;matter interactions far into the relativistic domain, in which electrons are driven to velocities close to the speed of light. As well as being of fundamental interest in their own right, these interactions enable the generation of high-energy particle beams that are short, bright and have good spatial quality. Along with steady improvements in the size, cost and repetition rate of high-intensity lasers, the unique characteristics of laser-driven particle beams are expected to be useful for a wide range of contexts, including proton therapy for the treatment of cancers, materials characterization, radiation-driven chemistry, border security through the detection of explosives, narcotics and other dangerous substances, and of course high-energy particle physics. Here, we review progress that has been made towards realizing such possibilities and the principles that underlie them.</p>",[],False,"[""Victor Malka"", ""J\u00e9r\u00f4me Faure"", ""Yann A.

article,Breakdown of the adiabatic limit in low-dimensional gapless systems,"<p>It is generally believed that a generic system can be reversibly transformed from one state to another by a sufficiently slow change of parameters. Microscopically, this belief is often justified using connections to the quantum adiabatic theorem stating that there are no transitions between different energy levels if the hamiltonian changes slowly in time. Here, we show that in fact the response to such a slow change can be non-trivial in low-dimensional gapless systems. We identify three generic regimes of the response: analytic, non-analytic and non-adiabatic, which are characterized by a different behaviour of the heating induced in the system with the ramp rate. In the last regime, the limits of the ramp rate going to zero and the system size going to infinity do not commute and the adiabatic process does not exist in the thermodynamic limit. We support our results with numerical and analytical calculations.</p>",[],False,"[""Anatoli Polkovnikov"", ""Vladimir Gritsev""]","Polkovnikov, A., Gritsev, V.

article,Anyonic interferometry and protected memories in atomic spin lattices,"<p>Strongly correlated quantum systems can exhibit exotic behaviour called topological order which is characterized by non-local correlations that depend on the system topology. Such systems can exhibit remarkable phenomena such as quasiparticles with anyonic statistics and have been proposed as candidates for naturally error-free quantum computation. However, anyons have never been observed in nature directly. Here, we describe how to unambiguously detect and characterize such states in recently proposed spin&#8211;lattice realizations using ultracold atoms or molecules trapped in an optical lattice. We propose an experimentally feasible technique to access non-local degrees of freedom by carrying out global operations on trapped spins mediated by an optical cavity mode. We show how to reliably read and write topologically protected quantum memory using an atomic or photonic qubit. Furthermore, our technique can be used to probe statistics and dynamics of anyonic excitations.</p>",[],False,"[""Liang Jiang"", ""Gavin K. Brennen"", ""Alexey V.

article,Probing quantum and thermal noise in an interacting many-body system,"<p>The probabilistic character of the measurement process is one of the most puzzling and fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics. In many-body systems quantum-mechanical noise reveals non-local correlations of the underlying many-body states. Here, we provide a complete experimental analysis of the shot-to-shot variations of interference-fringe contrast for pairs of independently created one-dimensional Bose condensates. Analysing different system sizes, we observe the crossover from thermal to quantum noise, reflected in a characteristic change in the distribution functions from poissonian to Gumbel type, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions on the basis of the Luttinger-liquid formalism. We present the first experimental observation of quasi-long-range order in one-dimensional atomic condensates, which is a hallmark of quantum fluctuations in one-dimensional systems. Furthermore, our experiments constitute the first analysis of the full distribution of quantum noise in an interacting many-body system.</p>",[],False,"[""S. Hofferberth"", ""I. Lesanovsky"", ""T.

article,Oscillations and interactions of dark and dark–bright solitons in Bose–Einstein condensates,"<p>Solitons are among the most distinguishing fundamental excitations in a wide range of nonlinear systems such as water in narrow channels, high-speed optical communication, molecular biology and astrophysics. Stabilized by a balance between spreading and focusing, solitons are wave packets that share some exceptional generic features such as form stability and particle-like properties. Ultracold quantum gases represent very pure and well-controlled nonlinear systems, therefore offering unique possibilities to study soliton dynamics. Here, we report on the observation of long-lived dark and dark&#8211;bright solitons with lifetimes of up to several seconds as well as their dynamics in highly stable optically trapped <sup>87</sup>Rb Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates. In particular, our detailed studies of dark and dark&#8211;bright soliton oscillations reveal the particle-like nature of these collective excitations for the first time.
