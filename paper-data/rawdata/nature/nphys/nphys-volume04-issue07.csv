progress article,"Universal emission intermittency in quantum dots, nanorods and nanowires","<p>Virtually all known fluorophores exhibit mysterious episodes of emission intermittency. A remarkable feature of the phenomenon is a power-law distribution of on- and off-times observed in colloidal semiconductor quantum dots, nanorods, nanowires and some organic dyes. For nanoparticles, the resulting power law extends over an extraordinarily wide dynamic range: nine orders of magnitude in probability density and five to six orders of magnitude in time. Exponents hover about the ubiquitous value of &#8722;3/2. Dark states routinely last for tens of seconds&#8212;practically forever on quantum mechanical timescales. Despite such infinite states of darkness, the dots miraculously recover and start emitting again. Although the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains a mystery and many questions persist, we argue that substantial theoretical progress has been made.</p>",[],False,"[""Pavel Frantsuzov"", ""Masaru Kuno"", ""Boldizs\u00e1r Jank\u00f3"", ""Rudolph A.

article,Measuring nanomechanical motion with a microwave cavity interferometer,"<p>A mechanical resonator is a physicist&#8217;s most tangible example of a harmonic oscillator. With the advent of micro and nanoscale mechanical resonators, researchers are rapidly progressing towards a tangible harmonic oscillator with motion that requires a quantum description. Challenges include freezing out the thermomechanical motion to leave only zero-point quantum fluctuations &#948; x<sub>zp</sub> and, equally importantly, realizing a Heisenberg-limited displacement detector. Here, we introduce a detector that can be in principle quantum limited and is also capable of efficiently coupling to the motion of small-mass, nanoscale objects, which have the most accessible zero-point motion. Specifically, we measure the displacement of a nanomechanical beam using a superconducting transmission-line microwave cavity. We realize excellent mechanical force sensitivity (3&#8201;aN&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>), detect thermal motion at tens of millikelvin temperatures and achieve a displacement imprecision of 30 times the standard quantum limit.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

article,Observation of quantum-measurement backaction with an ultracold atomic gas,"<p>Current research on micromechanical resonators strives for quantum-limited detection of the motion of macroscopic objects. Prerequisite to this goal is the observation of measurement backaction consistent with quantum metrology limits. However, thermal noise currently dominates measurements and precludes ground-state preparation of the resonator. Here, we establish the collective motion of an ultracold atomic gas confined tightly within a Fabry&#8211;Perot optical cavity as a system for investigating the quantum mechanics of macroscopic bodies. The cavity-mode structure selects a particular collective vibrational motion that is measured by the cavity&#8217;s optical properties, actuated by the cavity optical field and subject to backaction by the quantum force fluctuations of this field. Experimentally, we quantify such fluctuations by measuring the cavity-light-induced heating of the intracavity atomic ensemble. These measurements represent the first observation of backaction on a macroscopic mechanical resonator at the standard quantum&#160;limit.</p>",[],False,"[""Kater W. Murch"", ""Kevin L.

article,Attosecond angular streaking,"<p>Ultrashort measurement-time resolution is traditionally obtained in pump&#8211;probe experiments, for which two ultrashort light pulses are required; the time resolution is then determined by the pulse duration. But although pulses of subfemtosecond duration are available, so far the energy of these pulses is too low to fully implement the traditional pump&#8211;probe technique. Here, we demonstrate &#8216;attosecond angular streaking&#8217;, an alternative approach to achieving attosecond time resolution. The method uses the rotating electric-field vector of an intense circularly polarized pulse to deflect photo-ionized electrons in the radial spatial direction; the instant of ionization is then mapped to the final angle of the momentum vector in the polarization plane. We resolved subcycle dynamics in tunnelling ionization by the streaking field alone and demonstrate a temporal localization accuracy of 24&#8201;as&#8201;r.m.s. and an estimated resolution of &#8776;200&#8201;as.

article,Discovery of an excited pair state in superfluid 3He,"<p>Collective modes are the fingerprint of a condensed phase. The spectroscopy of these modes in superfluid <sup>3</sup>He and unconventional superconductors can provide key information on the symmetry of the condensate as well as the microscopic pairing mechanism responsible for the ground state and excitation energies. Here, we use interferometry within an acoustic cavity&#8212;which is very sensitive to changes in the velocity of transverse sound&#8212;to reveal a new collective mode in the B phase of superfluid <sup>3</sup>He (<sup>3</sup>He-B). We identify the mode as an excited bound state of Cooper pairs, which is weakly bound with an excitation energy within 1% of the pair-breaking edge. On the basis of the selection rules for coupling of transverse sound to a collective mode in <sup>3</sup>He-B, combined with the observation of acoustic birefringence near the collective mode frequency, we infer that the new mode is most likely a spin-triplet (S=1), f-wave pair exciton (orbital momentum L=3) with total angular momentum, J=4. The existence of a pair exciton with J=4 suggests an attractive, subdominant, f-wave pairing interaction in liquid <sup>3</sup>He.</p>",[],False,"[""J. P. Davis"", ""J. Pollanen"", ""H. Choi"", ""J.
