article,Dislocations and vortices in pair-density-wave superconductors,"<p>With the groundbreaking work of Fulde, Ferrell, Larkin and Ovchinnikov, it was realized that superconducting order can also break translational invariance, leading to a phase in which the Cooper pairs develop a coherent periodic spatially oscillating structure. Such pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductivity has become relevant in a diverse range of systems, including cuprates, organic superconductors, heavy-fermion superconductors, cold atoms and high-density quark matter. Here we show that, in addition to charge-density-wave (CDW) order, there are PDW ground states that induce spin-density-wave (SDW) order when there is no applied magnetic field. Furthermore, we show that PDW phases support topological defects that combine dislocations in the induced CDW/SDW order with a fractional vortex in the usual superconducting order. These defects provide a mechanism for fluctuation-driven non-superconducting CDW/SDW phases and conventional vortices with CDW/SDW order in the core.</p>",[],False,"[""D. F. Agterberg"", ""H.

article,Heavy electrons and the symplectic symmetry of spin,"<p>The recent discovery of two heavy-fermion materials PuCoGa<sub>5</sub> and NpPd<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>, which transform directly from Curie paramagnets into superconductors, reveals a new class of superconductors where local moments quench directly into the superconducting condensate. Unlike other heavy-electron superconductors, where Cooper pairing is thought to be driven by spin fluctuations, these higher-transition-temperature materials do not seem to be close to a magnetic instability. Large-N expansions have been invaluable in describing heavy-fermion metals, but so far cannot treat superconductivity. Here, we introduce a new class of large-N expansion that uses symplectic symmetry to protect the odd time-reversal parity of spin and sustain Cooper pairs as well-defined singlets. We show that when a lattice of magnetic ions exchange spin with their metallic environment in two distinct symmetry channels, they can simultaneously satisfy both channels by forming a condensate of composite pairs between local moments and electrons. In the tetragonal crystalline environment relevant to PuCoGa<sub>5</sub> and NpPd<sub>5</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>, the lattice structure selects a natural pair of spin exchange channels, predicting a unique anisotropic paired state with either d- or g-wave symmetry. This pairing mechanism also predicts a large upturn in the NMR relaxation rate above T<sub>c</sub> and strong enhancement of Andreev reflection in tunnelling measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""Rebecca Flint"", ""M.

article,Localization and loss of coherence in molecular double-slit experiments,"<p>In molecular double-slit experiments, the interference between emitted core electrons of diatomic molecules gives rise to oscillations in the observed electron intensity. Here, we explore this behaviour for photoelectrons emitted from CO and N<sub>2</sub> by soft X-ray ionization in the molecular frame, and we argue that in addition to the undisturbed emission process, intramolecular scattering can lead to electron interference between the scattered and unscattered wave in two ways: two-centre interference between two spatially coherent emitters and one-centre self-interference. The latter is the signature of a loss of spatial coherence. The spatial scale over which the transition from two-centre to one-centre coherence occurs is the de Broglie wavelength of the scattered photoelectron in units of the bond length. These results highlight the fact that the molecular double slit is based on two independent uncertainty principles, &#916;p<sub>x</sub>&#916;x and &#916;E&#916;t, the second of which causes ongoing tunnelling between the two centres, even after the collapse of the electron wavefunction in real space.</p>",[],False,"[""Bj\u00f6rn Zimmermann"", ""Daniel Rolles"", ""Burkhard Langer"", ""Rainer Hentges"", ""Markus Braune"", ""Slobodan Cvejanovic"", ""Oliver Ge\u00dfner"", ""Franz Heiser"", ""Sanja Korica"", ""Toralf Lischke"", ""Axel Reink\u00f6ster"", ""Jens Viefhaus"", ""Reinhard D\u00f6rner"", ""Vincent McKoy"", ""Uwe Becker""]","Zimmermann, B., Rolles, D., Langer, B. et al.

article,Gate-induced quantum-confinement transition of a single dopant atom in a silicon FinFET,"<p>The ability to build structures with atomic precision is one of the defining features of nanotechnology. Achieving true atomic-level functionality, however, requires the ability to control the wavefunctions of individual atoms. Here, we investigate an approach that could enable just that. By collecting and analysing transport spectra of a single donor atom in the channel of a silicon FinFET, we present experimental evidence for the emergence of a new type of hybrid molecule system. Our experiments and simulations suggest that the transistor&#8217;s gate potential can be used to control the degree of hybridization of a single electron donor state between the nuclear potential of its donor atom and a nearby quantum well. Moreover, our theoretical analysis enables us to determine the species of donor (arsenic) implanted into each device as well as the degree of confinement imposed by the gate.</p>",[],False,"[""G. P.
