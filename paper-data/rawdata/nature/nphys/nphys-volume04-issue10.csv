article,"Dynamic light diffusion, three-dimensional Anderson localization and lasing in inverted opals","<p>Photons propagate in photonic crystals in the same way as electrons propagate in solids. The periodical refractive index induces forbidden frequency bands, which nurture a variety of novel integrated devices and several fundamental studies ranging from threshold-less lasers to quantum computing. However, these investigations have to face the unavoidable disorder of real-world structures: if on one hand it largely hampers experiments, on the other hand it opens the possibility to study three-dimensional (3D) photon strong localization. We report on 3D+1 Maxwell&#8211;Bloch simulations of light dynamics in inverted opals exhibiting a complete photonic bandgap. We show that the disorder-induced localized states strongly alter the photonic crystal&#8217;s response to femtosecond optical pulses, drastically reducing the diffusion constant and trapping light. We find that an optimal amount of randomness favours the strongest localization; correspondingly, self-starting laser processes are mediated by Anderson states that prevail over spatially extended Bloch modes.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

article,How to make a bilayer exciton condensate flow,"<p>Among the many examples of Bose condensation considered in physics, electron&#8211;hole-pair (exciton) condensation has maintained special interest because of controversy about condensate properties. Although ideal condensates can support an exciton supercurrent, it has not been clear how such a current could be induced or detected. This paper addresses the electrical generation of exciton supercurrents in bilayer condensates (systems in which the electrons and holes are in separate layers) and reaches a surprising conclusion. We find that steady-state dissipationless currents cannot be induced simply by connecting the two layers in series to guarantee opposite currents in electron and hole layers, as has long been supposed. Instead, current should be injected into and removed from the same layer, and a conducting channel supplied to close the counterflow portion of supercurrent in the other layer.</p>",[],False,"[""Jung-Jung Su"", ""A.

article,Bias-driven high-power microwave emission from MgO-based tunnel magnetoresistance devices,"<p>Spin-momentum transfer between a spin-polarized current and a ferromagnetic layer can induce steady-state magnetization precession, and has recently been proposed as a working principle for ubiquitous radio-frequency devices for radar and telecommunication applications. However, so far, the development of industrially attractive prototypes has been hampered by the inability to identify systems that can provide enough power. Here, we demonstrate that microwave signals with device-compatible output power levels can be generated from a single magnetic tunnel junction with a lateral size of 100&#8201;nm, seven orders of magnitude smaller than conventional radio-frequency oscillators. We find that in MgO magnetic tunnel junctions the perpendicular torque induced by the spin-polarized current on the local magnetization can reach 25% of the in-plane spin-torque term, although showing a different bias dependence. Both findings contrast with the results obtained on all-metallic structures, previously investigated, reflecting the fundamentally different transport mechanisms in the two types of structure.</p>",[],False,"[""Alina M.

article,High-sensitivity diamond magnetometer with nanoscale resolution,"<p>The detection of weak magnetic fields with high spatial resolution is an important problem in diverse areas ranging from fundamental physics and material science to data storage and biomedical science. Here, we explore a novel approach to the detection of weak magnetic fields that takes advantage of recently developed techniques for the coherent control of solid-state electron spin quantum bits. Specifically, we investigate a magnetic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centres in room-temperature diamond. We discuss two important applications of this technique: a nanoscale magnetometer that could potentially detect precession of single nuclear spins and an optical magnetic-field imager combining spatial resolution ranging from micrometres to millimetres with a sensitivity approaching a few fT&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>.</p>",[],False,"[""J.
