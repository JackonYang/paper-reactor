article,High-resolution scanning electron microscopy of an ultracold quantum gas,"<p>Our knowledge of ultracold quantum gases is strongly influenced by our ability to probe these objects. In situ imaging combined with single-atom sensitivity is an especially appealing scenario, as it can provide direct information on the structure and the correlations of such systems. For a precise characterization a high spatial resolution is mandatory. In particular, the perspective to study quantum gases in optical lattices makes a resolution well below one micrometre highly desirable. Here, we report on a novel microscopy technique, which is based on scanning electron microscopy and allows for the detection of single atoms inside a quantum gas with a spatial resolution of better than 150&#8201;nm. We document the great functionality of this technique by precise density measurements of a trapped Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate and the first experimental demonstration of single-site addressability in a submicrometre optical&#160;lattice.</p>",[],False,"[""Tatjana Gericke"", ""Peter W\u00fcrtz"", ""Daniel Reitz"", ""Tim Langen"", ""Herwig Ott""]","Gericke, T., Würtz, P., Reitz, D. et al.

article,Optical lattice clocks with non-interacting bosons and fermions,"<p>Quantum statistics fundamentally controls the way particles interact; bosons tend to bunch together, whereas fermions repulse each other. As a consequence, statistically different isotopes are found in different macroscopic quantum states at ultracold temperatures. This is related to the total atomic spin, which forces atoms to couple to ambient fields. In designing high-precision atomic clocks that operate at a fractional uncertainty of 10<sup>&#8722;15</sup> or less, quantum statistics and therefore the spins of the interrogated atoms have an essential role in determining the clocks&#8217; ultimate performance. Here, we discuss the design of optical lattice clocks in view of the quantum statistics and lattice geometries. We propose two configurations that both make the interrogated atoms non-interacting: spin-polarized fermions in a one-dimensional (1D) and bosons in a 3D lattice. A 3D clock with bosonic <sup>88</sup>Sr is demonstrated for the first time, in addition to a 1D clock with fermionic <sup>87</sup>Sr. The sequential operation of the two clocks enables us to evaluate the clock stability with an uncertainty below 1&#215;10<sup>&#8722;15</sup> and to determine the isotope shift with significant reduction of the uncertainty related to atomic collisions.</p>",[],False,"[""Tomoya Akatsuka"", ""Masao Takamoto"", ""Hidetoshi Katori""]","Akatsuka, T., Takamoto, M. & Katori, H.

article,Microrheology of a sticking transition,"<p>The phenomenon of sticking of one object to another, which drastically reduces their relative motion, is ubiquitous in nature. We have studied the sticking process of a colloid, suspended in a fluid medium by an optical tweezer, to a rigid substrate. The evolution of the frictional coupling between the two as a function of their separation is detected by the diffusivity of the particle and also by its phase-sensitive response to an in-plane external oscillatory drive applied to the substrate. On contact, the coupling changes abruptly from viscous to elastic for a rigid silica particle, whereas it evolves slowly with time, similar to ageing in glassy systems, for a soft and deformable polystyrene particle. Depending on the relative strengths of the particle&#8211;substrate interaction, the tweezer potential and the external drive, three regimes of dynamics&#8212;stuck, ageing and non-stuck&#8212;are observed in the dynamical phase diagram.</p>",[],False,"[""Prerna Sharma"", ""Shankar Ghosh"", ""S.

article,Reliable neuronal logic devices from patterned hippocampal cultures,"<p>Functional logical microcircuits are an essential building block of computation in the brain. However, single neuronal connections are unreliable, and it is unclear how neuronal ensembles can be constructed to achieve high response fidelity. Here, we show that reliable, mesoscale logical devices can be created in vitro by geometrical design of neural cultures. We control the connections and activity by assembling living neural networks on quasi-one-dimensional configurations. The linear geometry yields reliable transmission lines. Incorporating thin lines creates &#8216;threshold&#8217; devices and logical &#8216;AND gates&#8217;. Breaking the symmetry of transmission makes neuronal &#8216;diodes&#8217;. All of these function with error rates well below that of a single connection. The von Neumann model of redundancy and error correction accounts well for all of the devices, giving a quantitative estimate for the reliability of a neuronal connection and of threshold devices. These neuronal devices may contribute to the implementation of computation in vitro and, ultimately, to its understanding in vivo.</p>",[],False,"[""Ofer Feinerman"", ""Assaf Rotem"", ""Elisha Moses""]","Feinerman, O., Rotem, A. & Moses, E.
