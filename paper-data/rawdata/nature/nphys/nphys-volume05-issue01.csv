progress article,Measurement-based quantum computation,"<p>Quantum computation offers a promising new kind of information processing, where the non-classical features of quantum mechanics are harnessed and exploited. A number of models of quantum computation exist. These models have been shown to be formally equivalent, but their underlying elementary concepts and the requirements for their practical realization can differ significantly. A particularly exciting paradigm is that of measurement-based quantum computation, where the processing of quantum information takes place by rounds of simple measurements on qubits prepared in a highly entangled state. We review recent developments in measurement-based quantum computation with a view to both fundamental and practical issues, in particular the power of quantum computation, the protection against noise (fault tolerance) and steps towards experimental realization. Finally, we highlight a number of connections between this field and other branches of physics and mathematics.</p>",[],False,"[""H. J. Briegel"", ""D. E. Browne"", ""W. D\u00fcr"", ""R.

article,Superconducting nanocircuits for topologically protected qubits,"<p>For successful realization of a quantum computer, its building blocks&#8212;the individual qubits&#8212;should be simultaneously scalable and sufficiently protected from environmental noise. Recently, a novel approach to the protection of superconducting qubits has been proposed. The idea is to prevent errors at the hardware level, by building a fault-free logical qubit from &#8216;faulty&#8217; physical qubits with properly engineered interactions between them. The decoupling of such a topologically protected logical qubit from local noises is expected to grow exponentially with the number of physical qubits. Here, we report on proof-of-concept experiments with a prototype device that consists of twelve physical qubits made of nanoscale Josephson junctions. We observed that owing to properly tuned quantum fluctuations, this qubit is protected against magnetic flux variations well beyond linear order, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that topologically protected superconducting qubits are feasible.</p>",[],False,"[""Sergey Gladchenko"", ""David Olaya"", ""Eva Dupont-Ferrier"", ""Benoit Dou\u00e7ot"", ""Lev B.

article,"Size and mobility of excitons in (6, 5) carbon nanotubes","<p>Knowledge of excited-state dynamics in carbon nanotubes is determinant for their prospective use in optoelectronic applications. It is known that primary photoexcitations are quasi-one-dimensional excitons, the electron&#8211;hole correlation length (&#8216;exciton size&#8217;) of which corresponds to a finite volume in the phase space. This volume can be directly measured by nonlinear spectroscopy provided the time resolution is short enough for probing before population relaxation. Here, we report on the experimental determination of exciton size and mobility in (6, 5) carbon nanotubes. The samples are sodium cholate suspensions of nanotubes (produced by the CoMoCat method) obtained by density-gradient ultracentrifugation. By using sub-15&#8201;fs near-infrared pulses to measure the nascent bleach of the lowest exciton resonance, we estimate the exciton size to be 2.0&#177;0.7&#8201;nm. Exciton&#8211;exciton annihilation in our samples is found to be rather inefficient so that many excitons can coexist on a single&#160;nanotube.</p>",[],False,"[""Larry L\u00fcer"", ""Sajjad Hoseinkhani"", ""Dario Polli"", ""Jared Crochet"", ""Tobias Hertel"", ""Guglielmo Lanzani""]","Lüer, L., Hoseinkhani, S., Polli, D. et al.

article,Atomic and molecular signatures for charged-particle ionization,"<p>The way in which atoms and molecules are ionized by the impact of charged particles has important consequences for the behaviour of many physical systems, from gas lasers to astrophysical plasmas. Much of our understanding of this process has come from ionization measurements of the energy and angular distribution of electrons ejected in the same plane as the trajectory of the incident ionizing beam. Such studies suggest that the mechanisms governing the ionization of atoms and molecules are essentially the same. But by measuring the electrons ejected from a gas in a plane perpendicular to the incident beam, we show this is not always the case. Experiments and quantum mechanical calculations enable us to construct a remarkably accurate classical picture of the physics of charged-particle ionization. This model predicts that the differences in ionization behaviour arise in molecules that do not have nuclei at their centres of mass.</p>",[],False,"[""Ola Al-Hagan"", ""Christian Kaiser"", ""Don Madison"", ""Andrew James Murray""]","Al-Hagan, O., Kaiser, C., Madison, D. et al.

article,Structure from fleeting illumination of faint spinning objects in flight,"<p>Moves are afoot to illuminate particles in flight with powerful X-ray bursts, to determine the structure of single molecules, viruses and nanoparticles. This would circumvent important limitations of current techniques, including the need to condense molecules into pure crystals. Proposals to reconstruct the molecular structure from diffraction &#8216;snapshots&#8217; of unknown orientation, however, require &#8764;1,000 times more signal than available from next-generation sources. Using a new approach, we demonstrate the recovery of the structure of a weakly scattering macromolecule at the anticipated next-generation X-ray source intensities. Our work closes a critical gap in determining the structure of single molecules and nanoparticles by X-ray methods, and opens the way to reconstructing the structure of spinning, or randomly oriented objects at extremely low signal levels.</p>",[],False,"[""Russell Fung"", ""Valentin Shneerson"", ""Dilano K.

article,Multiphase transformation and Ostwald's rule of stages during crystallization of a metal phosphate,"<p>Although the classical picture of crystallization depicts a simple and immediate transformation from an amorphous to a crystalline phase, it has been argued that, in selected systems, intermediate metastable phases exist before a stable state is finally reached. However, most experimental observations have been limited to colloids and proteins, for which the crystallization kinetics are fairly slow and the size is comparatively large. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in an inorganic compound at an atomic scale that an amorphous phase transforms into a stable crystalline state via intermediate crystalline phases, thus directly proving Ostwald&#8217;s rule of stages. Through in situ high-resolution electron microscopy in real time at a high temperature, we show the presence of metastable transient phases at an atomic scale during the crystallization of an olivine-type metal phosphate.

article,Navigability of complex networks,"<p>Routing information through networks is a universal phenomenon in both natural and man-made complex systems. When each node has full knowledge of the global network connectivity, finding short communication paths is merely a matter of distributed computation. However, in many real networks, nodes communicate efficiently even without such global intelligence. Here, we show that the peculiar structural characteristics of many complex networks support efficient communication without global knowledge. We also describe a general mechanism that explains this connection between network structure and function. This mechanism relies on the presence of a metric space hidden behind an observable network. Our findings suggest that real networks in nature have underlying metric spaces that remain undiscovered. Their discovery should have practical applications in a wide range of areas where networks are used to model complex systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Mari\u00e1n Bogu\u00f1\u00e1"", ""Dmitri Krioukov"", ""K.
