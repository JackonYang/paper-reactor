article,Simplifying quantum logic using higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces,"<p>Quantum computation promises to solve fundamental, yet otherwise intractable, problems across a range of active fields of research. Recently, universal quantum logic-gate sets&#8212;the elemental building blocks for a quantum computer&#8212;have been demonstrated in several physical architectures. A serious obstacle to a full-scale implementation is the large number of these gates required to build even small quantum circuits. Here, we present and demonstrate a general technique that harnesses multi-level information carriers to significantly reduce this number, enabling the construction of key quantum circuits with existing technology. We present implementations of two key quantum circuits: the three-qubit Toffoli gate and the general two-qubit controlled-unitary gate. Although our experiment is carried out in a photonic architecture, the technique is independent of the particular physical encoding of quantum information, and has the potential for wider application.</p>",[],False,"[""Benjamin P.

article,A key role for unusual spin dynamics in ferropnictides,"<p>The discovery of high-T<sub>c</sub> ferropnictides introduced a new family of superconductors, and has already revealed a complicated and often contradictory picture of the structural and magnetic properties. An almost unprecedented sensitivity of the calculated magnetism and Fermi surface to structural details prevents correspondence to experiment. Experimental probes of the order parameter are in surprisingly strong disagreement, even considering the relative immaturity of the field. We outline various and seemingly contradictory evidence, both theoretical and experimental, and show it can be rectified by assuming a large-moment spin density wave, well defined but with magnetic twin and antiphase boundaries, dynamic on the experimental timescale. Under this assumption, calculations can accurately reproduce even very fine details of the structure, and a natural explanation for the temperature separation of structural and magnetic transitions is provided. Thus, our theory restores agreement between experiment and theory in crucial areas, making further cooperative progress possible on both fronts.</p>",[],False,"[""I. I. Mazin"", ""M. D.

article,Diffraction-limited performance and focusing of high harmonics from relativistic plasmas,"<p>When a pulse of light reflects from a mirror that is travelling close to the speed of light, Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity predicts that it will be up-shifted to a substantially higher frequency and compressed to a much shorter duration. This scenario is realized by the relativistically oscillating plasma surface generated by an ultraintense laser focused onto a solid target. Until now, it has been unclear whether the conditions necessary to exploit such phenomena can survive such an extreme interaction with increasing laser intensity. Here, we provide the first quantitative evidence to suggest that they can. We show that the occurrence of surface smoothing on the scale of the wavelength of the generated harmonics, and plasma denting of the irradiated surface, enables the production of high-quality X-ray beams focused down to the diffraction limit. These results improve the outlook for generating extreme X-ray fields, which could in principle extend to the Schwinger limit.</p>",[],False,"[""B. Dromey"", ""D. Adams"", ""R. H\u00f6rlein"", ""Y.

article,Tuning intermolecular interaction in long-range-ordered submonolayer organic films,"<p>The future success of organic electronic devices strongly depends on the ability to tailor the properties of thin films and interfaces. This calls for well-ordered thin films. However, their properties are dominantly influenced by the formation of the first molecular layer representing a template for further growth. The development of the first layer&#8212;in turn&#8212;depends on the fine balance of molecule&#8211;substrate and molecule&#8211;molecule interaction. The latter is usually attractive owing to van der Waals forces and causes the formation of islands and small crystalline grains. Here, we report on organic adsorbates exhibiting a repulsive intermolecular interaction. With increasing coverage, Sn-phthalocyanine molecules continuously rearrange on Ag(111) in a series of ordered superstructures. They always fill the surface terraces homogeneously and maximize the domain size. Thicker films also exhibit extremely large, monocrystalline grains and potentially enable bulk-like properties for thin films. The intermolecular interaction can be tuned by cooling and becomes attractive below &#8764;120&#8201;K.</p>",[],False,"[""Christoph Stadler"", ""S\u00f6ren Hansen"", ""Ingo Kr\u00f6ger"", ""Christian Kumpf"", ""Eberhard Umbach""]","Stadler, C., Hansen, S., Kröger, I. et al.
