article,One-dimensional topologically protected modes in topological insulators with lattice dislocations,"<p>Topological defects, such as domain walls and vortices, have long fascinated physicists. A novel twist is added in quantum systems such as the B-phase of superfluid helium He<sub>3</sub>, where vortices are associated with low-energy excitations in the cores. Similarly, cosmic strings may be tied to propagating fermion modes. Can analogous phenomena occur in crystalline solids that host a plethora of topological defects? Here, we show that indeed dislocation lines are associated with one-dimensional fermionic excitations in a &#8216;topological insulator&#8217;, a novel phase of matter believed to be realized in the material Bi<sub>0.9</sub>Sb<sub>0.1</sub>. In contrast to fermionic excitations in a regular quantum wire, these modes are topologically protected and not scattered by disorder. As dislocations are ubiquitous in real materials, these excitations could dominate spin and charge transport in topological insulators. Our results provide a novel route to creating a potentially ideal quantum wire in a bulk solid.</p>",[],False,"[""Ying Ran"", ""Yi Zhang"", ""Ashvin Vishwanath""]","Ran, Y., Zhang, Y. & Vishwanath, A.

article,Electric displacement as the fundamental variable in electronic-structure calculations,"<p>Finite-field calculations in periodic insulators are technically and conceptually challenging, owing to fundamental problems in defining polarization in extended solids. Although significant progress has been made recently with the establishment of techniques to fix the electric field E or the macroscopic polarization P in first-principles calculations, both methods lack the ease of use and conceptual clarity of standard zero-field calculations. Here we develop a new formalism, in which the electric displacement D, rather than E or P, is the fundamental electrical variable. Fixing D has the intuitive interpretation of imposing open-circuit electrical boundary conditions, which is particularly useful in studying ferroelectric systems. Furthermore, the analogy to open-circuit capacitors suggests an appealing reformulation in terms of free charges and potentials, which dramatically simplifies the treatment of stresses and strains. Using PbTiO<sub>3</sub> as an example, we show that our technique enables full control over the electrical variables within the density functional formalism.</p>",[],False,"[""Massimiliano Stengel"", ""Nicola A.
