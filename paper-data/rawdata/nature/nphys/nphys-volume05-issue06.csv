article,Vortex nucleation as a case study of symmetry breaking in quantum systems,"<p>Mean-field methods are a very powerful tool for investigating weakly interacting many-body systems in many branches of physics. In particular, they describe with excellent accuracy trapped Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates. A generic, but difficult question concerns the relation between the symmetry properties of the true many-body state and its mean-field approximation. Here, we address this question by considering, theoretically, vortex nucleation in a rotating Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate. A slow sweep of the rotation frequency changes the state of the system from being at rest to the one containing one vortex. Within the mean-field framework, the jump in symmetry occurs through a turbulent phase around a certain critical frequency. The exact many-body ground state at the critical frequency exhibits strong correlations and entanglement. We believe that this constitutes a paradigm example of symmetry breaking in&#8212;or change of the order parameter of&#8212;quantum many-body systems in the course of adiabatic evolution.</p>",[],False,"[""D.

article,"Topological insulators in Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 with a single Dirac cone on the surface","<p>Topological insulators are new states of quantum matter in which surface states residing in the bulk insulating gap of such systems are protected by time-reversal symmetry. The study of such states was originally inspired by the robustness to scattering of conducting edge states in quantum Hall systems. Recently, such analogies have resulted in the discovery of topologically protected states in two-dimensional and three-dimensional band insulators with large spin&#8211;orbit coupling. So far, the only known three-dimensional topological insulator is Bi<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>, which is an alloy with complex surface states. Here, we present the results of first-principles electronic structure calculations of the layered, stoichiometric crystals Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. Our calculations predict that Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> are topological insulators, whereas Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> is not. These topological insulators have robust and simple surface states consisting of a single Dirac cone at the &#915; point. In addition, we predict that Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> has a topologically non-trivial energy gap of 0.3&#8201;eV, which is larger than the energy scale of room temperature. We further present a simple and unified continuum model that captures the salient topological features of this class of materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Haijun Zhang"", ""Chao-Xing Liu"", ""Xiao-Liang Qi"", ""Xi Dai"", ""Zhong Fang"", ""Shou-Cheng Zhang""]","Zhang, H., Liu, CX., Qi, XL. et al.

article,The distribution of spatially averaged critical properties,"<p>Critical properties throughout science are popularly associated with heavy-tailed distributions, but experimental evidence indicates several alternative, and very different, functional forms. Until now there has been no clear understanding of why this is, nor any general criterion as to which form to expect in a given practical situation. Here, a general scaling argument is presented, specific to spatially averaged properties, that indicates the following simple rule: if the mean value increases rapidly with system size then a power-law distribution is appropriate; if it changes slowly then a &#8216;generalized Gumbel distribution&#8217; is likely, and if it decreases rapidly then an exponentially truncated power-law distribution is appropriate. The three scenarios are connected with the well-established classification of a scaling variable as either irrelevant, marginal or relevant. This result is supported by the current data set and finally renders comprehensible the fact that real critical properties exhibit diverse and apparently unrelated distributions, instead of ubiquitous heavy tails.</p>",[],False,"[""Steven T.
