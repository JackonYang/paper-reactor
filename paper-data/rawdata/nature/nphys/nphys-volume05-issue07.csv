article,Individual topological tunnelling events of a quantum field probed through their macroscopic consequences,"<p>Phase slips are topological fluctuations that carry the superconducting order-parameter field between distinct current-carrying states. Owing to these phase slips, superconducting nanowires acquire electrical resistance. In such wires, it is well known that at higher temperatures phase slips occur through the process of thermal barrier-crossing by the order-parameter field. At low temperatures, the general expectation is that phase slips should proceed through quantum tunnelling events, which are known as quantum phase slips. However, resistive measurements have produced evidence both for and against the occurrence of quantum phase slips. Here, we report evidence for the observation of individual quantum phase-slip events in homogeneous ultranarrow wires at high bias currents. We accomplish this through measurements of the distribution of switching currents for which the width exhibits a rather counter-intuitive, monotonic increase with decreasing temperature. Importantly, measurements show that in nanowires with larger critical currents, quantum fluctuations dominate thermal fluctuations up to higher temperatures.</p>",[],False,"[""Mitrabhanu Sahu"", ""Myung-Ho Bae"", ""Andrey Rogachev"", ""David Pekker"", ""Tzu-Chieh Wei"", ""Nayana Shah"", ""Paul M.

article,Resolved-sideband cooling and position measurement of a micromechanical oscillator close to the Heisenberg uncertainty limit,"<p>The theory of quantum measurement of mechanical motion, describing the mutual coupling of a meter and a measured object, predicts a variety of phenomena such as quantum backaction, quantum correlations and non-classical states of motion. In spite of great experimental efforts, mostly based on nano-electromechanical systems, probing these in a laboratory setting has as yet eluded researchers. Cavity optomechanical systems, in which a high-quality optical resonator is parametrically coupled to a mechanical oscillator, hold great promise as a route towards the observation of such effects with macroscopic oscillators. Here, we present measurements on optomechanical systems exhibiting radiofrequency (62&#8211;122&#8201;MHz) mechanical modes, cooled to very low occupancy using a combination of cryogenic precooling and resolved-sideband laser cooling. The lowest achieved occupancy is n&#8764;63. Optical measurements of these ultracold oscillators&#8217; motion are shown to perform in a near-ideal manner, exhibiting an imprecision&#8211;backaction product about one order of magnitude lower than the results obtained with nano-electromechanical transducers.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Coherent ultrafast magnetism induced by femtosecond laser pulses,"<p>The quest for ultrafast magnetic processes has triggered a new field of research&#8212;femtomagnetism: using femtosecond laser pulses to demagnetize ferromagnetic metallic thin films. Despite being the subject of intense research for over a decade, the underlying mechanisms that govern the demagnetization remain unclear. Here, we investigate how an ultrashort laser pulse couples to the spin of electrons in ferromagnetic metals. It is shown that a single 50-fs laser pulse couples efficiently to a ferromagnetic film during its own propagation. This result indicates that the material polarization induced by the photon field interacts coherently with the spins. The corresponding mechanism has its origin in relativistic quantum electrodynamics, beyond the spin&#8211;orbit interaction involving the ionic potential. In addition, this coherent interaction is clearly distinguished from the incoherent ultrafast demagnetization associated with the thermalization of the spins. We forecast that the corresponding coherent self-induced processes are the dawn of a new era for future research in magnetism.</p>",[],False,"[""Jean-Yves Bigot"", ""Mircea Vomir"", ""Eric Beaurepaire""]","Bigot, JY., Vomir, M. & Beaurepaire, E.

article,Experimental onset threshold and magnetic pressure pile-up for 3D reconnection,"<p>Magnetic reconnection changes the topology of magnetic field lines to a lower-energy state. This process can liberate stored magnetic field energy and accelerate particles during unsteady, explosive events. This is one of the most important processes in astrophysical, space and laboratory plasmas. The abrupt onset and cessation has been a long-standing puzzle. We show the first three-dimensional (3D) laboratory example of the onset and stagnation of magnetic reconnection between magnetized and parallel current channels (flux ropes) driven by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) attraction and a 3D plasma-current-driven instability. Antiparallel magnetic field lines carried by these colliding flux ropes annihilate and drive an electric field. The inflow soon exceeds a threshold for the formation of a reconnection current layer. Magnetic flux and pressure pile up just outside this layer, and eventually become large enough to support MHD back-reaction forces that stall the inflow and stagnate the reconnection process.</p>",[],False,"[""T.
