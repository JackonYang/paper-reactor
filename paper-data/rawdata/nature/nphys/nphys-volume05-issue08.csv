article,Field-sensitive addressing and control of field-insensitive neutral-atom qubits,"<p>The establishment of a scalable scheme for quantum computing with addressable and long-lived qubits would provide a route to harnessing the laws of quantum physics to solve classically intractable problems. The design of many proposed platforms for quantum computing is driven by competing needs: isolating the quantum system from the environment to prevent decoherence, and easily and accurately controlling the system with external fields. For example, neutral-atom optical-lattice architectures provide environmental isolation through the use of states that are robust against fluctuating external fields, yet external fields are essential for qubit addressing. Here, we demonstrate the selection of individual qubits with external fields, while the qubits are in field-insensitive superpositions. We use a spatially inhomogeneous external field to map selected qubits to a different field-insensitive superposition, minimally perturbing unselected qubits, despite the fact that the addressing field is not spatially localized. We show robust single-qubit rotations on neutral-atom qubits located at selected lattice sites. This precise coherent control should be more generally applicable to state transfer and qubit isolation in other architectures using field-insensitive qubits.</p>",[],False,"[""N. Lundblad"", ""J. M.

article,Observation of an Efimov spectrum in an atomic system,"<p>In 1970, Vitaly Efimov predicted that three quantum particles subjected to a resonant pair-wise interaction can join into an infinite number of loosely bound states, even if each pair of particles cannot bind. The properties of these aggregates, such as the peculiar geometric scaling of their energy spectrum, are universal, that is, independent of the microscopic details of their components. Despite an extensive search in many different physical systems, including atoms, molecules and nuclei, the characteristic spectrum of Efimov trimer states has not been observed so far. Here, we report on the discovery of two bound trimer states of potassium atoms very close to the Efimov scenario, which we reveal by studying three-particle collisions in an ultracold gas. Our observation provides the first evidence of an Efimov spectrum and enables a direct test of its scaling behaviour, providing potentially general insights into the physics of few-body systems.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

article,Coherent manipulation of Bose–Einstein condensates with state-dependent microwave potentials on an atom chip,"<p>Entanglement-based technologies, such as quantum information processing, quantum simulations and quantum-enhanced metrology, have the potential to revolutionize our way of computing and measuring, and help clarify the puzzling concept of entanglement itself. Ultracold atoms on atom chips are attractive for their implementation, as they provide control over quantum systems in compact, robust and scalable set-ups. An important tool in this system is a potential depending on the internal atomic state. Coherent dynamics in such a potential combined with collisional interactions enables entanglement generation both for individual atoms and ensembles. Here, we demonstrate coherent manipulation of Bose-condensed atoms in a state-dependent potential, generated with microwave near-fields on an atom chip. We reversibly entangle atomic internal and motional states, realizing a trapped-atom interferometer with internal-state labelling. Our system provides control over collisions in mesoscopic condensates, paving the way to on-chip generation of many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology with spin-squeezed states.</p>",[],False,"[""Pascal B\u00f6hi"", ""Max F.

article,Role of shear modulus and statistics in the supersolidity of helium,"<p>The first clear evidence for supersolidity in helium came from experiments in which the resonant period of a torsional oscillator decreased below &#8764;0.2&#8201;K, indicating that some of the solid <sup>4</sup>He decoupled from the oscillation. More recently, shear-modulus measurements on solid <sup>4</sup>He revealed an unexpected increase with the same dependence on temperature and <sup>3</sup>He impurities. The similarities raised the possibility that the period drop in torsion experiments is simply due to the stiffening of the solid. Here, we report the same measurements on solid <sup>3</sup>He, a Fermi solid instead of a Bose solid. The anomalous modulus increase found in hexagonal close-packed (hcp) <sup>4</sup>He, is also found in hcp <sup>3</sup>He. However, in the case of <sup>3</sup>He, the shear modulus increase is not accompanied by a corresponding period change of the torsional oscillator. We conclude that elastic stiffening alone does not produce the changes in the torsional-oscillator period and that decoupling occurs only in a stiffened Bose solid.</p>",[],False,"[""Joshua T.

article,Lévy flights of photons in hot atomic vapours,"<p>The properties of random and fluctuating systems are often studied through the use of Gaussian distributions. However, in a number of situations, rare events have drastic consequences, which cannot be explained by Gaussian statistics. Considerable efforts have thus been devoted to the study of non-Gaussian fluctuations such as L&#233;vy statistics, generalizing the standard description of random walks. Unfortunately, only macroscopic signatures, obtained by averaging over many random steps, are usually observed in physical systems. We present experimental results investigating the elementary process of anomalous diffusion of photons in hot atomic vapours.

article,Directing cell motions on micropatterned ratchets,"<p>Cell motility is a process deriving from the synchronized dynamics of the cytoskeleton. In several important physiological processes&#8212;notably, cancer metastasis&#8212;the randomly moving cells can acquire a directional motility phenotype and bias their motions in response to environmental cues. Despite intense research, however, the current understanding of directional cell migration is incomplete and there is a growing need to develop systems that would enable the study and control of this process. This article demonstrates that random motions of motile cells can be rectified by asymmetric (&#8216;ratchet&#8217;) microgeometries. Interactions between the cells and the imposed geometrical cues guide cell polarization and give rise to directional motility. Depending on the ratchet design, cells of different types can move either in the same or in opposite directions on the same imposed pattern. In the latter case, it is possible to partially sort mixed cell populations into different collecting reservoirs.</p>",[],False,"[""Goher Mahmud"", ""Christopher J. Campbell"", ""Kyle J. M.
