article,The nature of localization in graphene under quantum Hall conditions,"<p>Particle localization is an essential ingredient in quantum Hall physics. In conventional high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems such as in GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor heterostructures, Coulomb interactions were shown to compete with disorder and to have a central role in particle localization. Here, we address the nature of localization in graphene where the carrier mobility, quantifying the disorder, is two to four orders of magnitude smaller than in GaAs two-dimensional electron systems. We image the electronic density of states and the localized state spectrum of a graphene flake in the quantum Hall regime with a scanning single-electron transistor. Our microscopic approach provides direct insight into the nature of localization. Surprisingly, despite strong disorder, our findings indicate that localization in graphene is not dominated by single-particle physics, but rather by a competition between the underlying disorder potential and the repulsive Coulomb interaction responsible for screening.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Spin-injection Hall effect in a planar photovoltaic cell,"<p>Electrical detection of spin-polarized transport in semiconductors is one of the key prerequisites for successful incorporation of spin in semiconductor microelectronics. The present schemes are based on spin-dependent transport effects within the spin generation region in the semiconductor, or on non-local detection outside the spin-injection area using a ferromagnet attached to the semiconductor. Here, we report that polarized injection of carriers can be detected by transverse electrical signals directly along the semiconducting channel, both inside and outside the injection area, without disturbing the spin-polarized current or using magnetic elements. Our planar p&#8211;n diode microdevices enable us to demonstrate Hall effect symmetries and large magnitudes of the measured effect. Supported by microscopic calculations, we infer that the observed spin-injection Hall effect reflects spin dynamics induced by an internal spin&#8211;orbit field and is closely related to the anomalous and spin Hall effects. The spin-injection Hall effect is observed up to high temperatures and our devices represent a realization of a non-magnetic spin-photovoltaic polarimeter that directly converts polarization of light into transverse voltage signals.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

The complementary regime of blue-detuned pumping is investigated in this work using a single, trapped Mg<sup>+</sup> ion interacting with two laser beams, tuned above and below resonance. Widely thought of as a regime of heating, theory and experiment instead show that stimulated emission of centre-of-mass phonons occurs, providing saturable amplification of the motion. A threshold for transition from thermal to coherent oscillating motion has been observed, thus establishing this system as a mechanical analogue to an optical laser&#8212;a phonon laser.

article,Mimicking celestial mechanics in metamaterials,"<p>Einstein&#8217;s general theory of relativity establishes equality between matter&#8211;energy density and the curvature of spacetime. As a result, light and matter follow natural paths in the inherent spacetime and may experience bending and trapping in a specific region of space. So far, the interaction of light and matter with curved spacetime has been predominantly studied theoretically and through astronomical observations. Here, we propose to link the newly emerged field of artificial optical materials to that of celestial mechanics, thus opening the way to investigate light phenomena reminiscent of orbital motion, strange attractors and chaos, in a controlled laboratory environment. The optical&#8211;mechanical analogy enables direct studies of critical light/matter behaviour around massive celestial bodies and, on the other hand, points towards the design of novel optical cavities and photon traps for application in microscopic devices and lasers systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Dentcho A.

article,Turning solid aluminium transparent by intense soft X-ray photoionization,"<p>Saturable absorption is a phenomenon readily seen in the optical and infrared wavelengths. It has never been observed in core-electron transitions owing to the short lifetime of the excited states involved and the high intensities of the soft X-rays needed. We report saturable absorption of an L-shell transition in aluminium using record intensities over 10<sup>16</sup>&#8201;W&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> at a photon energy of 92&#8201;eV. From a consideration of the relevant timescales, we infer that immediately after the X-rays have passed, the sample is in an exotic state where all of the aluminium atoms have an L-shell hole, and the valence band has approximately a 9&#8201;eV temperature, whereas the atoms are still on their crystallographic positions. Subsequently, Auger decay heats the material to the warm dense matter regime, at around 25&#8201;eV temperatures. The method is an ideal candidate to study homogeneous warm dense matter, highly relevant to planetary science, astrophysics and inertial confinement fusion.</p>",[],False,"[""Bob Nagler"", ""Ulf Zastrau"", ""Roland R.

article,Single-drop fragmentation determines size distribution of raindrops,"<p>Like many natural objects, raindrops are distributed in size. By extension of what is known to occur inside the clouds, where small droplets grow by accretion of vapour and coalescence, raindrops in the falling rain at the ground level are believed to result from a complex mutual interaction with their neighbours. We show that the raindrops&#8217; polydispersity, generically represented according to Marshall&#8211;Palmer&#8217;s law (1948), is quantitatively understood from the fragmentation products of non-interacting, isolated drops. Both the shape of the drops&#8217; size distribution, and its parameters are related from first principles to the dynamics of a single drop deforming as it falls in air, ultimately breaking into a dispersion of smaller fragments containing the whole spectrum of sizes observed in rain. The topological change from a big drop into smaller stable fragments&#8212;the raindrops&#8212;is accomplished within a timescale much shorter than the typical collision time between the drops.</p>",[],False,"[""Emmanuel Villermaux"", ""Benjamin Bossa""]","Villermaux, E., Bossa, B.
