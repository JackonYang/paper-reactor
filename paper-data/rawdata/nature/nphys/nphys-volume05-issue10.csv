article,Non-local observables and lightcone-averaging in relativistic thermodynamics,"<p>The unification of relativity and thermodynamics has been a subject of considerable debate over the past 100&#8201;years. The reasons for this are twofold. First, thermodynamic variables are non-local quantities and therefore single out a preferred class of hyperplanes in spacetime. Second, there exist different ways of defining heat and work in relativistic systems and all of them seem equally plausible. These ambiguities have led, for example, to various proposals for the Lorentz-transformation law of temperature. However, traditional &#8216;isochronous&#8217; formulations of relativistic thermodynamics are neither theoretically satisfactory nor experimentally feasible. Here, we demonstrate how these deficiencies can be resolved by defining thermodynamic quantities with respect to the backward-lightcone of an observation event. This approach yields new predictions that are, in principle, testable and allows for a straightforward extension of thermodynamics to general relativity. Our theoretical considerations are illustrated through three-dimensional relativistic many-body simulations.</p>",[],False,"[""J\u00f6rn Dunkel"", ""Peter H\u00e4nggi"", ""Stefan Hilbert""]","Dunkel, J., Hänggi, P. & Hilbert, S.

article,Experimental four-qubit bound entanglement,"<p>Entanglement is one of the most puzzling features of quantum theory and of great importance for the new field of quantum information. Being a peculiar form of entanglement, bound entanglement emerges in certain mixed quantum states. This form of entanglement is not distillable by local operators and classical communication. Bound-entangled states are different from both the free entangled (distillable) and separable states. Here we report on the first experimental demonstration of a four-qubit polarization bound-entangled state, the so-called Smolin state. We have fully characterized its entanglement properties. Moreover, we have realized unlocking of the entanglement protocol for this state. The special properties of the Smolin state constitute a useful quantum resource for new multiparty communication schemes.</p>",[],False,"[""Elias Amselem"", ""Mohamed Bourennane""]","Amselem, E., Bourennane, M.

article,Antiferromagnetic criticality at a heavy-fermion quantum phase transition,"<p>The interpretation of the magnetic phase diagrams of strongly correlated electron systems remains controversial. In particular, the physics of quantum phase transitions, which occur at zero temperature, is still enigmatic. Heavy-fermion compounds are textbook examples of quantum criticality, as doping, or the application of pressure or a magnetic field can lead to a quantum phase transition between a magnetically ordered state and a paramagnetic regime. A central question concerns the microscopic nature of the critical quantum fluctuations. Are they antiferromagnetic or of local origin? Here we demonstrate, using inelastic neutron scattering experiments, that the quantum phase transition in the heavy-fermion system Ce<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>La<sub>x</sub>Ru<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> is controlled by fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic order parameter. At least for this heavy-fermion family, the Hertz&#8211;Millis&#8211;Moriya spin fluctuation approach seems to be a sound basis for describing the quantum antiferromagnetic&#8211;paramagnetic instability.</p>",[],False,"[""W.

article,Confluence of resonant laser excitation and bidirectional quantum-dot nuclear-spin polarization,"<p>Resonant laser scattering along with photon correlation measurements established the atom-like character of quantum dots. Here, we show that for a wide range of experimental parameters it is impossible to isolate elementary quantum-dot excitations from a strong influence of nuclear spins; the absorption lineshapes at magnetic fields exceeding 1&#8201;T indicate that the nuclear spins get polarized by an amount that ensures locking of the quantum-dot resonance to the incident laser frequency. In stark contrast to earlier experiments, this nuclear-spin polarization is bidirectional, allowing the combined electron&#8211;nuclear-spin system to track the changes in laser frequency dynamically on both sides of the resonance. This unexpected feature stems from a competition between two spin-pumping processes that attempt to polarize nuclear spins in opposite directions. We find that the confluence of laser excitation and nuclear-spin polarization suppresses the fluctuations in resonant absorption. A master-equation analysis suggests narrowing of the nuclear-spin distribution, pointing to applications in quantum information&#160;processing.</p>",[],False,"[""C. Latta"", ""A. H\u00f6gele"", ""Y.

article,Locking electron spins into magnetic resonance by electron–nuclear feedback,"<p>Quantum information processing requires accurate coherent control of quantum-mechanical two-level systems, but is hampered in practice by their coupling to an uncontrolled environment. For electron spins in III&#8211;V quantum dots, the random environment is mostly given by the nuclear spins in the quantum-dot host material; they collectively act on the electron spin through the hyperfine interaction, much like a random magnetic field. Here we show that the same hyperfine interaction can be harnessed such that partial control of the normally uncontrolled environment becomes possible. In particular, we observe that the electron-spin-resonance frequency remains locked to the frequency of an applied microwave magnetic field, even when the external magnetic field or the excitation frequency are changed. The nuclear field thereby adjusts itself such that the electron-spin-resonance condition remains satisfied. General theoretical arguments indicate that this spin-resonance locking might be accompanied by a significant reduction of the randomness in the nuclear field.</p>",[],False,"[""Ivo T.

article,Probing the microscopic flexibility of DNA from melting temperatures,"<p>The microscopic flexibility of DNA is a key ingredient for understanding its interaction with proteins and drugs but is still poorly understood and technically challenging to measure. Several experimental methods probe very long DNA samples, but these miss local flexibility details. Others mechanically disturb or modify short molecules and therefore do not obtain flexibility properties of unperturbed and pristine DNA. Here, we show that it is possible to extract very detailed flexibility information about unmodified DNA from melting temperatures with statistical physics models. We were able to retrieve, from published melting temperatures, several established flexibility properties such as the presence of highly flexible TATA regions of genomic DNA and support recent findings that DNA is very flexible at short length scales. New information about the nanoscale Na<sup>+</sup> concentration dependence of DNA flexibility was determined and we show the key role of ApT and TpA steps when it comes to ion-dependent flexibility and melting temperatures.</p>",[],False,"[""Gerald Weber"", ""Jonathan W.
