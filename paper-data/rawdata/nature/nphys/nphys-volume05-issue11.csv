article,Charge-4e superconductivity from pair-density-wave order in certain high-temperature superconductors,"<p>A number of spectacular experimental anomalies have been discovered recently in certain cuprates, notably La<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and La<sub>1.6&#8722;x</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, which show unidirectional spin and charge order (known as stripe order). We have recently proposed to interpret these observations as evidence for a new &#8216;striped&#8217; superconducting state, in which the superconducting order parameter is modulated in space, such that its average is precisely zero. Here, we show that thermal melting of the striped superconducting state can lead to a number of unusual phases, of which the most novel is a charge-4e superconducting state, with a corresponding fractional flux quantum h c=4e. These are never-before-observed states of matter, which, moreover, cannot arise from the conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer mechanism. Thus, direct confirmation of their existence, even in a small subset of the cuprates, could have much broader implications for our understanding of high-temperature superconductivity. We propose experiments to observe fractional flux quantization, which could confirm the existence of these&#160;states.</p>",[],False,"[""Erez Berg"", ""Eduardo Fradkin"", ""Steven A.

article,Topology-driven quantum phase transitions in time-reversal-invariant anyonic quantum liquids,"<p>Indistinguishable particles in two dimensions can be characterized by anyonic quantum statistics, which is more general than that of bosons or fermions. Anyons emerge as quasiparticles in fractional quantum Hall states and in certain frustrated quantum magnets. Quantum liquids of anyons show degenerate ground states, where the degeneracy depends on the topology of the underlying surface. Here, we present a new type of continuous quantum phase transition in such anyonic quantum liquids, which is driven by quantum fluctuations of the topology. The critical state connecting two anyonic liquids on surfaces with different topologies is reminiscent of the notion of a &#8216;quantum foam&#8217; with fluctuations on all length scales. This exotic quantum phase transition arises in a microscopic model of interacting anyons for which we present an exact solution in a linear geometry. We introduce an intuitive physical picture of this model that unifies string nets and loop gases, and provide a simple description of topological quantum phases and their phase transitions.</p>",[],False,"[""Charlotte Gils"", ""Simon Trebst"", ""Alexei Kitaev"", ""Andreas W.

article,Room-temperature ferromagnetism in graphite driven by two-dimensional networks of point defects,"<p>Understanding the mechanism of ferromagnetism in carbon-based materials, which contain only s and p electrons in contrast to traditional ferromagnets based on 3d or 4f electrons, is challenging. Here, we demonstrate direct evidence for ferromagnetic order locally at defect structures in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with magnetic force microscopy and in bulk magnetization measurements at room temperature. Magnetic impurities have been excluded as the origin of the magnetic signal. The observed ferromagnetism has been attributed to originate from localized electron states at grain boundaries of HOPG, forming two-dimensional arrays of point defects. The theoretical value of the magnetic ordering temperature based on weak interlayer coupling and/or magnetic anisotropy is comparable to the experimental value. The unusual chemical environment of defects bonded in graphitic networks can reveal the role of the s and p electrons, creating new routes for spin transport in carbon-based materials.</p>",[],False,"[""J. \u010cervenka"", ""M.

article,Emergent crystallinity and frustration with Bose–Einstein condensates in multimode cavities,"<p>We propose that condensed-matter phenomena involving the spontaneous emergence and dynamics of crystal lattices can be realized using Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates coupled to multimode optical cavities. It is known that, in the case of a transversely pumped single-mode cavity, the atoms crystallize at either the even or the odd antinodes of the cavity mode at sufficient pump laser intensity, thus spontaneously breaking a discrete translational symmetry. Here we demonstrate that, in multimode cavities, crystallization involves the spontaneous breaking of a continuous translational symmetry, through a variant of Brazovskii&#8217;s transition, thus paving the way for realizations of compliant lattices and associated phenomena, such as dislocations, frustration, glassiness and even supersolidity, in ultracold atomic settings, where quantum effects have a dominant role. We apply a functional-integral formalism to explore the role of fluctuations in this correlated many-body system, to calculate their effect on the threshold for ordering, and to determine their imprint on the correlations of the light emitted from the cavity.</p>",[],False,"[""Sarang Gopalakrishnan"", ""Benjamin L.
