article,Universal quantum control of two-electron spin quantum bits using dynamic nuclear polarization,"<p>One fundamental requirement for quantum computation is to carry out universal manipulations of quantum bits at rates much faster than the qubit&#8217;s rate of decoherence. Recently, fast gate operations have been demonstrated in logical spin qubits composed of two electron spins where the rapid exchange of the two electrons permits electrically controllable rotations around one axis of the qubit. However, universal control of the qubit requires arbitrary rotations around at least two axes. Here, we show that by subjecting each electron spin to a magnetic field of different magnitude, we achieve full quantum control of the two-electron logical spin qubit with nanosecond operation times. Using a single device, a magnetic-field gradient of several hundred millitesla is generated and sustained using dynamic nuclear polarization of the underlying Ga and As nuclei. Universal control of the two-electron qubit is then demonstrated using quantum state tomography. The presented technique provides the basis for single- and potentially multiple-qubit operations with gate times that approach the threshold required for quantum error correction.</p>",[],False,"[""Sandra Foletti"", ""Hendrik Bluhm"", ""Diana Mahalu"", ""Vladimir Umansky"", ""Amir Yacoby""]","Foletti, S., Bluhm, H., Mahalu, D. et al.

article,Near-field cavity optomechanics with nanomechanical oscillators,"<p>Cavity-enhanced radiation-pressure coupling between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom allows quantum-limited position measurements and gives rise to dynamical backaction, enabling amplification and cooling of mechanical motion. Here, we demonstrate purely dispersive coupling of high-Q nanomechanical oscillators to an ultrahigh-finesse optical microresonator via its evanescent field, extending cavity optomechanics to nanomechanical oscillators. Dynamical backaction mediated by the optical dipole force is observed, leading to laser-like coherent nanomechanical oscillations solely due to radiation pressure. Moreover, sub-fm&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> displacement sensitivity is achieved, with a measurement imprecision equal to the standard quantum limit (SQL), which coincides with the nanomechanical oscillator&#8217;s zero-point fluctuations. The achievement of an imprecision at the SQL and radiation-pressure dynamical backaction for nanomechanical oscillators may have implications not only for detecting quantum phenomena in mechanical systems, but also for a variety of other precision experiments. Owing to the flexibility of the near-field coupling platform, it can be readily extended to a diverse set of nanomechanical oscillators. In addition, the approach provides a route to experiments where radiation-pressure quantum backaction dominates at room temperature, enabling ponderomotive squeezing or quantum non-demolition measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""G.

article,Self-induced back-action optical trapping of dielectric nanoparticles,"<p>Optical trapping has widely affected both the physical and life sciences. Past approaches to optical trapping of nanoscale objects required large optical intensities, often above their damage threshold. To achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in the local intensity required for optical trapping, we present a self-induced back-action (SIBA) optical trap, where the trapped object has an active role in enhancing the restoring force. We demonstrate experimentally trapping of a single 50&#8201;nm polystyrene sphere using a SIBA optical trap on the basis of the transmission resonance of a nanoaperture in a metal film. SIBA optical trapping shows a striking departure from previous approaches, which we quantify by comprehensive calculations. The SIBA optical trap enables new opportunities for non-invasive immobilization of a single nanoscale object, such as a virus or a quantum dot.</p>",[],False,"[""Mathieu L.

article,Anisotropic magneto-Coulomb effects and magnetic single-electron-transistor action in a single nanoparticle,"<p>A present challenge in the field of spintronics is the study of spin-dependent transport in nanodevices where all dimensions are reduced to only a few nanometres. The archetypical device structure used to explore spin transport at such a scale consists of a nanometre-sized object such as a molecule, quantum dot or nanotube connected by ferromagnetic contacts. New magneto-Coulomb effects are expected as a consequence of the interaction between charge and spin degrees of freedom. However, the focus has been mainly theoretical up to now with a lack of results on the experimental side. More importantly, in most of the studies the influence of the ferromagnetic electrodes has been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that a significant magneto-Coulomb effect can be induced by conventional magnetic electrodes and mimic spin-valve magnetoresistance. Moreover, we show that the magnetic electrode can act as a gate leading to a ferromagnetic single-electron transistor with only two terminals.</p>",[],False,"[""Anne Bernand-Mantel"", ""Pierre Seneor"", ""Karim Bouzehouane"", ""St\u00e9phane Fusil"", ""Cyrile Deranlot"", ""Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Petroff"", ""Albert Fert""]","Bernand-Mantel, A., Seneor, P., Bouzehouane, K. et al.
