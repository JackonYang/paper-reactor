article,Quantum oscillations from Fermi arcs,"<p>When a metal is subjected to a strong magnetic field B, nearly all measurable quantities show oscillations periodic in 1/B. Such quantum oscillations represent a canonical probe of the defining aspect of a metal, its Fermi surface. Recent breakthrough experiments demonstrating the existence of unambiguous quantum oscillations in a cuprate superconductor, YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6.51</sub>, contradict the well-established result of many angle resolved photoemission studies, which consistently indicate &#8216;Fermi arcs&#8217;&#8212;truncated segments of a Fermi surface&#8212;in the normal state of the cuprates. In this study, with the goal of reconciling the above disagreement, we introduce a mechanism for quantum oscillations that requires only finite segments of a Fermi surface. We show that oscillations periodic in 1/B can occur if the Fermi surface segments are terminated by a pairing gap and present arguments that these oscillations are in fact occurring in the cuprates.</p>",[],False,"[""T.

article,Confinement of fractional quantum number particles in a condensed-matter system,"<p>The concept of confinement states that in certain systems the constituent particles are bound together by an interaction for which the strength increases with increasing particle separation. One of the consequences of this is that these individual particles cannot be observed directly. The most famous example of confinement is found in particle physics where baryons and mesons are produced by the confinement of quarks. However, similar phenomena can occur in condensed-matter physics systems such as spin ladders that consist of two spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic chains coupled together by spin exchange interactions. Excitations of individual chains (spinons) carrying spin S=1/2, are confined by even an infinitesimal interchain coupling. Most ladders studied so far cannot illustrate this process because the large strength of their interchain coupling suppresses the spinon excitations at all energy scales. Here we present neutron scattering experiments for a weakly coupled ladder material. At high energies the behaviour of this system approaches that of individual chains, but at low energies it is dominated by the integral spin excitations of strongly coupled chains.</p>",[],False,"[""Bella Lake"", ""Alexei M.

article,Probing superfluids in optical lattices by momentum-resolved Bragg spectroscopy,"<p>The fundamental concept of superfluidity gives rise to fascinating effects and collective behaviour such as vortex creation and second sound. Using quantum gases in optical lattices, superfluids can be realized over a wide range of tunable parameters, with a continuous connection to the regime of strong correlation. However, for full experimental access and a comprehensive comparison with condensed-matter systems, there is a need for new detection techniques to probe their essential physics. Here we report on a comprehensive study of superfluids in optical lattices by Bragg spectroscopy. We present fully momentum-resolved measurements of the band structure and associated interaction effects at several lattice depths. In addition, we directly study the composition of excitations and observe strong indications for Bogoliubov backscattering. Our measurements demonstrate the applicability and limits of the Bogoliubov theory to describe excitation properties of superfluids in periodic potentials and should pave the way for detailed studies of strongly correlated phases.</p>",[],False,"[""Philipp T.

article,A universal origin for secondary relaxations in supercooled liquids and structural glasses,"<p>Supercooled liquids and glasses show a range of relaxation times. Nearly all glass-forming liquids show secondary relaxations, high-frequency dynamical modes of structural reconfiguration seemingly distinct from the primary alpha relaxations. We show that accounting for driving-force fluctuations and the diversity of reconfiguring shapes in the random first-order transition theory yields a new dynamical process that shares many of the features ascribed to secondary relaxations. Whereas primary relaxation takes place through activated events involving compact regions, secondary relaxation is governed by more ramified, string-like or percolation-like clusters of particles. These secondary relaxations generate a low free-energy tail on the distribution of activation barriers, which becomes more prominent with increasing temperature. The activation barrier distributions of the two processes merge near the dynamical-crossover temperature T<sub>c</sub>, where the secondary process ultimately becomes the dominant mode of structural relaxation. These string-like reconfigurations are seen to smooth the transition at T<sub>c</sub> between high-temperature collisional dynamics and activated events.</p>",[],False,"[""Jacob D.

article,Controlling X-rays with light,"<p>Ultrafast X-ray science is an exciting frontier that promises the visualization of electronic, atomic and molecular dynamics on atomic time and length scales. A largely unexplored area of ultrafast X-ray science is the use of light to control how X-rays interact with matter. To extend control concepts established for long-wavelength probes to the X-ray regime, the optical control field must drive a coherent electronic response on a timescale comparable to femtosecond core-hole lifetimes. An intense field is required to achieve this rapid response. Here, an intense optical control pulse is observed to efficiently modulate photoelectric absorption for X-rays and to create an ultrafast transparency window. We demonstrate an application of X-ray transparency relevant to ultrafast X-ray sources: an all-photonic temporal cross-correlation measurement of a femtosecond X-ray pulse. The ability to control X-ray&#8211;matter interactions with light will create new opportunities for present and next-generation X-ray light sources.</p>",[],False,"[""T. E. Glover"", ""M. P.
