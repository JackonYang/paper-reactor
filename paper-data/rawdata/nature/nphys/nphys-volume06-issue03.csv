article,Attosecond imaging of molecular electronic wavepackets,"<p>A strong laser field may tunnel ionize a molecule from several orbitals simultaneously, forming an attosecond electron&#8211;hole wavepacket. Both temporal and spatial information on this wavepacket can be obtained through the coherent soft X-ray emission resulting from the laser-driven recollision of the liberated electron with the core. By characterizing the emission from aligned N<sub>2</sub> molecules, we demonstrate the attosecond contributions of the two highest occupied molecular orbitals. We determine conditions where they are disentangled in the real and imaginary parts of the emission dipole moment. This allows us to carry out a tomographic reconstruction of both orbitals with angstrom spatial resolution. Their coherent superposition provides experimental images of the attosecond wavepacket created in the ionization process. Our results open the prospect of imaging ultrafast intramolecular dynamics combining attosecond and angstrom resolutions.</p>",[],False,"[""S. Haessler"", ""J. Caillat"", ""W. Boutu"", ""C.

article,Turbulent inward pinch of plasma confined by a levitated dipole magnet,"<p>The rearrangement of plasma as a result of turbulence is among the most important processes that occur in planetary magnetospheres and in experiments used for fusion energy research. Remarkably, fluctuations that occur in active magnetospheres drive particles inward and create centrally peaked profiles. Until now, the strong peaking seen in space has been undetectable in the laboratory because the loss of particles along the magnetic field is faster than the net driven flow across the magnetic field. Here, we report the first laboratory measurements in which a strong superconducting magnet is levitated and used to confine high-temperature plasma in a configuration that resembles planetary magnetospheres. Levitation eliminates field-aligned particle loss, and the central plasma density increases markedly. The build-up of density characterizes a sustained turbulent pinch and is equal to the rate predicted from measured electric-field fluctuations. Our observations show that dynamic principles describing magnetospheric plasma are relevant to plasma confined by a levitated dipole.</p>",[],False,"[""A. C. Boxer"", ""R. Bergmann"", ""J. L.

article,Back-action-evading measurements of nanomechanical motion,"<p>When carrying out ultrasensitive continuous measurements of position, one must ultimately confront the fundamental effects of detection back-action. Back-action forces set a lower bound on the uncertainty in the measured position, the &#8216;standard quantum limit&#8217; (SQL). Recent measurements of nano- and micromechanical resonators are rapidly approaching this limit. Making measurements with sensitivities surpassing the SQL will require a new kind of approach: back-action-evading (BAE), quantum non-demolition measurement techniques. Here we realize a BAE measurement based on the parametric coupling between a nanomechanical and a microwave resonator. We demonstrate for the first time BAE detection of a single quadrature of motion with sensitivity four times the quantum zero-point motion of the mechanical resonator. We identify a limiting parametric instability inherent in BAE measurement, and describe how to improve the technique to surpass the SQL and permit the formation of squeezed states of motion.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Static control logic for microfluidic devices using pressure-gain valves,"<p>Microfluidic technology has developed greatly in recent years, enabling multiple analysis systems to be placed on a microfluidic chip. However, microfluidic large-scale integration of control elements analogous to those achieved in the microelectronics industry is still a challenge. We present an integrated microfluidic valve, compatible with standard soft-lithography processes, which has a pressure gain much greater than unity. We show that this enables integration of fully static digital control logic and state storage directly on-chip, ultimately enabling microfluidic-state machines to be designed. Outputs from this digital control logic can then be used to control traditional analyte flow valves. This strategy enables much of the bulky external hardware at present used to control pneumatically driven microfluidic chips in the laboratory to be transferred onto the microfluidic chip, which drastically reduces the required number of external chip connections.</p>",[],False,"[""James A.

article,Self-organized adaptation of a simple neural circuit enables complex robot behaviour,"<p>Controlling sensori-motor systems in higher animals or complex robots is a challenging combinatorial problem, because many sensory signals need to be simultaneously coordinated into a broad behavioural spectrum. To rapidly interact with the environment, this control needs to be fast and adaptive. Present robotic solutions operate with limited autonomy and are mostly restricted to few behavioural patterns. Here we introduce chaos control as a new strategy to generate complex behaviour of an autonomous robot. In the presented system, 18 sensors drive 18 motors by means of a simple neural control circuit, thereby generating 11 basic behavioural patterns (for example, orienting, taxis, self-protection and various gaits) and their combinations. The control signal quickly and reversibly adapts to new situations and also enables learning and synaptic long-term storage of behaviourally useful motor responses. Thus, such neural control provides a powerful yet simple way to self-organize versatile behaviours in autonomous agents with many degrees of freedom.</p>",[],False,"[""Silke Steingrube"", ""Marc Timme"", ""Florentin W\u00f6rg\u00f6tter"", ""Poramate Manoonpong""]","Steingrube, S., Timme, M., Wörgötter, F. et al.
