article,Dynamical axion field in topological magnetic insulators,"<p>Axions are weakly interacting particles of low mass, and were postulated more than 30&#8201;years ago in the framework of the Standard Model of particle physics. Their existence could explain the missing dark matter of the Universe. However, despite intensive searches, axions have yet to be observed. Here we show that magnetic fluctuations of topological insulators couple to the electromagnetic fields exactly like the axions, and propose several experiments to detect this dynamical axion field. In particular, we show that the axion coupling enables a nonlinear modulation of the electromagnetic field, leading to attenuated total reflection. We propose a new optical-modulator device based on this principle.</p>",[],False,"[""Rundong Li"", ""Jing Wang"", ""Xiao-Liang Qi"", ""Shou-Cheng Zhang""]","Li, R., Wang, J., Qi, XL. et al.

article,Two-orbital S U(N) magnetism with ultracold alkaline-earth atoms,"<p>Fermionic alkaline-earth atoms have unique properties that make them attractive candidates for the realization of atomic clocks and degenerate quantum gases. At the same time, they are attracting considerable theoretical attention in the context of quantum information processing. Here we demonstrate that when such atoms are loaded in optical lattices, they can be used as quantum simulators of unique many-body phenomena. In particular, we show that the decoupling of the nuclear spin from the electronic angular momentum can be used to implement many-body systems with an unprecedented degree of symmetry, characterized by the S U(N) group with N as large as 10. Moreover, the interplay of the nuclear spin with the electronic degree of freedom provided by a stable optically excited state should enable the study of physics governed by the spin&#8211;orbital interaction. Such systems may provide valuable insights into the physics of strongly correlated transition-metal oxides, heavy-fermion materials and spin-liquid phases.</p>",[],False,"[""A. V. Gorshkov"", ""M.

article,Analog information processing at the quantum limit with a Josephson ring modulator,"<p>Amplifiers are crucial in every experiment carrying out a very sensitive measurement. However, they always degrade the information by adding noise. Quantum mechanics puts a limit on how small this degradation can be. Theoretically, the minimum noise energy added by a phase-preserving amplifier to the signal it processes amounts at least to half a photon at the signal frequency. Here we propose a practical microwave device that can fulfil the minimal requirements to reach the quantum limit. The availability of such a device is of importance for the readout of solid-state qubits, and more generally for the measurement of very weak signals in various areas of science. We discuss how this device can be the basic building block for a variety of practical applications, such as amplification, noiseless frequency conversion, dynamic cooling and production of entangled signal pairs.</p>",[],False,"[""N.

article,Naturally occurring resonators in random lasing of π-conjugated polymer films,"<p>Random lasing consists of a sequence of narrow, coherent spectral lines formed when stimulated emission in a disordered gain medium is excited above threshold excitation intensity, I<sub>th</sub>. We studied the I<sub>th</sub> distribution function in &#960;-conjugated polymer films, and its dependence on the excitation area size and polymer mixture with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles; optical pictures of the excited film area support the statistical measurements. At I<sub>th</sub> we found that a single dominant random lasing resonator appears in the picture, with good agreement between its diameter and the cavity size extracted from the power Fourier transform analysis of the emission spectrum. This was directly confirmed by a new technique of space/spectrum cross-correlation of the laser emission lines from the excited area with 10&#215;10&#8201;&#956;m<sup>2</sup> spatial resolution. The statistical results coupled with the imaging data provide strong evidence for the model of random resonators in the gain medium for explaining random lasing in &#960;-conjugated polymer&#160;films.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Exploring laser-wakefield-accelerator regimes for near-term lasers using particle-in-cell simulation in Lorentz-boosted frames,"<p>Plasma-based acceleration offers compact accelerators with potential applications for high-energy physics and photon sources. The past five years have seen an explosion of experimental results with monoenergetic electron beams up to 1&#8201;GeV on a centimetre-scale, using plasma waves driven by intense lasers. The next decade will see tremendous increases in laser power and energy, permitting beam energies beyond 10&#8201;GeV. Leveraging on the Lorentz transformations to bring the laser and plasma spatial scales together, we have reduced the computational time for modelling laser&#8211;plasma accelerators by several orders of magnitude, including all the relevant physics. This scheme enables the first one-to-one particle-in-cell simulations of the next generation of accelerators at the energy frontier. Our results demonstrate that, for a given laser energy, choices in laser and plasma parameters strongly affect the output electron beam energy, charge and quality, and that all of these parameters can be&#160;optimized.</p>",[],False,"[""S.
