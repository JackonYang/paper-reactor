article,Why do particle clouds generate electric charges?,"<p>Grains in desert sandstorms spontaneously generate strong electrical charges; likewise volcanic dust plumes produce spectacular lightning displays. Charged particle clouds also cause devastating explosions in food, drug and coal processing industries. Despite the wide-ranging importance of granular charging in both nature and industry, even the simplest aspects of its causes remain elusive, because it is difficult to understand how inert grains in contact with little more than other inert grains can generate the large charges observed. Here, we present a simple yet predictive explanation for the charging of granular materials in collisional flows. We argue from very basic considerations that charge transfer can be expected in collisions of identical dielectric grains in the presence of an electric field, and we confirm the model&#8217;s predictions using discrete-element simulations and a tabletop granular experiment.</p>",[],False,"[""T.

article,Massively parallel computing on an organic molecular layer,"<p>Modern computers operate at enormous speeds&#8212;capable of executing in excess of 10<sup>13</sup> instructions per second&#8212;but their sequential approach to processing, by which logical operations are performed one after another, has remained unchanged since the 1950s. In contrast, although individual neurons of the human brain fire at around just 10<sup>3</sup> times per second, the simultaneous collective action of millions of neurons enables them to complete certain tasks more efficiently than even the fastest supercomputer. Here we demonstrate an assembly of molecular switches that simultaneously interact to perform a variety of computational tasks including conventional digital logic, calculating Voronoi diagrams, and simulating natural phenomena such as heat diffusion and cancer growth. As well as representing a conceptual shift from serial-processing with static architectures, our parallel, dynamically reconfigurable approach could provide a means to solve otherwise intractable computational problems.</p>",[],False,"[""Anirban Bandyopadhyay"", ""Ranjit Pati"", ""Satyajit Sahu"", ""Ferdinand Peper"", ""Daisuke Fujita""]","Bandyopadhyay, A., Pati, R., Sahu, S. et al.

article,Mott physics and band topology in materials with strong spin–orbit interaction,"<p>Recent theory and experiment have revealed that strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling can have marked qualitative effects on the band structure of weakly interacting solids, leading to a distinct phase of matter, the topological band insulator. We show that spin&#8211;orbit interaction also has quantitative and qualitative effects on the correlation-driven Mott insulator transition. Taking Ir-based pyrochlores as a specific example, we predict that for weak electron&#8211;electron interaction Ir electrons are in metallic and topological band insulator phases at weak and strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction, respectively. We show that by increasing the electron&#8211;electron interaction strength, the effects of spin&#8211;orbit coupling are enhanced. With increasing interactions, the topological band insulator is transformed into a &#8216;topological Mott insulator&#8217; phase having gapless surface spin-only excitations. The proposed phase diagram also includes a region of gapless Mott insulator with a spinon Fermi surface, and a magnetically ordered state at still larger electron&#8211;electron interaction.</p>",[],False,"[""Dmytro Pesin"", ""Leon Balents""]","Pesin, D., Balents, L.

article,A Rydberg quantum simulator,"<p>A universal quantum simulator is a controlled quantum device that reproduces the dynamics of any other many-particle quantum system with short-range interactions. This dynamics can refer to both coherent Hamiltonian and dissipative open-system evolution. Here we propose that laser-excited Rydberg atoms in large-spacing optical or magnetic lattices provide an efficient implementation of a universal quantum simulator for spin models involving n-body interactions, including such of higher order. This would allow the simulation of Hamiltonians of exotic spin models involving n-particle constraints, such as the Kitaev toric code, colour code and lattice gauge theories with spin-liquid phases. In addition, our approach provides the ingredients for dissipative preparation of entangled states based on engineering n-particle reservoir couplings. The basic building blocks of our architecture are efficient and high-fidelity n-qubit entangling gates using auxiliary Rydberg atoms, including a possible dissipative time step through optical pumping. This enables mimicking the time evolution of the system by a sequence of fast, parallel and high-fidelity n-particle coherent and dissipative Rydberg gates.</p>",[],False,"[""Hendrik Weimer"", ""Markus M\u00fcller"", ""Igor Lesanovsky"", ""Peter Zoller"", ""Hans Peter B\u00fcchler""]","Weimer, H., Müller, M., Lesanovsky, I. et al.A Rydberg quantum simulator.

article,Interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in crystalline nanowires,"<p>The interaction between superconductivity and ferromagnetism, which entails incompatible spin order, is one of the problems of fundamental interest in condensed-matter physics. In general, when a ferromagnet is placed in contact with a superconductor, the Cooper pairs from the superconductor are not expected to survive beyond at most a few nanometres into the ferromagnet. Here we present a systematic study of single-crystal ferromagnetic cobalt nanowires sandwiched between superconducting electrodes. Surprisingly, we find that a cobalt wire as long as 600&#8201;nm attains zero resistance at low temperatures. For even longer nanowires, the transition to incomplete superconductivity is foreshadowed by a strikingly large and sharp resistance peak near the superconducting transition temperature of the electrodes.&#160;Although the origin of the &#8216;critical peak&#8217; remains mysterious, our analysis strongly points against charge or spin imbalance as its underlying cause.</p>",[],False,"[""Jian Wang"", ""Meenakshi Singh"", ""Mingliang Tian"", ""Nitesh Kumar"", ""Bangzhi Liu"", ""Chuntai Shi"", ""J.
