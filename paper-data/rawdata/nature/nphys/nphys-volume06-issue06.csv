article,Experimental violation of a Bell's inequality in time with weak measurement,"<p>The violation of Bell inequalities with two entangled and spatially separated quantum two-level systems (TLSs) is often considered as the most prominent demonstration that nature does not obey local realism. Under different but related assumptions of macrorealism&#8212;which macroscopic systems plausibly fulfil&#8212;Leggett and Garg derived a similar inequality for a single degree of freedom undergoing coherent oscillations and being measured at successive times. Here, we test such a &#8216;Bell&#8217;s inequality in time&#8217;, which should be violated by a quantum TLS. Our TLS is a superconducting quantum circuit in which Rabi oscillations are continuously driven while it is continuously and weakly measured. The time correlations present at the detector output agree with quantum-mechanical predictions and violate the Leggett&#8211;Garg inequality by five standard deviations.</p>",[],False,"[""Agustin Palacios-Laloy"", ""Fran\u00e7ois Mallet"", ""Fran\u00e7ois Nguyen"", ""Patrice Bertet"", ""Denis Vion"", ""Daniel Esteve"", ""Alexander N.

article,Evidence for the ballistic intrinsic spin Hall effect in HgTe nanostructures,"<p>In the spin Hall effect, a current passed through a spin&#8211;orbit coupled electron gas induces a spin accumulation of inverse sign on either side of the sample. A number of possible mechanisms have been described, extrinsic as well as intrinsic ones, and they may occur in the ballistic as well as the diffusive transport regime. A central problem for experimentalists in studying the effect is the very small signals that result from the spin accumulation. Electrical measurements on metals have yielded reliable signatures of the spin Hall effect, but in semiconductors the spin accumulation could only be detected by optical techniques. Here we report experimental evidence for electrical manipulation and detection of the ballistic intrinsic spin Hall effect (ISHE) in semiconductors. We perform a non-local electrical measurement in nanoscale H-shaped structures built on high-mobility HgTe/(Hg, Cd)Te quantum wells. When the samples are tuned into the p-regime, we observe a large non-local resistance signal due to the ISHE, several orders of magnitude larger than in metals. In the n-regime, where the spin&#8211;orbit splitting is reduced, the signal is at least one order of magnitude smaller and vanishes for narrower quantum wells. We verify our experimental observations by quantum transport calculations.</p>",[],False,"[""C. Br\u00fcne"", ""A. Roth"", ""E. G. Novik"", ""M. K\u00f6nig"", ""H. Buhmann"", ""E. M.

article,Laser-driven amplification of soft X-rays by parametric stimulated emission in neutral gases,"<p>We present a new method for parametric amplification of soft-X-ray radiation. The laser-driven amplifier is based on parametric stimulated emission and is seeded with high-order-harmonic radiation generated in the same medium. The exponential increase of the soft-X-ray yield with increasing atomic density is experimentally demonstrated for two different sets of laser parameters. A small-signal gain up to 8&#215;10<sup>3</sup> is obtained in both experiments at about 40&#8201;eV in argon using 350-fs-long laser pulses and with 6-fs-long ones at about 260&#8201;eV in helium, respectively. This new scheme reduces the pumping threshold for lasing with a comparable conversion efficiency into the millijoule level, which is about two orders of magnitude smaller compared with the conventional plasma X-ray lasers. With a simple model, we can estimate the necessary experimental conditions for identifying the spectral range and the magnitude of the maximum gain, which are in reasonable agreement with our measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Quantum entanglement in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes,"<p>Light-harvesting components of photosynthetic organisms are complex, coupled, many-body quantum systems, in which electronic coherence has recently been shown to survive for relatively long timescales, despite the decohering effects of their environments. Here, we analyse entanglement in multichromophoric light-harvesting complexes, and establish methods for quantification of entanglement by describing necessary and sufficient conditions for entanglement and by deriving a measure of global entanglement. These methods are then applied to the Fenna&#8211;Matthews&#8211;Olson protein to extract the initial state and temperature dependencies of entanglement. We show that, although the Fenna&#8211;Matthews&#8211;Olson protein in natural conditions largely contains bipartite entanglement between dimerized chromophores, a small amount of long-range and multipartite entanglement should exist even at physiological temperatures. This constitutes the first rigorous quantification of entanglement in a biological system. Finally, we discuss the practical use of entanglement in densely packed molecular aggregates such as light-harvesting complexes.</p>",[],False,"[""Mohan Sarovar"", ""Akihito Ishizaki"", ""Graham R.

article,Optimal matrix rigidity for stress-fibre polarization in stem cells,"<p>The shape and differentiated state of many cell types are highly sensitive to the rigidity of the microenvironment. The physical mechanisms involved, however, are unknown. Here, we present a theoretical model and experiments demonstrating that the alignment of stress fibres within stem cells is a non-monotonic function of matrix rigidity. We treat the cell as an active elastic inclusion in a surrounding matrix, allowing the actomyosin forces to polarize in response to elastic stresses developed in the cell. The theory correctly predicts the monotonic increase of the cellular forces with the matrix rigidity and the alignment of stress fibres parallel to the long axis of cells. We show that the anisotropy of this alignment depends non-monotonically on matrix rigidity and demonstrate it experimentally by quantifying the orientational distribution of stress fibres in stem cells. These findings offer physical insight into the sensitivity of stem-cell differentiation to tissue elasticity and, more generally, introduce a cell-type-specific parameter for actomyosin polarizability.</p>",[],False,"[""A.
