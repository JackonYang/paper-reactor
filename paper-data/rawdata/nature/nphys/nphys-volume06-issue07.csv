article,Detecting the orientation of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters,"<p>Clusters of galaxies, filled with hot magnetized plasma, are the largest bound objects in existence and an important touchstone in understanding the formation of structures in our Universe. In such clusters, thermal conduction follows field lines, so magnetic fields strongly shape the cluster&#8217;s thermal history; that some have not since cooled and collapsed is a mystery. In a seemingly unrelated puzzle, recent observations of Virgo cluster spiral galaxies imply ridges of strong, coherent magnetic fields offset from their centre. Here we demonstrate, using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations, that such ridges are easily explained by galaxies sweeping up field lines as they orbit inside the cluster. This magnetic drape is then lit up with cosmic rays from the galaxies&#8217; stars, generating coherent polarized emission at the galaxies&#8217; leading edges. This immediately presents a technique for probing local orientations and characteristic length scales of cluster magnetic fields. The first application of this technique, mapping the field of the Virgo cluster, gives a startling result: outside a central region, the magnetic field is preferentially oriented radially as predicted by the magnetothermal instability. Our results strongly suggest a mechanism for maintaining some clusters in a &#8216;non-cooling-core&#8217;&#160;state.</p>",[],False,"[""Christoph Pfrommer"", ""Jonathan Dursi""]","Pfrommer, C., Dursi, J.

article,Persistent currents and quantized vortices in a polariton superfluid,"<p>After the discovery of zero viscosity in liquid helium, other fundamental properties of the superfluidity phenomenon have been revealed. One of them, irrotational flow, gives rise to quantized vortices and persistent currents. Those are the landmarks of superfluidity in its modern understanding. Recently, a new variety of dissipationless fluid behaviour has been found in microcavities under the optical parametric regime. Here we report the observation of metastable persistent polariton superflows sustaining a quantized angular momentum, m, after applying a 2-ps laser pulse carrying a vortex state. We observe a transfer of angular momentum to the steady-state condensate, which sustains vorticity for as long as it can be tracked. Furthermore, we study the stability of quantized vortices with m=2. The experiments are analysed using a generalized two-component Gross&#8211;Pitaevskii equation. These results demonstrate the control of metastable persistent currents and show the peculiar superfluid character of non-equilibrium polariton condensates.</p>",[],False,"[""D. Sanvitto"", ""F. M.

article,Many-body exciton states in self-assembled quantum dots coupled to a Fermi sea,"<p>Many-body interactions give rise to fascinating physics such as the X-ray Fermi-edge singularity in metals, the Kondo effect in the resistance of metals with magnetic impurities and the fractional quantum Hall effect. Here we report the observation of striking many-body effects in the optical spectra of a semiconductor quantum dot interacting with a degenerate electron gas. A semiconductor quantum dot is an artificial atom, the properties of which can be controlled by means of a tunnel coupling between a metallic contact and the quantum dot. Previous studies concern mostly the regime of weak tunnel coupling, whereas here we investigate the regime of strong coupling, which markedly modifies the optical spectra. In particular we observe two many-body exciton states: Mahan and hybrid excitons. These experimental results open the route towards the observation of a tunable Kondo effect in excited states of semiconductors and are of importance for the technological implementation of quantum dots in devices for quantum information processing.</p>",[],False,"[""N.

article,Quantum random networks,"<p>Quantum mechanics offers new possibilities to process and transmit information. In recent years, algorithms and cryptographic protocols exploiting the superposition principle and the existence of entangled states have been designed. They should allow us to realize communication and computational tasks that outperform any classical strategy. Here we show that quantum mechanics also provides fresh perspectives in the field of random networks. Already the simplest model of a classical random graph changes markedly when extended to the quantum case, where we obtain a distinct behaviour of the critical probabilities at which different subgraphs appear. In particular, in a network of N nodes, any quantum subgraph can be generated by local operations and classical communication if the entanglement between pairs of nodes scales as N<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. This result also opens up new vistas in the domain of quantum networks and their applications.</p>",[],False,"[""S. Perseguers"", ""M. Lewenstein"", ""A. Ac\u00edn"", ""J. I.

article,Turing patterns in network-organized activator–inhibitor systems,"<p>Turing instability in activator&#8211;inhibitor systems provides a paradigm of non-equilibrium self-organization; it has been extensively investigated for biological and chemical processes. Turing instability should also be possible in networks, and general mathematical methods for its treatment have been formulated previously. However, only examples of regular lattices and small networks were explicitly considered. Here we study Turing patterns in large random networks, which reveal striking differences from the classical behaviour. The initial linear instability leads to spontaneous differentiation of the network nodes into activator-rich and activator-poor groups. The emerging Turing patterns become furthermore strongly reshaped at the subsequent nonlinear stage. Multiple coexisting stationary states and hysteresis effects are observed. This peculiar behaviour can be understood in the framework of a mean-field theory. Our results offer a new perspective on self-organization phenomena in systems organized as complex networks. Potential applications include ecological metapopulations, synthetic ecosystems, cellular networks of early biological morphogenesis, and networks of coupled chemical nanoreactors.</p>",[],False,"[""Hiroya Nakao"", ""Alexander S.
