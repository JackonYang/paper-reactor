article,A quantum spin transducer based on nanoelectromechanical resonator arrays,"<p>Isolated electronic and nuclear spins in solids are at present being actively explored for potential quantum-computing applications. Spin degrees of freedom provide an excellent quantum memory, owing to their weak magnetic interactions with the environment. For the same reason, however, it is difficult to achieve controlled interactions of spins over distances larger than tens of nanometres. Here we propose a new realization of a quantum data bus for spin qubits where spins are coupled to the motion of magnetized mechanical resonators through magnetic-field gradients. Provided that the mechanical system is charged, the magnetic moments associated with spin qubits can be effectively amplified to enable a coherent spin&#8211;spin coupling over long distances through Coulomb forces. Our approach is applicable to a wide class of electronic spin qubits, which can be localized near magnetized tips and can be used for the implementation of hybrid quantum-computing architectures.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

article,How grain boundaries limit supercurrents in high-temperature superconductors,"<p>The interface properties of high-temperature (high-T<sub>c</sub>) copper oxide superconductors have been of interest for many years, and play an essential role in Josephson junctions, superconducting cables and microwave electronics. In particular, the maximum critical current achievable in high-T<sub>c</sub> wires and tapes is well known to be limited by the presence of grain boundaries, regions of mismatch between crystallites with misoriented crystalline axes. Studies of single artificially fabricated grain boundaries have revealed that the critical current J<sub>c</sub> of a grain boundary junction depends exponentially on the misorientation angle. Until now microscopic understanding of this apparently universal behaviour has been lacking. We present here the results of a microscopic evaluation based on a construction of fully three-dimensional YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7&#8722;&#948;</sub> grain boundaries using molecular dynamics. With these structures, we calculate an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian for the d-wave superconductor with a grain boundary. The critical current is then shown to follow an exponential suppression with grain boundary angle &#945;. We identify the build-up of charge inhomogeneities as the dominant mechanism for the suppression of the supercurrent.</p>",[],False,"[""S. Graser"", ""P. J. Hirschfeld"", ""T. Kopp"", ""R.

article,Unravelling the role of the interface for spin injection into organic semiconductors,"<p>Organic materials are attractive for building spintronics devices owing to their expected long spin lifetimes. Moreover, the ability to control their properties by changing their composition and molecular structure makes them easier to tailor to given tasks than inorganic materials. However, most studies of candidate organic spintronics materials focus on their bulk spin transport characteristics. Here we investigate the equally important process of spin injection and how it is influenced by interface coupling in the prototype organic semiconductor, Alq<sub>3</sub>. We fabricate nanometre-scale (La,Sr)MnO<sub>3</sub>/Alq<sub>3</sub>/Co magnetic tunnel junctions that exhibit a magnetoresistive response of up to 300%. Furthermore, we develop a spin transport model that describes the role of interfacial spin-dependent metal/molecule hybridization on the effective polarization allowing enhancement and even sign reversal of injected spins. We expect such insights to lead towards the molecular-level engineering of metal/organic interfaces to tailor spin injection and bring new electrical functionalities to spintronics devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Cl\u00e9ment Barraud"", ""Pierre Seneor"", ""Richard Mattana"", ""St\u00e9phane Fusil"", ""Karim Bouzehouane"", ""Cyrile Deranlot"", ""Patrizio Graziosi"", ""Luis Hueso"", ""Ilaria Bergenti"", ""Valentin Dediu"", ""Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Petroff"", ""Albert Fert""]","Barraud, C., Seneor, P., Mattana, R. et al.

article,Transference of transport anisotropy to composite fermions,"<p>When interacting two-dimensional electrons are placed in a large perpendicular magnetic field, to minimize their energy, they capture an even number of flux quanta and create new particles called composite fermions (CFs). These complex electron-flux-bound states offer an elegant explanation for the fractional quantum Hall effect. Furthermore, thanks to the flux attachment, the effective field vanishes at a half-filled Landau level and CFs exhibit Fermi-liquid-like properties, similar to their zero-field electron counterparts. However, being solely influenced by interactions, CFs should possess no memory whatever of the electron parameters. Here we address a fundamental question. Does an anisotropy of the electron effective mass and Fermi surface survive composite fermionization? We measure the resistance of CFs in AlAs quantum wells where electrons occupy an elliptical Fermi surface with large eccentricity and anisotropic effective mass. Similar to their electron counterparts, CFs also exhibit anisotropic transport, suggesting an anisotropy of CF effective mass and Fermi surface.</p>",[],False,"[""T.

article,Formation of beads-on-a-string structures during break-up of viscoelastic filaments,"<p>Break-up of viscoelastic filaments is pervasive in both nature and technology. If a filament is formed by placing a drop of saliva between a thumb and forefinger and is stretched, the filament&#8217;s morphology close to break-up corresponds to beads of several sizes interconnected by slender threads. Although there is general agreement that formation of such beads-on-a-string (BOAS) structures occurs only for viscoelastic fluids, the underlying physics remains unclear and controversial. The physics leading to the formation of BOAS structures is probed by numerical simulation. Computations reveal that viscoelasticity alone does not give rise to a small, satellite bead between two much larger main beads but that inertia is required for its formation. Viscoelasticity, however, enhances the growth of the bead and delays pinch-off, which leads to a relatively long-lived beaded structure. We also show for the first time theoretically that yet smaller, sub-satellite beads can also form as seen&#160;in&#160;experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Pradeep P.
