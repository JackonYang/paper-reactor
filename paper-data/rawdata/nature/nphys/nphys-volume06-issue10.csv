review article,Physical virology,"<p>Viruses are nanosized, genome-filled protein containers with remarkable thermodynamic and mechanical properties. They form by spontaneous self-assembly inside the crowded, heterogeneous cytoplasm of infected cells. Self-assembly of viruses seems to obey the principles of thermodynamically reversible self-assembly but assembled shells (&#8216;capsids&#8217;) strongly resist disassembly. Following assembly, some viral shells pass through a sequence of coordinated maturation steps that progressively strengthen the capsid. Nanoindentation measurements by atomic force microscopy enable tests of the strength of individual viral capsids. They show that concepts borrowed from macroscopic materials science are surprisingly relevant to viral shells. For example, viral shells exhibit &#8216;materials fatigue&#8217; and the theory of thin-shell elasticity can account &#8212;&#160;in part &#8212;&#160;for atomic-force-microscopy-measured force&#8211;deformation curves. Viral shells have effective Young&#8217;s moduli ranging from that of polyethylene to that of plexiglas. Some of them can withstand internal osmotic pressures that are tens of atmospheres. Comparisons with thin-shell theory also shed light on nonlinear irreversible processes such as plastic deformation and failure. Finally, atomic force microscopy experiments can quantify the mechanical effects of genome encapsidation and capsid protein mutations on viral shells, providing virological insight and suggesting new biotechnological applications.</p>",[],False,"[""W.

review article,Emergent complex neural dynamics,"<p>A large repertoire of spatiotemporal activity patterns in the brain is the basis for adaptive behaviour. Understanding the mechanism by which the brain&#8217;s hundred billion neurons and hundred trillion synapses manage to produce such a range of cortical configurations in a flexible manner remains a fundamental problem in neuroscience. One plausible solution is the involvement of universal mechanisms of emergent complex phenomena evident in dynamical systems poised near a critical point of a second-order phase transition. We review recent theoretical and empirical results supporting the notion that the brain is naturally poised near criticality, as well as its implications for better understanding of the brain.</p>",[],False,"[""Dante R.

review article,Challenges in protein-folding simulations,"<p>Experimental studies of protein folding are hampered by the fact that only low-resolution structural data can be obtained with sufficient temporal resolution. Molecular dynamics simulations offer a complementary approach, providing extremely high-resolution spatial and temporal data on folding processes. However, at present, such simulations are limited in several respects, including the inability of molecular dynamics force fields to completely reproduce the true potential energy surfaces of proteins, the need for simulations to extend to the millisecond timescale for the folding of many proteins and the difficulty inherent in obtaining sufficient sampling to properly characterize the extremely heterogeneous folding processes and then analysing those data efficiently. We review recent progress in the simulation of three common model systems for protein folding, and discuss how advances in technology and theory are allowing protein-folding simulations to address their present&#160;shortcomings.</p>",[],False,"[""Peter L.

article,Quantum critical states and phase transitions in the presence of non-equilibrium noise,"<p>Quantum critical points are characterized by scale-invariant correlations and therefore by long-range entanglement. As such, they present fascinating examples of quantum states of matter and their study is an important theme in modern physics. However, little is known about the fate of quantum criticality under non-equilibrium conditions. Here we investigate the effect of external noise sources on quantum critical points. It is natural to expect that noise will have a similar effect to finite temperature, that is, destroying the subtle correlations underlying the quantum critical behaviour. Surprisingly, we find that the ubiquitous 1/f noise does preserve the critical correlations. The emergent states show an intriguing interplay of intrinsic quantum critical and external-noise-driven fluctuations. We illustrate this general phenomenon with specific examples describing solid-state and ultracold-atoms systems. Moreover, our approach shows that genuine quantum phase transitions can exist even under non-equilibrium conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Emanuele G.

article,Real-space mapping of magnetically quantized graphene states,"<p>The symmetry of graphene&#8217;s two carbon sublattices underlies its unique electronic structure and half-integer quantum Hall effect. Quantized Hall resistance requires confinement of cyclotron orbits (Landau levels) in the sample interior. Such magnetic localization may be unique in graphene, especially for the fourfold-degenerate Landau level (LL<sub>0</sub>) straddling graphene&#8217;s charge-neutrality energy. Here we map the two-dimensional spatial distribution of LL<sub>0</sub>, using cryogenic scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to measure the local density of states (LDOS) on electronically decoupled multilayer epitaxial graphene. Unlike disordered LDOS patterns found in conventional quantum Hall systems, we find an organized pattern of localized states and extended states that emerge above a threshold magnetic field. In distinct regions, an energy gap associated with lattice-scale variations of the LDOS suggests the sublattice (and LL<sub>0</sub> valley) degeneracy is locally lifted. We propose this occurs when cyclotron orbits become small enough to sample regions of small symmetry-breaking potential originating from a graphene-on-graphene moir&#233;.</p>",[],False,"[""David L.

article,Modelling the scaling properties of human mobility,"<p>Individual human trajectories are characterized by fat-tailed distributions of jump sizes and waiting times, suggesting the relevance of continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) models for human mobility. However, human traces are barely random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modelling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile-phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws, but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.</p>",[],False,"[""Chaoming Song"", ""Tal Koren"", ""Pu Wang"", ""Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si""]","Song, C., Koren, T., Wang, P. et al.
