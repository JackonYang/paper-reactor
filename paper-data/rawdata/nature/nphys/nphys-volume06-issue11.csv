article,A quantum memory with telecom-wavelength conversion,"<p>In a fibre-based quantum information network, telecom-wavelength transmission between quantum memory elements is required to minimize absorption. Owing to the paucity of suitable ground-state atomic transitions, a quantum memory interfaced with telecom light has not been previously realized. We report its demonstration by converting to telecom wavelength near-infrared light emitted on a ground-state transition. The conversion is achieved with a diamond configuration of atomic transitions, in an optically thick gas of cold rubidium. The quantum memory is also realized with cold rubidium, but confined in an optical lattice to suppress motional dephasing on a submillisecond timescale. We observe quantum memory lifetimes in excess of 0.1&#8201;s by laser compensation of the lattice light shifts that limited the previous generation of atomic memory to 7&#8201;ms. By measuring quantum correlations of light fields before and after telecom down-conversion, transmission and up-conversion, we demonstrate a basic memory element for a scalable, long-distance quantum network.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,A finite-temperature phase transition for disordered weakly interacting bosons in one dimension,"<p>It is commonly accepted that there are no phase transitions in one-dimensional systems at a finite temperature, because long-range correlations are destroyed by thermal fluctuations. Here we show theoretically that the one-dimensional gas of short-range interacting bosons in the presence of disorder can undergo a finite-temperature phase transition between two distinct states: fluid and insulator. Neither of these states has long-range spatial correlations, but this is a true, albeit non-conventional, phase transition, because transport properties are singular at the transition point. In the fluid phase, mass transport is possible, whereas in the insulator phase it is completely blocked even at finite temperatures. This study thus provides insight into how the interaction between disordered bosons influences their Anderson localization. This question, first raised for electrons in solids, is now crucial for the studies of atomic bosons, where recent experiments have demonstrated Anderson localization in expanding dilute quasi-one-dimensional clouds.</p>",[],False,"[""I.

article,Loss of nodal quasiparticle integrity in underdoped YBa2Cu3O6+x,"<p>A central question in the study of high-temperature superconductivity is whether this phenomenon is linked to the doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator or whether it emerges from a Fermi-liquid state across the whole cuprate phase diagram. Discriminating between these orthogonal cases hinges on the quantitative determination of the elusive quasiparticle strength Z as a function of hole-doping p, from the heavily overdoped to the deeply underdoped regime. Here we show, by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and an in situ doping technique, that the electronic structure of the overdoped metal (0.24&#8804;p&#8804;0.37) is in remarkable agreement with density functional theory and Fermi-liquid-like descriptions. However, below p&#8776;0.10&#8211;0.15, we observe the loss of nodal quasiparticle integrity. This marks a clear departure from Fermi-liquid behaviour and a more rapid than expected crossover to Mott physics, indicating that the physical properties of underdoped cuprates are dominated by incoherent excitations.</p>",[],False,"[""D.

article,Far-field optical imaging and manipulation of individual spins with nanoscale resolution,"<p>A fundamental limit to existing optical techniques for measurementand manipulation of spin degrees of freedom is set by diffraction, which does not allow spins separated by less than about a quarter of a micrometre to be resolved using conventional far-field optics. Here, we report an efficient far-field optical technique that overcomes the limiting role of diffraction, allowing individual electronic spins to be detected, imaged and manipulated coherently with nanoscale resolution. The technique involves selective flipping of the orientation of individual spins, associated with nitrogen-vacancy centres in room-temperature diamond, using a focused beam of light with intensity vanishing at a controllable location, which enables simultaneous single-spin imaging and magnetometry at the nanoscale with considerably less power than conventional techniques. Furthermore, by inhibiting spin transitions away from the laser intensity null, selective coherent rotation of individual spins is realized. This technique can be extended to subnanometre dimensions, thus enabling applications in diverse areas ranging from quantum information science to bioimaging.</p>",[],False,"[""P. C. Maurer"", ""J.

article,Trionic optical potential for electrons in semiconductors,"<p>Laser-induced optical potentials for atoms have led to remarkable advances in precision measurement, quantum information and towards addressing fundamental questions in condensed-matter physics. Here, we describe analogous optical potentials for electrons in quantum wells and wires that can be generated by optically driving the transition between a single electron and a three-body electron&#8211;exciton bound state, known as a trion. The existence of a bound trion state adds a term to the a.c. Stark shift of the material proportional to the light intensity at the position of the electron. According to our theoretical calculations, this shift can be large relative to the thermal equilibrium temperature of the electron, resulting in a relatively strong optical potential that could be used to trap, guide and manipulate individual electrons within a semiconductor quantum well or wire. These potentials can be thought of as artificial nanostructures on the scale of 100&#8201;nm that can be spin dependent and reconfigurable in real time. Our results suggest the possibility of integrating ultrafast optics and gate voltages in new resolved-carrier semiconductor optoelectronic devices, with potential applications in fields such as nanoelectronics, spintronics and quantum information processing.</p>",[],False,"[""Martin J.
