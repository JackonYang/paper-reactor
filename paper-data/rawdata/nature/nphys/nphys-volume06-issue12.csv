article,Accessing the dark exciton with light,"<p>The fundamental optical excitation in semiconductors is an electron&#8211;hole pair with antiparallel spins: the &#8216;bright&#8217; exciton. Bright excitons in optically active, direct-bandgap semiconductors and their nanostructures have been thoroughly studied. In quantum dots, bright excitons provide an essential interface between light and the spins of interacting confined charge carriers. Recently, complete control of the spin state of single electrons and holes in these nanostructures has been demonstrated, a necessary step towards quantum information processing with these two-level systems. In principle, the bright exciton&#8217;s spin could also be used directly as a two-level system. However, because of its short radiative lifetime, its usefulness is limited. An electron&#8211;hole pair with parallel spins forms a long-lived, optically inactive &#8216;dark exciton&#8217;, and has received less attention as it is mostly regarded as an inaccessible excitation. In this work we demonstrate that the dark exciton forms a coherent two-level system that can fairly easily be accessed by external light. We demonstrate: optical preparation of its spin state as a coherent superposition of two eigenstates, coherent precession of its spin state at a frequency defined by the energy difference between its eigenstates, and readout of the spin by charge addition and subsequent polarized photon detection.</p>",[],False,"[""E.

article,Suppression of the critical temperature for superfluidity near the Mott transition,"<p>Ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices have proven to be a controllable, tunable and clean implementation of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. An essential prospect for such quantum simulators is their ability to map out the phase diagram of fundamental many-body model Hamiltonians. However, the results need to be validated first for representative benchmark problems through state-of-the-art numerical methods of quantum many-body theory. Here we present the first ab initio comparison between experiments and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for strongly interacting Bose gases on a lattice for large systems (up to  particles). The comparison enables thermometry for the interacting quantum gas and to experimentally determine the finite-temperature phase diagram for bosonic superfluids in an optical lattice, revealing a suppression of the critical temperature as the transition to the Mott insulator is approached.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

article,Nonlinear optical effects in trapping nanoparticles with femtosecond pulses,"<p>The optical trapping technique has been widely used in various areas to manipulate particles, cells, and so forth. The principle of trapping is based on the interaction between optical electric fields and induced linear polarizations. Here we show a novel phenomenon of trapping arising from nonlinear polarization when we trap gold nanoparticles by ultrashort near-infrared laser pulses. That is, the stable trap site is split into two equivalent positions (we call this &#8216;trap split&#8217;). The trap positions are aligned along the direction of the incident laser polarization. The dependencies of trap split on the trapping-laser power and wavelength were investigated. The results were successfully interpreted in terms of the nonlinear polarization caused by the femtosecond pulses. This method may give novel applications to micromachining, nanofabrication, and biological samples as well as atomic and molecular trapping at low temperatures.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuqiang Jiang"", ""Tetsuya Narushima"", ""Hiromi Okamoto""]","Jiang, Y., Narushima, T. & Okamoto, H.

article,High-power laser delocalization in plasmas leading to long-range beam merging,"<p>Attraction and fusion between co-propagating light beams, mutually coherent or not, can take place in nonlinear media as a result of the beam power modifying the refractive index of the medium. In the context of high-power light beams, induced modifications of the beam patterns could potentially impact many topics, including long-range laser propagation, the study of astrophysical colliding blast waves and inertial confinement fusion. Here, through experiments and simulations, we show that in a fully ionized plasma, which is a nonlinear medium, beam merging can take place for high-power and mutually incoherent beams that are initially separated by several beam diameters. This is in contrast to the usual assumption that this type of interaction is limited to beams separated by only one beam diameter. This effect, which is orders of magnitude more significant than Kerr-like nonlinearity in gases, demonstrates the importance of potential cross-talk amongst multiple beams in plasma.</p>",[],False,"[""M.
