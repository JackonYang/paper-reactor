article,Many-body Landau–Zener dynamics in coupled one-dimensional Bose liquids,"<p>The Landau&#8211;Zener model of a quantum mechanical two-level system driven with a linearly time-dependent detuning has served over decades as a textbook model of quantum dynamics. In their seminal work, Landau and Zener derived a non-perturbative prediction for the transition probability between two states, which often serves as a reference point for the analysis of more complex systems. A particularly intriguing question is whether that framework can be extended to describe many-body quantum dynamics. Here we report an experimental and theoretical study of a system of ultracold atoms, offering a direct many-body generalization of the Landau&#8211;Zener problem. In a system of pairwise tunnel-coupled one-dimensional (1D) Bose liquids we show how tuning the correlations of the 1D gases and the tunnel coupling between the tubes strongly modify the original Landau&#8211;Zener picture. The results are explained using a mean-field description of the inter-tube condensate wavefunction, coupled to the low-energy phonons of the 1D Bose liquid.</p>",[],False,"[""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Sebastian D.

article,Real-space observation of emergent magnetic monopoles and associated Dirac strings in artificial kagome spin ice,"<p>Magnetic monopoles have been predicted to occur as emergent fractional quasiparticles inside pyrochlore spin ice, a frustrated magnetic insulator. Experimental signatures of such emergent monopoles accompanied by Dirac strings have been detected by means of neutron scattering in reciprocal space in pyrochlore spin ice at sub-Kelvin temperatures, but their real-space observation has remained elusive. Here we report on direct, real-space observations of emergent monopoles and their associated Dirac strings in two-dimensional (2D) artificial kagome spin ice at room temperature using synchrotron X-ray photoemission electron microscopy. Magnetization reversal proceeds through the nucleation and avalanche-type dissociation of monopole&#8211;antimonopole pairs along 1D Dirac strings. This is in sharp contrast to conventional domain growth in 2D systems, providing a striking example of dimensional reduction due to frustration. The observed hysteresis, monopole densities and 1D Dirac-string avalanches are quantitatively explained by Monte Carlo simulations.</p>",[],False,"[""Elena Mengotti"", ""Laura J.

article,Thermal ground-state ordering and elementary excitations in artificial magnetic square ice,"<p>Recent advances in nanotechnology allow model systems to be constructed, in which frustrated interactions can be tuned at will, such as artificial spin ice. The symmetry of the square ice lattice leads to the emergence of a long-range-ordered ground state from the manifold of frustrated states. However, it is experimentally very difficult to access using the effective thermodynamics of rotating-field demagnetization protocols, because the energy barriers to thermal equilibrium are extremely large. Here we study an as-fabricated sample that approaches the ground state very closely. We identify the small localized departures from the ground state as elementary excitations of the system, at frequencies that follow a Boltzmann law. We therefore identify the state we observe as the frozen-in residue of true thermodynamics that occurred during the fabrication of the sample. The relative proportions of different excitations are suggestive of monopole interactions during thermalization.</p>",[],False,"[""Jason P.

article,Built-in and induced polarization across LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterojunctions,"<p>Ionic crystals terminated at oppositely charged polar surfaces are inherently unstable and expected to undergo surface reconstructions to maintain electrostatic stability. Essentially, an electric field that arises between oppositely charged atomic planes gives rise to a built-in potential that diverges with thickness. Here we present evidence of such a built-in potential across polar LaAlO<sub>3</sub>&#160;thin films grown on SrTiO<sub>3</sub>&#160;substrates, a system well known for the electron gas that forms at the interface. By carrying out tunnelling measurements between the electron gas and metallic electrodes on LaAlO<sub>3</sub>&#160;we measure a built-in electric field across LaAlO<sub>3</sub>&#160;of 80.1&#160;meV&#8201;&#197;<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. In addition, capacitance measurements reveal the presence of an induced dipole moment across the heterostructure. We foresee use of the ionic built-in potential as an additional tuning parameter in both existing and future device architectures, especially as atomic control of oxide interfaces gains widespread momentum.</p>",[],False,"[""Guneeta Singh-Bhalla"", ""Christopher Bell"", ""Jayakanth Ravichandran"", ""Wolter Siemons"", ""Yasuyuki Hikita"", ""Sayeef Salahuddin"", ""Arthur F.

article,Simulations of efficient Raman amplification into the multipetawatt regime,"<p>Contemporary high-power laser systems make use of solid-state laser technology to reach petawatt pulse powers. The breakdown threshold for optical components in these systems, however, demands metre-scale beams. Raman amplification of laser beams promises a breakthrough by the use of much smaller amplifying media, that is, millimetre-diameter plasmas, but so far only 60&#8201;GW peak powers have been obtained in the laboratory, far short of the desired multipetawatt regime. Here we show, through the first large-scale multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations of this process, that multipetawatt peak powers can be reached, but only in a narrow parameter window dictated by the growth of plasma instabilities. Raman amplification promises reduced cost and complexity of intense lasers, enabling much greater access to higher-intensity regimes for scientific and industrial applications. Furthermore, we show that this process scales to short wavelengths, enabling compression of X-ray free-electron laser pulses to attosecond duration.</p>",[],False,"[""R. M. G. M. Trines"", ""F.
