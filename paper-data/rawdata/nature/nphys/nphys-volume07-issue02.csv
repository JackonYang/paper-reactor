article,Evidence for orbital superfluidity in the P-band of a bipartite optical square lattice,"<p>The successful emulation of the Hubbard model in optical lattices has stimulated extensive efforts to extend their scope to also capture more complex, incompletely understood scenarios of many-body physics. A promising approach is to consider higher bands, where the orbital degree of freedom gives rise to a structural diversity that is directly relevant, for example, for the physics of strongly correlated electronic matter. Here we report evidence for the formation of a superfluid in the P-band of a bipartite optical square lattice with S-orbits and P-orbits arranged in a chequerboard pattern. The observed momentum spectra feature cross-dimensional coherence with a lifetime of nearly 20&#8201;ms. Depending on the value of a small adjustable anisotropy of the lattice, our findings are explained either by real-valued striped superfluid order parameters with different orientations P<sub>x</sub>&#177;P<sub>y</sub>, or by a complex-valued P<sub>x</sub>&#177;i P<sub>y</sub> order parameter, which breaks time-reversal symmetry.</p>",[],False,"[""Georg Wirth"", ""Matthias \u00d6lschl\u00e4ger"", ""Andreas Hemmerich""]","Wirth, G., Ölschläger, M. & Hemmerich, A.

article,Antibunching of microwave-frequency photons observed in correlation measurements using linear detectors,"<p>At optical frequencies the radiation produced by a source, such as a laser, a black body or a single-photon emitter, is frequently characterized by analysing the temporal correlations of emitted photons using single-photon counters. At microwave frequencies, however, there are no efficient single-photon counters yet. Instead, well-developed linear amplifiers allow for efficient measurement of the amplitude of an electromagnetic field. Here, we demonstrate first- and second-order correlation function measurements of a pulsed microwave-frequency single-photon source integrated on the same chip with a 50/50 beam splitter followed by linear amplifiers and quadrature amplitude detectors. We clearly observe single-photon coherence in first-order and photon antibunching in second-order correlation function measurements of the propagating fields.</p>",[],False,"[""D. Bozyigit"", ""C.

article,Strong interactions of single atoms and photons near a dielectric boundary,"<p>Cavity quantum electrodynamics provides the setting for quantum control of strong interactions between a single atom and one photon. Many such atom&#8211;cavity systems interacting by coherent exchanges of single photons could be the basis for scalable quantum networks. However, moving beyond current proof-of-principle experiments involving just one or two conventional optical cavities requires the localization of individual atoms at distances &#8818;100&#8201;nm from a resonator&#8217;s surface. In this regime an atom can be strongly coupled to a single intracavity photon while at the same time experiencing significant radiative interactions with the dielectric boundaries of the resonator. Here, we report using real-time detection and high-bandwidth feedback to select and monitor single caesium atoms located &#8764;100&#8201;nm from the surface of a microtoroidal optical resonator. Strong radiative interactions of atom and cavity field probe atomic motion through the evanescent field of the resonator and reveal both the significant role of Casimir&#8211;Polder attraction and the manifestly quantum nature of the atom&#8211;cavity dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""D.

article,A 1.8-THz quantum cascade laser operating significantly above the temperature of ℏω/kB,"<p>Several competing technologies continue to advance the field of terahertz science; of particular importance has been the development of a terahertz semiconductor quantum cascade laser (QCL), which is arguably the only solid-state terahertz source with average optical power levels of much greater than a milliwatt. Terahertz QCLs are required to be cryogenically cooled and improvement of their temperature performance is the single most important research goal in the field. Thus far, their maximum operating temperature has been empirically limited to &#8764;&#8463;&#969;/k<sub>B</sub>, a largely inexplicable trend that has bred speculation that a room-temperature terahertz QCL may not be possible in materials used at present. Here, we argue that this behaviour is an indirect consequence of the resonant-tunnelling injection mechanism employed in all previously reported terahertz QCLs. We demonstrate a new scattering-assisted injection scheme to surpass this limit for a 1.8-THz QCL that operates up to &#8764;1.9&#8463;&#969;/k<sub>B</sub> (163&#8201;K). Peak optical power in excess of 2&#8201;mW was detected from the laser at 155&#8201;K. This development should make QCL technology attractive for applications below 2&#8201;THz, and initiate new design strategies for realizing a room-temperature terahertz semiconductor laser.</p>",[],False,"[""Sushil Kumar"", ""Chun Wang I.

article,Femtosecond coherence and quantum control of single molecules at room temperature,"<p>Quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as electronic coherence and entanglement, play a key role in several remarkably efficient natural processes including ultrafast electronic energy transfer and charge separation in photosynthetic light-harvesting. To gain insight into such dynamic processes of biomolecules it is vital to reveal relations between structural and quantum-mechanical properties. However, ensemble experiments targeting ultrafast coherences are hampered by the large intrinsic heterogeneity in these systems at physiological conditions, and single-molecule techniques have not been available until now. Here we show, by employing femtosecond pulse-shaping techniques, that quantum coherences in single organic molecules can be created, probed and manipulated at ambient conditions even in highly disordered solid environments. We find broadly distributed coherence decay times for different individual molecules giving direct insight into the structural heterogeneity of the local surroundings. Most importantly, we induce Rabi oscillations and control the coherent superposition state in a single molecule, thus carrying out a basic femtosecond single-qubit operation at room temperature.</p>",[],False,"[""Richard Hildner"", ""Daan Brinks"", ""Niek F. van Hulst""]","Hildner, R., Brinks, D. & van Hulst, N.

article,Glass transition with decreasing correlation length during cooling of Fe50Co50 superlattice and strong liquids,"<p>The glass transition is usually understood as a structural arrest that occurs during the cooling of liquids, trapping the system before it can crystallize. It occurs for all liquid classes, including metals. Theoretical interest has focused on the dynamical heterogeneity encountered during supercooling of &#8216;fragile&#8217; liquids. Many suggest that the slow-down is caused by increasing dynamical correlation lengths. Here we report kinetics and thermodynamics of arrest in a system that disorders while in its ground state, exhibits a large heat capacity change (&#916;C<sub>p</sub>=C<sub>p,mobile</sub>&#8722;C<sub>p,arrested</sub>) on arrest, yet clearly is characterized by a static correlation length that decreases when approaching the transition temperature T<sub>g</sub> from above. We show that our system, the Fe<sub>50</sub>Co<sub>50</sub> superlattice, kinetically mimics an ideal &#8216;strong&#8217; liquid with a critical point. Introducing liquid critical-point simulations, we can then argue that strong liquids differ from fragile liquids by occupying opposite flanks of an underlying order&#8211;disorder transition, which can be continuous, critical or weakly first order.</p>",[],False,"[""Shuai Wei"", ""Isabella Gallino"", ""Ralf Busch"", ""C.
