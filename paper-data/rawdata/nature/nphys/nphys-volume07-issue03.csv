article,Ultrafast optical control of entanglement between two quantum-dot spins,"<p>The interaction between two quantum bits enables the creation of entanglement, the two-particle correlations that are at the heart of quantum information science. In semiconductor quantum dots, much work has focused on demonstrating control over single spin qubits using optical techniques. However, optical control of two spin qubits remains a major challenge for scaling to a fully fledged quantum-information platform. Here, we combine advances in vertically stacked quantum dots with ultrafast laser techniques to achieve optical control of the entangled state of two electron spins. Each electron is in a separate InAs quantum dot, and the spins interact through tunnelling, where the tunnelling rate determines how rapidly entangling operations can be carried out. We achieve two-qubit gates with an interaction rate of 30&#8201;GHz, more than an order of magnitude faster than demonstrated in any other system so far. These results demonstrate the viability and advantages of optically controlled quantum-dot spins for multi-qubit systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Danny Kim"", ""Samuel G.

article,Observation of the thermal Casimir force,"<p>Quantum theory predicts the existence of the Casimir force between macroscopic bodies, a force arising from the zero-point energy of electromagnetic field modes around them. A thermal Casimir force, due to thermal rather than quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field at finite temperature, was theoretically predicted long ago. Here we report the experimental observation of the thermal Casimir force between two gold plates. We measured the attractive force between a flat and a spherical plate for separations between 0.7&#8201;&#956;m and 7&#8201;&#956;m. An electrostatic force caused by potential patches on the plates&#8217; surfaces is included in the analysis. Previous measurements of the quantum-fluctuation-induced force have been unable to clearly settle the question of whether the correct low-frequency form of the dielectric constant dispersion for calculating Casimir forces is the Drude model or the plasma model. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement (reduced &#967;<sup>2</sup> of 1.04) with the Casimir force calculated using the Drude model, including the T=300&#8201;K thermal force, which dominates over the quantum fluctuation-induced force at separations greater than 3&#8201;&#956;m.

article,Angle dependence of quantum oscillations in YBa2Cu3O6.59 shows free-spin behaviour of quasiparticles,"<p>Measurements of quantum oscillations in the cuprate superconductors afford an opportunity to assess the extent to which their electronic properties yield to a description rooted in Fermi-liquid theory. However, such an analysis is hampered by the small number of oscillatory periods observed in the accessible magnetic field range. Here we employ a genetic algorithm to globally model the field, angular and temperature dependence of the quantum oscillations observed in the resistivity of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6.59</sub>. This approach successfully fits an entire data set to a Fermi surface consisting of two small, quasi-two-dimensional cylinders, rather than the large Fermi surface predicted by conventional electronic-structure calculations. A key result is the first identification of the effects of Zeeman splitting, indicating that the quasiparticles behave as nearly free spins, constraining the source of the Fermi-surface reconstruction to something other than a spin-density wave with moments perpendicular to the magnetic field.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

article,Localization of preformed Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors,"<p>The most profound effect of disorder on electronic systems is the localization of the electrons transforming an otherwise metallic system into an insulator. If the metal is also a superconductor then, at low temperatures, disorder can induce a pronounced transition from a superconducting into an insulating state. An outstanding question is whether the route to insulating behaviour proceeds through the direct localization of Cooper pairs or, alternatively, by a two-step process in which the Cooper pairing is first destroyed followed by the standard localization of single electrons. Here we address this question by studying the local superconducting gap of a highly disordered amorphous superconductor by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Our measurements reveal that, in the vicinity of the superconductor&#8211;insulator transition, the coherence peaks in the one-particle density of states disappear whereas the superconducting gap remains intact, indicating the presence of localized Cooper pairs. Our results provide the first direct evidence that the superconductor&#8211;insulator transition in some homogeneously disordered materials is driven by Cooper-pair localization.</p>",[],False,"[""Benjamin Sac\u00e9p\u00e9"", ""Thomas Dubouchet"", ""Claude Chapelier"", ""Marc Sanquer"", ""Maoz Ovadia"", ""Dan Shahar"", ""Mikhail Feigel\u2019man"", ""Lev Ioffe""]","Sacépé, B., Dubouchet, T., Chapelier, C. et al.

article,Evolution of microscopic localization in graphene in a magnetic field from scattering resonances to quantum dots,"<p>Graphene exhibits rich new physics and great promise for applications in electronics. The half-integer quantum Hall effect and high carrier mobility are critically dependent on interactions with impurities/substrates and localization of Dirac fermions in realistic devices. We microscopically study these interactions using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) of exfoliated graphene on a SiO<sub>2</sub> substrate in an applied magnetic field. The magnetic field strongly affects the electronic behaviour of the graphene; the states condense into well-defined Landau levels with a dramatic change in the character of localization. In zero magnetic field, weakly localized states are created by the substrate induced disorder potential. In strong magnetic fields, the two-dimensional electron gas breaks into a network of interacting quantum dots formed at the potential hills and valleys of the disorder potential. Our results demonstrate how graphene properties are perturbed by the disorder potential; a finding essential for the physics and applications of graphene.</p>",[],False,"[""Suyong Jung"", ""Gregory M.

article,Creation and measurement of long-lived magnetic monopole currents in spin ice,"<p>The recent discovery of &#8216;magnetricity&#8217; in spin ice raises the question of whether long-lived currents of magnetic &#8216;monopoles&#8217; can be created and manipulated by applying magnetic fields. Here we show that they can. By applying a magnetic-field pulse to a Dy<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> spin-ice crystal at 0.36&#8201;K, we create a relaxing magnetic current that lasts for several minutes. We measure the current by means of the electromotive force it induces in a solenoid coupled to a sensitive amplifier, and quantitatively describe it using a chemical kinetic model of point-like charges obeying the Onsager&#8211;Wien mechanism of carrier dissociation and recombination. We thus derive the microscopic parameters of monopole motion in spin ice and identify the distinct roles of free and bound magnetic charges.

article,Excitable particles in an optical torque wrench,"<p>The optical torque wrench is a laser trapping technique capable of applying and directly measuring torque on microscopic birefringent particles using spin momentum transfer, and has found application in the measurement of static torsional properties of biological molecules such as single DNAs. Motivated by the potential of the optical torque wrench to access the fast rotational dynamics of biological systems, a result of its all-optical manipulation and detection, we focus on the angular dynamics of the trapped birefringent particle, demonstrating its excitability in the vicinity of a critical point. This links the optical torque wrench to nonlinear dynamical systems such as neuronal and cardiovascular tissues, nonlinear optics and chemical reactions, all of which display an excitable binary (&#8216;all-or-none&#8217;) response to input perturbations. On the basis of this dynamical feature, we devise and implement a conceptually new sensing technique capable of detecting single perturbation events with high signal-to-noise ratio and continuously adjustable sensitivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Francesco Pedaci"", ""Zhuangxiong Huang"", ""Maarten van Oene"", ""Stephane Barland"", ""Nynke H.

article,Impact of single links in competitive percolation,"<p>How a complex network is connected crucially impacts its dynamics and function. Percolation, the transition to extensive connectedness on gradual addition of links, was long believed to be continuous, but recent numerical evidence of &#8216;explosive percolation&#8217; suggests that it might also be discontinuous if links compete for addition. Here we analyse the microscopic mechanisms underlying discontinuous percolation processes and reveal a strong impact of single-link additions. We show that in generic competitive percolation processes, including those showing explosive percolation, single links do not induce a discontinuous gap in the largest cluster size in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, our results highlight that for large finite systems single links may still induce substantial gaps, because gap sizes scale weakly algebraically with system size. Several essentially macroscopic clusters coexist immediately before the transition, announcing discontinuous percolation. These results explain how single links may drastically change macroscopic connectivity in networks where links add competitively.</p>",[],False,"[""Jan Nagler"", ""Anna Levina"", ""Marc Timme""]","Nagler, J., Levina, A. & Timme, M.
