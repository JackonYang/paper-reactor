article,Observation of ordered vortices with Andreev bound states in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2,"<p>For a type-II superconductor in an applied magnetic field greater than the lower critical field H<sub>c1</sub>, the magnetic flux will penetrate into the superconductor and form quantized vortices with Andreev bound states in the vortex cores. The characteristics of the bound states are related to the pairing symmetry and band structure of the superconductor. Recently, a new family of high temperature (high-T<sub>c</sub>) superconductors, the iron pnictides, has been discovered. Surprisingly, in electron-doped Ba(Fe<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>Co<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub>, no bound state was found in the vortices. Here, we use a low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscope to study the electronic structure of hole-doped Ba<sub>0.6</sub>K<sub>0.4</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub>. Two superconducting gaps (with gap values 2&#916;/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>c</sub>&#8776;2.2 and 5.1, where k<sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann&#8217;s constant) were observed in the superconducting state. By applying magnetic fields, we observed ordered vortices with Andreev bound states in the vortex cores. The bound states and their spatial evolution can be qualitatively explained by our numerical calculations for multiband s-wave superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Lei Shan"", ""Yong-Lei Wang"", ""Bing Shen"", ""Bin Zeng"", ""Yan Huang"", ""Ang Li"", ""Da Wang"", ""Huan Yang"", ""Cong Ren"", ""Qiang-Hua Wang"", ""Shuheng H.

article,Heat capacity through the magnetic-field-induced resistive transition in an underdoped high-temperature superconductor,"<p>The underlying physics of the magnetic-field induced resistive state in lightly doped high-temperature cuprate superconductorsremains a mystery. One interpretation is that the application of magnetic field destroys the d-wave superconducting gap, uncovering a Fermi surface that behaves as a Fermi liquid. Another view is that an applied magnetic field destroys long-range superconducting phase coherence, but the superconducting gap amplitude survives. By measuring the specific heat of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6.56</sub> we determine the quasiparticle density of states from the superconducting state well into the magnetic-field induced resistive state. At very high magnetic fields the specific heat exhibits both the conventional temperature dependence and quantum oscillations expected for a Fermi liquid. On the other hand, the magnetic-field dependence of the quasiparticle density of states follows  behaviour that persists smoothly through the zero-resistance transition, giving evidence of a developed d-wave superconducting gap over the entire magnetic field range measured.</p>",[],False,"[""Scott C.

article,Random telegraph photosignals in a microwave-exposed two-dimensional electron system,"<p>The magneto-resistance of high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems exposed to microwaves exhibits radiation-induced oscillations with some minima approaching zero within experimental accuracy. Consensus has been reached that they originate from disorder-assisted indirect optical transitions and a non-equilibrium population of the electronic states. Both mechanisms capture the hall-marks of the observed oscillations except for the appearance of zero resistance. Theory has predicted that in the minima the resistivity can become negative. Then a homogeneous system turns unstable and current domains with large internal Hall electric fields pointing in opposite directions spontaneously form to produce zero resistance. Direct evidence for such domains has remained elusive. Here we introduce time as an unexplored parameter. Probing internal Hall voltages reveals random telegraph signals in the zero-resistance regime. They provide compelling evidence for spontaneous switching between two different distributions of the electric field, which is attributed to two distinct current domain configurations.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

article,Nearly non-magnetic valence band of the ferromagnetic semiconductor GaMnAs,"<p>The origin of ferromagnetism in the prototype ferromagnetic semiconductor GaMnAs is controversial because of an insufficient understanding of its band structure and Fermi level position. This is a major issue for further development of this material for future semiconductor spintronics. Here, using a unique method combining a precise etching technique and resonant tunnelling spectroscopy, applied to a variety of surface GaMnAs layers, we can elucidate the universal valence-band (VB) picture of GaMnAs. We find that the VB structure of GaAs is almost perfectly maintained and does not merge with the impurity band for any of the GaMnAs samples, with Mn concentrations ranging from 6 to 15%, that we examined. Furthermore, the exchange splitting of the VB is found to be very small (only several millielectronvolts), even in GaMnAs with a high Curie temperature (154&#8201;K). Our findings shed light on the precise mechanism behind ferromagnetism in GaMnAs; a subject that has been debated for more than a decade.</p>",[],False,"[""Shinobu Ohya"", ""Kenta Takata"", ""Masaaki Tanaka""]","Ohya, S., Takata, K. & Tanaka, M.

article,Gate-dependent spin–orbit coupling in multielectron carbon nanotubes,"<p>Understanding how the orbital motion of electrons is coupled to the spin degree of freedom in nanoscale systems is central for applications in spin-based electronics and quantum computation. Here we demonstrate such spin&#8211;orbit coupling in a carbon-nanotube quantum dot in the general multielectron regime and in the presence of finite disorder. Also, we find a systematic dependence of the spin&#8211;orbit coupling on the electron occupation of the quantum dot. Such a dependence has not been seen in any other system and follows from the curvature-induced spin&#8211;orbit-split Dirac spectrum of the underlying graphene lattice. Our findings suggest that the spin&#8211;orbit coupling is a general property of carbon-nanotube quantum dots, which should provide a unique platform for the study of spin&#8211;orbit effects and their applications.</p>",[],False,"[""T.

article,Piezoresistive heat engine and refrigerator,"<p>Heat engines provide most of our mechanical power and are essential for transportation on the macroscopic scale. However, although significant progress has been made in the miniaturization of electrostatic engines, it has proved difficult to reduce the size of liquid- or gas-driven heat engines below 10<sup>7</sup>&#8201;&#956;m<sup>3</sup>. Here we demonstrate that a crystalline silicon structure operates as a cyclic piezoresistive heat engine when it is driven by a sufficiently high d.c. current. A 0.34&#8201;&#956;m<sup>3</sup> engine beam draws heat from the d.c. current using the piezoresistive effect and converts it into mechanical work by expansion and contraction at different temperatures. This mechanical power drives a silicon resonator of 1.1&#215;10<sup>3</sup>&#8201;&#956;m<sup>3</sup> into sustained oscillation. Even below the oscillation threshold the engine beam continues to amplify the resonator&#8217;s Brownian motion.

article,Observations and simulations of non-local acceleration of electrons in magnetotail magnetic reconnection events,"<p>Magnetic reconnection in magnetized plasmas represents a change in magnetic field topology and is associated with a concomitant energization of charged particles that results from a conversion of magnetic energy into particle energy. In Earth&#8217;s magnetosphere this process is associated with the entry of the solar wind into the magnetosphere and with the initiation of auroral substorms. Using data from the THEMIS mission, together with global and test particle simulations, we demonstrate that electrons are energized in two distinct regions: a low-energy population (less than or equal to a few kiloelectronvolts) that arises in a diffusion region where particles are demagnetized and the magnetic topology changes, and a high-energy component (approaching 100&#8201;keV) that results from betatron acceleration within dipolarization fronts that sweep towards the inner magnetosphere far from the diffusion region.
