article,Quantum simulation of the wavefunction to probe frustrated Heisenberg spin systems,"<p>Quantum simulators are controllable quantum systems that can reproduce the dynamics of the system of interest in situations that are not amenable to classical computers. Recent developments in quantum technology enable the precise control of individual quantum particles as required for studying complex quantum systems. In particular, quantum simulators capable of simulating frustrated Heisenberg spin systems provide platforms for understanding exotic matter such as high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the analogue quantum simulation of the ground-state wavefunction to probe arbitrary Heisenberg-type interactions among four spin-1/2 particles. Depending on the interaction strength, frustration within the system emerges such that the ground state evolves from a localized to a resonating-valence-bond state. This spin-1/2 tetramer is created using the polarization states of four photons. The single-particle addressability and tunable measurement-induced interactions provide us with insights into entanglement dynamics among individual particles. We directly extract ground-state energies and pairwise quantum correlations to observe the monogamy of entanglement.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiao-song Ma"", ""Borivoje Dakic"", ""William Naylor"", ""Anton Zeilinger"", ""Philip Walther""]","Ma, Xs., Dakic, B., Naylor, W. et al.

article,General framework for estimating the ultimate precision limit in noisy quantum-enhanced metrology,"<p>The estimation of parameters characterizing dynamical processes is central to science and technology. The estimation error changes with the number N of resources employed in the experiment (which could quantify, for instance, the number of probes or the probing energy). Typically, it scales as . Quantum strategies may improve the precision, for noiseless processes, by an extra factor . For noisy processes, it is not known in general if and when this improvement can be achieved. Here we propose a general framework for obtaining attainable and useful lower bounds for the ultimate limit of precision in noisy systems. We apply this bound to lossy optical interferometry and atomic spectroscopy in the presence of dephasing, showing that it captures the main features of the transition from the 1/N to the  behaviour as N increases, independently of the initial state of the probes, and even with use of adaptive feedback.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

article,Non-Abelian statistics and topological quantum information processing in 1D wire networks,"<p>The synthesis of a quantum computer remains an ongoing challenge in modern physics. Whereas decoherence stymies most approaches, topological quantum computation schemes evade decoherence at the hardware level by storing quantum information non-locally. Here we establish that a key operation&#8212;braiding of non-Abelian anyons&#8212;can be implemented using one-dimensional semiconducting wires. Such wires can be driven into a topological phase supporting long-sought particles known as Majorana fermions that can encode topological qubits. We show that in wire networks, Majorana fermions can be meaningfully braided by simply adjusting gate voltages, and that they exhibit non-Abelian statistics like vortices in a p+i p superconductor. We propose experimental set-ups that enable probing of the Majorana fusion rules and the efficient exchange of arbitrary numbers of Majorana fermions. This work should open a new direction in topological quantum computation that benefits from physical transparency and experimental feasibility.</p>",[],False,"[""Jason Alicea"", ""Yuval Oreg"", ""Gil Refael"", ""Felix von Oppen"", ""Matthew P.

article,Single valley Dirac fermions in zero-gap HgTe quantum wells,"<p>Dirac fermions have been studied intensively in condensed matter physics in recent years. Many theoretical predictions critically depend on the number of valleys where the Dirac fermions are realized. We now report the discovery of a two-dimensional system with a single, spin-degenerate Dirac valley. We study the transport properties of HgTe quantum wells grown at a critical thickness where the band gap vanishes. In a magnetic field, we observe quantum Hall plateaux that exhibit the anomalous sequence characteristic of Dirac systems. The filling factors at which the plateaux occur are direct evidence of the presence of a single Dirac valley in the system. Also the conductivity at the Dirac point and its temperature dependence can be understood from single valley Dirac fermion physics. Our observations pave the way to study quantum interference and ballistic transport phenomena of Dirac fermions, which so far have been hard to access.</p>",[],False,"[""B. B\u00fcttner"", ""C. X.

article,Current quantization in an optically driven electron pump based on self-assembled quantum dots,"<p>The electronic structure of self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots consists of discrete atom-like states that can be populated with a well-defined number of electrons. This property can be used to fabricate a d.c. current standard that enables the unit of ampere to be independently defined. Here we report an optically pumped current source based on self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots. The accuracy obtained so far is 10<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and is limited by the uncertainty in the number of dots. At 10&#8201;K the device generates a current difference of 2.39&#8201;nA at a frequency of 1&#8201;kHz. The accuracy could be improved by site-selective growth techniques where the number of dots is fixed by pre-patterning. The results are promising for applications in electrical metrology, where a current standard is needed to close the so-called quantum metrological triangle.</p>",[],False,"[""L. Nevou"", ""V.

article,Timing the release in sequential double ionization,"<p>The timing of electron release in strong-field double ionization poses great challenges both for conceptual definition and for conducting experimental measurements. Here we present coincidence momentum measurements of the doubly charged ion and of the two electrons arising from double ionization of argon using elliptically polarized laser pulses. Based on a semi-classical model, the ionization times are calculated from the measured electron momenta across a large intensity range. This paper discusses how this method provides timings on a coarse and on a fine scale, similar to the hour and the minute hand of a clock. We found that the ionization time of the first electron is in good agreement with the simulation, whereas the ionization of the second electron occurs significantly earlier than predicted.</p>",[],False,"[""Adrian N.

article,Multi-component quantum gases in spin-dependent hexagonal lattices,"<p>In solid-state materials, the static and dynamic properties as well as the magnetic and electronic characteristics are crucially influenced by the crystal symmetry. Hexagonal structures play a particularly important role and lead to novel physics, such as that of carbon nanotubes or graphene. Here we report on the realization of ultracold atoms in a spin-dependent optical lattice with hexagonal symmetry. We show how the combined effects of the lattice and interactions between atoms lead to a forced antiferromagnetic N&#233;el order when two spin-components localize at different lattice sites. We also demonstrate that the coexistence of two components&#8212;one Mott-insulating and the other one superfluid&#8212;leads to an interaction-induced modulation of the superfluid density, which is observed spectroscopically. Our studies reveal the vast impact of the interaction-induced modulation on the superfluid-to-Mott-insulator transition.
