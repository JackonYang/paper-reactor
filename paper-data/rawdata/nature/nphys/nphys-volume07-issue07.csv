article,"Confinement of antihydrogen for 1,000 seconds","<p>Atoms made of a particle and an antiparticle are unstable, usually surviving less than a microsecond. Antihydrogen, made entirely of antiparticles, is believed to be stable, and it is this longevity that holds the promise of precision studies of matter&#8211;antimatter symmetry. We have recently demonstrated trapping of antihydrogen atoms by releasing them after a confinement time of 172&#8201;ms. A critical question for future studies is: how long can anti-atoms be trapped? Here, we report the observation of anti-atom confinement for 1,000&#8201;s, extending our earlier results by nearly four orders of magnitude. Our calculations indicate that most of the trapped anti-atoms reach the ground state. Further, we report the first measurement of the energy distribution of trapped antihydrogen, which, coupled with detailed comparisons with simulations, provides a key tool for the systematic investigation of trapping dynamics. These advances open up a range of experimental possibilities, including precision studies of charge&#8211;parity&#8211;time reversal symmetry and cooling to temperatures where gravitational effects could become apparent.</p>",[],False,"[""G.

article,Noise spectroscopy through dynamical decoupling with a superconducting flux qubit,"<p>Quantum coherence in natural and artificial spin systems is fundamental to applications ranging from quantum information science to magnetic-resonance imaging and identification. Several multipulse control sequences targeting generalized noise models have been developed to extend coherence by dynamically decoupling a spin system from its noisy environment. In any particular implementation, however, the efficacy of these methods is sensitive to the specific frequency distribution of the noise, suggesting that these same pulse sequences could also be used to probe the noise spectrum directly. Here we demonstrate noise spectroscopy by means of dynamical decoupling using a superconducting qubit with energy-relaxation time T<sub>1</sub>=12&#8201;&#956;s. We first demonstrate that dynamical decoupling improves the coherence time T<sub>2</sub> in this system up to the T<sub>2</sub>=2&#8201;T<sub>1</sub> limit (pure dephasing times exceeding 100&#8201;&#956;s), and then leverage its filtering properties to probe the environmental noise over a frequency (f) range 0.2&#8211;20&#8201;MHz, observing a 1/f<sup>&#945;</sup> distribution with &#945;&lt;1. The characterization of environmental noise has broad utility for spin-resonance applications, enabling the design of optimized coherent-control methods, promoting device and materials engineering, and generally improving coherence.</p>",[],False,"[""Jonas Bylander"", ""Simon Gustavsson"", ""Fei Yan"", ""Fumiki Yoshihara"", ""Khalil Harrabi"", ""George Fitch"", ""David G.

article,Parahydrogen-enhanced zero-field nuclear magnetic resonance,"<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance, conventionally detected in magnetic fields of several tesla, is a powerful analytical tool for the determination of molecular identity, structure and function. With the advent of prepolarization methods and detection schemes using atomic magnetometers or superconducting quantum interference devices, interest in NMR in fields comparable to the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and below (down to zero field) has been revived. Despite the use of superconducting quantum interference devices or atomic magnetometers, low-field NMR typically suffers from low sensitivity compared with conventional high-field NMR. Here we demonstrate direct detection of zero-field NMR signals generated through parahydrogen-induced polarization, enabling high-resolution NMR without the use of any magnets. The sensitivity is sufficient to observe spectra exhibiting <sup>13</sup>C&#8211;<sup>1</sup>H scalar nuclear spin&#8211;spin couplings (known as J&#160;couplings) in compounds with <sup>13</sup>C in natural abundance, without the need for signal averaging.

article,Direct observation of the full transition from ballistic to diffusive Brownian motion in a liquid,"<p>At timescales once deemed immeasurably small by Einstein, the random movement of Brownian particles in a liquid is expected to be replaced by ballistic motion. So far, an experimental verification of this prediction has been out of reach due to a lack of instrumentation fast and precise enough to capture this motion. Here we report the observation of the Brownian motion of a single particle in an optical trap with 75&#8201;MHz bandwidth and sub-&#229;ngstr&#246;m spatial precision and the determination of the particle&#8217;s velocity autocorrelation function. Our observation is the first measurement of ballistic Brownian motion of a particle in a liquid.

article,Phase transitions in contagion processes mediated by recurrent mobility patterns,"<p>Human mobility and activity patterns mediate contagion on many levels, including the spatial spread of infectious diseases, diffusion of rumours, and emergence of consensus. These patterns however are often dominated by specific locations and recurrent flows and poorly modelled by the random diffusive dynamics generally used to study them. Here we develop a theoretical framework to analyse contagion within a network of locations where individuals recall their geographic origins. We find a phase transition between a regime in which the contagion affects a large fraction of the system and one in which only a small fraction is affected. This transition cannot be uncovered by continuous deterministic models because of the stochastic features of the contagion process and defines an invasion threshold that depends on mobility parameters, providing guidance for controlling contagion spread by constraining mobility processes. We recover the threshold behaviour by analysing diffusion processes mediated by real human commuting data.</p>",[],False,"[""Duygu Balcan"", ""Alessandro Vespignani""]","Balcan, D., Vespignani, A.
