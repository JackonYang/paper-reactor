article,Hydrodynamic nucleation of quantized vortex pairs in a polariton quantum fluid,"<p>Quantized vortices appear in quantum gases at the breakdown of superfluidity. In liquid helium and cold atomic gases, they have been indentified as the quantum counterpart of turbulence in classical fluids. In the solid state, composite light&#8211;matter bosons known as exciton polaritons have enabled studies of non-equilibrium quantum gases and superfluidity. However, there has been no experimental evidence of hydrodynamic nucleation of polariton vortices so far. Here we report the experimental study of a polariton fluid flowing past an obstacle and the observation of nucleation of quantized vortex pairs in the wake of the obstacle. We image the nucleation mechanism and track the motion of the vortices along the flow. The nucleation conditions are established in terms of local fluid density and velocity measured on the obstacle perimeter. The experimental results are successfully reproduced by numerical simulations based on the resolution of the Gross&#8211;Pitaevskii equation.</p>",[],False,"[""Ga\u00ebl Nardin"", ""Gabriele Grosso"", ""Yoan L\u00e9ger"", ""Barbara Pi\u0229tka"", ""Fran\u00e7ois Morier-Genoud"", ""Beno\u00eet Deveaud-Pl\u00e9dran""]","Nardin, G., Grosso, G., Léger, Y. et al.

article,Interaction and filling-induced quantum phases of dual Mott insulators of bosons and fermions,"<p>Many-body effects are at the very heart of diverse phenomena found in condensed-matter physics. One striking example is the Mott-insulator phase, where conductivity is suppressed as a result of a strong repulsive interaction. Advances in cold-atom physics have led to the realization of the Mott-insulating phases of atoms in an optical lattice, mimicking the corresponding condensed-matter systems. Here, we explore an exotic strongly-correlated system of interacting dual Mott insulators of bosons and fermions. We find that an interspecies interaction between bosons and fermions drastically modifies each of the Mott insulators, causing effects that include melting, generation of composite particles, an anti-correlated phase and complete phase separation. Comparison between the experimental results and numerical simulations indicate intrinsic adiabatic heating and cooling for the attractively and repulsively interacting dual Mott insulators, respectively.</p>",[],False,"[""Seiji Sugawa"", ""Kensuke Inaba"", ""Shintaro Taie"", ""Rekishu Yamazaki"", ""Makoto Yamashita"", ""Yoshiro Takahashi""]","Sugawa, S., Inaba, K., Taie, S. et al.

article,Microscopic polarization in bilayer graphene,"<p>Bilayer graphene contains, compared to single-layer graphene, additional states related to the symmetry of the layers. These states can lead to the opening of a bandgap, which is highly desirable for device applications. The gap can be either tunable through an external electric field or spontaneously formed through an interaction-induced symmetry breaking. Here, we report scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements that reveal that the microscopic nature of the bilayer gap is very different from what has been observed in previous macroscopic measurements, and from what is expected from current theoretical models. The potential difference between the layers, which is proportional to charge imbalance and determines the gap value, shows a strong dependence on the disorder potential and varies spatially in both magnitude and sign on a microscopic level. Additional interaction-induced effects are observed on applying a magnetic field, as a subgap opens once the zero-orbital Landau level is placed at the Fermi energy.</p>",[],False,"[""Gregory M.

article,Controlled near-field enhanced electron acceleration from dielectric nanospheres with intense few-cycle laser fields,"<p>Collective electron motion in condensed matter typically unfolds on a sub-femtosecond timescale. The well-defined electric field evolution of intense, phase-stable few-cycle laser pulses provides an ideal tool for controlling this motion. The resulting manipulation of local electric fields at nanometre spatial and attosecond temporal scales offers unique spatio-temporal control of ultrafast nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, with important implications for the advancement of nanoelectronics. Here we demonstrate the attosecond control of the collective electron motion and directional emission from isolated dielectric (SiO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles with phase-stabilized few-cycle laser fields. A novel acceleration mechanism leading to the ejection of highly energetic electrons is identified by the comparison of the results to quasi-classical model calculations. The observed lightwave control in nanosized dielectrics has important implications for other material groups, including semiconductors and metals.</p>",[],False,"[""Sergey Zherebtsov"", ""Thomas Fennel"", ""J\u00fcrgen Plenge"", ""Egill Antonsson"", ""Irina Znakovskaya"", ""Adrian Wirth"", ""Oliver Herrwerth"", ""Frederik S\u00fc\u00dfmann"", ""Christian Peltz"", ""Izhar Ahmad"", ""Sergei A.
