article,Spontaneous atomic-scale magnetic skyrmion lattice in two dimensions,"<p>Skyrmions are topologically protected field configurations with particle-like properties that play an important role in various fields of science. Recently, skyrmions have been observed to be stabilized by an external magnetic field in bulk magnets. Here, we describe a two-dimensional square lattice of skyrmions on the atomic length scale as the magnetic ground state of a hexagonal Fe film of one-atomic-layer thickness on the Ir(111) surface. Using spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy we can directly image this non-collinear spin texture in real space on the atomic scale and demonstrate that it is incommensurate to the underlying atomic lattice. With the aid of first-principles calculations, we develop a spin model on a discrete lattice that identifies the interplay of Heisenberg exchange, the four-spin and the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction as the microscopic origin of this magnetic state.</p>",[],False,"[""Stefan Heinze"", ""Kirsten von Bergmann"", ""Matthias Menzel"", ""Jens Brede"", ""Andr\u00e9 Kubetzka"", ""Roland Wiesendanger"", ""Gustav Bihlmayer"", ""Stefan Bl\u00fcgel""]","Heinze, S., von Bergmann, K., Menzel, M. et al.

article,Electron-spin excitation coupling in an electron-doped copper oxide superconductor,"<p>High-temperature (high- T<sub>c</sub>) superconductivity in the copper oxides arises from electron or hole doping of their antiferromagnetic (AF) insulating parent compounds. The evolution of the AF phase with doping and its spatial coexistence with superconductivity are governed by the nature of charge and spin correlations, which provides clues to the mechanism of high- T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity. Here we use neutron scattering and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) to study the evolution of the bosonic excitations in electron-doped superconductor Pr<sub>0.88</sub>LaCe<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4&#8722;&#948;</sub> with different transition temperatures (T<sub>c</sub>) obtained through the oxygen annealing process. We find that spin excitations detected by neutron scattering have two distinct modes that evolve with T<sub>c</sub> in a remarkably similar fashion to the low-energy electron tunnelling modes detected by STS. These results demonstrate that antiferromagnetism and superconductivity compete locally and coexist spatially on nanometre length scales, and the dominant electron&#8211;boson coupling at low energies originates from the electron-spin excitations.</p>",[],False,"[""Jun Zhao"", ""F.

article,Intense paramagnon excitations in a large family of high-temperature superconductors,"<p>In the search for the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, intense research has been focused on the evolution of the spin excitation spectrum on doping from the antiferromagnetic insulating to the superconducting state of the cuprates. Because of technical limitations, the experimental investigation of doped cuprates has been largely focused on low-energy excitations in a small range of momentum space. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to show that a large family of superconductors, encompassing underdoped YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>4</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and overdoped YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, exhibits damped spin excitations (paramagnons) with dispersions and spectral weights closely similar to those of magnons in undoped cuprates. The comprehensive experimental description of this surprisingly simple spectrum enables quantitative tests of magnetic Cooper pairing models. A numerical solution of the Eliashberg equations for the magnetic spectrum of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> reproduces its superconducting transition temperature within a factor of two, a level of agreement comparable to that of Eliashberg theories of conventional superconductors.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

article,"Quantifying how DNA stretches, melts and changes twist under tension","<p>In cells, DNA is constantly twisted, bent and stretched by numerous proteins mediating genome transactions. Understanding these essential biological processes requires in-depth knowledge of how DNA complies to mechanical stress. Two important physical features of DNA, helical structure and sequence, are not incorporated in current descriptions of DNA elasticity. Here we connect well-defined force&#8211;extension measurements with a new model for DNA elasticity: the twistable worm-like chain, in which DNA is considered a helical, elastic entity that complies to tension by extending and twisting. In addition, we reveal hitherto unnoticed stick&#8211;slip dynamics during DNA overstretching at &#8764;65&#8201;pN, caused by the loss of base-pairing interactions. An equilibrium thermodynamic model solely based on DNA sequence and elasticity is presented, which captures the full complexity of this transition. These results offer deep quantitative insight in the physical properties of DNA and present a new standard description of DNA mechanics.</p>",[],False,"[""Peter Gross"", ""Niels Laurens"", ""Lene B.
