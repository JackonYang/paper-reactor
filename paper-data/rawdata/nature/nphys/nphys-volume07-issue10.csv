article,A quantum memory intrinsic to single nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond,"<p>A quantum memory, composed of a long-lived qubit coupled to each processing qubit, is important to building a scalable platform for quantum information science. These two qubits should be connected by a fast and high-fidelity operation to store and retrieve coherent quantum states. Here, we demonstrate a room-temperature quantum memory based on the spin of the nitrogen nucleus intrinsic to each nitrogen&#8211;vacancy (NV) centre in diamond. We perform coherent storage of a single NV centre electronic spin in a single nitrogen nuclear spin using Landau&#8211;Zener transitions across a hyperfine-mediated avoided level crossing. By working outside the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate coherent state transfer in as little as 120&#8201;ns with total storage fidelity of 88&#177;6%. This work demonstrates the use of a quantum memory that is compatible with scaling as the nitrogen nucleus is deterministically present in each NV centre defect.</p>",[],False,"[""G. D. Fuchs"", ""G.

article,Unconditional room-temperature quantum memory,"<p>Just as classical information systems require buffers and memory, the same is true for quantum information systems. The potential that optical quantum information processing holds for revolutionizing computation and communication is therefore driving significant research into developing optical quantum memory. A practical optical quantum memory must be able to store and recall quantum states on demand with high efficiency and low noise. Ideally, the platform for the memory would also be simple and inexpensive. Here, we present a complete tomographic reconstruction of quantum states that have been stored in the ground states of rubidium in a vapour cell operating at around 80&#8201;&#176;C. Without conditional measurements, we show recall fidelity up to 98% for coherent pulses containing around one photon. To unambiguously verify that our memory beats the quantum no-cloning limit we employ state-independent verification using conditional variance and signal-transfer coefficients.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

article,Quantum spectroscopy with Schrödinger-cat states,"<p>Laser-spectroscopic techniques that exploit light&#8211;matter entanglement promise access to many-body configurations. Their practical implementation, however, is hindered by the large number of coupled states involved. Here, we introduce a scheme to deal with this complexity by combining quantitative experiments with theoretical analysis. We analyse the absorption properties of semiconductor quantum wells and present a converging cluster-expansion transformation that robustly projects a large set of quantitative classical measurements onto the true quantum responses. Classical and quantum sources are shown to yield significantly different results; Schr&#246;dinger-cat states can enhance the signal by an order of magnitude. Moreover, squeezing of the source can help to individually control and characterize excitons, biexcitons and electron&#8211;hole complexes.</p>",[],False,"[""M. Kira"", ""S. W. Koch"", ""R. P.

article,Nodal quasiparticle meltdown in ultrahigh-resolution pump–probe angle-resolved photoemission,"<p>High-transition-temperature cuprate superconductors are characterized by a strong momentum-dependent anisotropy between the low-energy excitations along the Brillouin zone diagonal (nodal direction) and those along the Brillouin zone face (antinodal direction)&#8212;the most striking example of which is the d -wave superconducting gap, with the largest magnitude found in the antinodal direction and no gap in the nodal direction. Furthermore, whereas antinodal quasiparticle excitations occur only below the transition temperature (T<sub>c</sub>), superconductivity is thought to be indifferent to nodal excitations that are regarded as robust and insensitive to T<sub>c</sub>. Here we reveal an unexpected link between nodal quasiparticles and superconductivity using high-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission on optimally doped Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+&#948;</sub>. We observe a suppression of the nodal quasiparticle spectral weight following pump laser excitation, and measure its recovery dynamics. This suppression is greatly enhanced in the superconducting state.

article,Aharonov–Bohm interferences from local deformations in graphene,"<p>One of the most interesting aspects of graphene is the close relation between its structural and electronic properties. The observation of ripples both in free-standing graphene and in samples on a substrate has given rise to active investigation of the membrane-like properties of graphene, and the origin of the ripples remains one of the most interesting open problems concerning this system. The interplay of structural and electronic properties is successfully described by the modelling of curvature and elastic deformations by fictitious gauge fields. These fields have become an experimental reality after the observation of the Landau levels that can form in graphene due to strain. Here we propose a device to detect microstresses in graphene based on a scanning-tunnelling-microscopy set-up able to measure Aharonov&#8211;Bohm interferences at the nanometre scale. The predicted interferences in the local density of states are created by the fictitious magnetic field associated with elastic deformations of the sample.</p>",[],False,"[""Fernando de Juan"", ""Alberto Cortijo"", ""Mar\u00eda A.

article,Predicting the density-scaling exponent of a glass-forming liquid from Prigogine–Defay ratio measurements,"<p>Understanding the origin of the dramatic temperature and density dependence of the relaxation time of glass-forming liquids is a fundamental challenge in glass science. The recently established &#8216;density-scaling&#8217; relation quantifies the relative importance of temperature and density for the relaxation time in terms of a material-dependent exponent. We show that this exponent for approximate single-parameter liquids can be calculated from thermoviscoelastic linear-response data at a single state point, for instance an ambient-pressure state point. This prediction is confirmed for the van der Waals liquid tetramethyl-tetraphenyl-trisiloxane. Consistent with this, a compilation of literature data for the Prigogine&#8211;Defay ratio shows that van der Waals liquids and polymers are approximate single-parameter systems, whereas associated and network-forming liquids are not.</p>",[],False,"[""Ditte Gundermann"", ""Ulf R.

The orbital retrieval is nevertheless seriously hindered by the complexity of the harmonic emission process, as recently demonstrated by several theoretical and experimental works.
