article,Ultrafast coherent control and suppressed nuclear feedback of a single quantum dot hole qubit,"<p>Future communication and computation technologies that exploit quantum information require robust and well-isolated qubits. Electron spins in III&#8211;V semiconductor quantum dots, although promising candidate qubits, see their dynamics limited by undesirable hysteresis and decohering effects of the nuclear spin bath. Replacing electrons with valence-band holes should suppress the hyperfine interaction and consequently eliminate strong nuclear effects. Such suppression was recently observed in optical initialization and coherent population trapping experiments, but complete control over the phase of an arbitrary hole superposition&#8212;the essence of a hole-based qubit&#8212;has not yet been achieved. Using picosecond optical pulses, we now demonstrate complete coherent control of a single hole qubit and examine both free-induction and spin-echo decay. In moving from electrons to holes, we observe the effects of the reduced hyperfine interactions in the re-emergence of hysteresis-free dynamics, while obtaining similar coherence times limited by non-nuclear mechanisms. These results demonstrate the potential of optically controlled quantum-dot hole qubits.</p>",[],False,"[""Kristiaan De Greve"", ""Peter L. McMahon"", ""David Press"", ""Thaddeus D.

article,A single nitrogen-vacancy defect coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator,"<p>We position a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre hosted in a diamond nanocrystal at the extremity of a SiC nanowire. This novel hybrid system couples the degrees of freedom of two radically different systems: a nanomechanical oscillator and a single quantum object. We probe the dynamics of the nano-resonator through time-resolved nanocrystal fluorescence and photon-correlation measurements, conveying the influence of a mechanical degree of freedom on a non-classical photon emitter. Moreover, by immersing the system in a strong magnetic field gradient, we induce a magnetic coupling between the nanomechanical oscillator and the NV electronic spin, providing nanomotion readout through a single electronic spin. Spin-dependent forces inherent to this coupling scheme are essential in a variety of active cooling and entanglement protocols used in atomic physics, and should now be within the reach of nanomechanical hybrid systems.</p>",[],False,"[""O.

article,Single- and two-particle energy gaps across the disorder-driven superconductor–insulator transition,"<p>The competition between superconductivity and localization raises profound questions in condensed-matter physics. In spite of decades of research, the mechanism of the superconductor&#8211;insulator transition and the nature of the insulator are not understood. We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations that treat, on an equal footing, inhomogeneous amplitude variations and phase fluctuations, a major advance over previous theories. We gain new microscopic insights and make testable predictions for local spectroscopic probes. The energy gap in the density of states survives across the transition, but coherence peaks exist only in the superconductor. A characteristic pseudogap persists above the critical disorder and critical temperature, in contrast to conventional theories. Surprisingly, the insulator has a two-particle gap scale that vanishes at the superconductor&#8211;insulator transition, despite a robust single-particle gap.</p>",[],False,"[""Karim Bouadim"", ""Yen Lee Loh"", ""Mohit Randeria"", ""Nandini Trivedi""]","Bouadim, K., Loh, Y., Randeria, M. et al.

article,High-field superconductivity at an electronic topological transition in URhGe,"<p>The emergence of superconductivity at high magnetic fields in URhGe is regarded as a paradigm for new state formation approaching a quantum critical point. Until now, a divergence of the quasiparticle mass at the metamagnetic transition was considered essential for superconductivity to survive at magnetic fields above 30&#8201;T. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in URhGe revealing a tiny pocket of heavy quasiparticles that shrinks continuously with increasing magnetic field, and finally disappears at a topological Fermi surface transition close to or at the metamagnetic field. The quasiparticle mass decreases and remains finite, implying that the Fermi velocity vanishes due to the collapse of the Fermi wavevector. This offers a novel explanation for the re-emergence of superconductivity at extreme magnetic fields and makes URhGe the first proven example of a material where magnetic field-tuning of the Fermi surface, rather than quantum criticality alone, governs quantum phase formation.</p>",[],False,"[""E.

article,Enhancement of superconductivity by a parallel magnetic field in two-dimensional superconductors,"<p>Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter characterized by the formation of Cooper pairs from time-reversal-symmetric electronic states. Mechanisms that break this symmetry, such as magnetic-impurity scattering and applied magnetic fields, are expected to be detrimental to superconductivity and suppress the critical temperature. Here, we report the observation of pronounced increases in the mean-field critical temperature on application of a parallel magnetic field in two different two-dimensional superconducting systems: ultrathin, homogeneously disordered amorphous Pb films and the two-dimensional electron gas at the interface of LaAlO<sub>3</sub> and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>. In the amorphous Pb films, the critical-temperature increases exhibit a systematic dependence on the film thickness. Significantly, the presence of paramagnetic impurities in the films diminishes the effect of field enhancement of superconductivity. These observations mark a radical departure from the current understanding of the interactions between magnetic fields and superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""H.

We have succeeded in implementing this concept experimentally for cobalt dimers clamped between a scanning tunnelling microscope tip and a gold surface. Control of the tip&#8211;sample distance with subpicometre resolution enables us to tune the interaction between the two cobalt atoms with unprecedented precision.

This robustness is exemplified by quantized conductance and edge state transport in the quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall effects. Here we show how exploiting topological properties of optical systems can be used to improve photonic devices. We demonstrate how quantum spin Hall Hamiltonians can be created with linear optical elements using a network of coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROW) in two dimensions. We find that key features of quantum Hall systems, including the characteristic Hofstadter butterfly and robust edge state transport, can be obtained in such systems. As a specific application, we show that topological protection can be used to improve the performance of optical delay lines and to overcome some limitations related to disorder in photonic technologies.</p>",[],False,"[""Mohammad Hafezi"", ""Eugene A.

The system&#8217;s energy can also be changed by performing non-adiabatic work using a cyclic process. Almost nothing is known about the resulting energy distribution in this set-up, which is in particular relevant to recent experimental progress in cold atoms, ion traps, superconducting qubits and other systems. Here we show that when the non-adiabatic process consists of many repeated cyclic processes, the resulting energy distribution is universal and different from the Gibbs ensemble. We predict the existence of two qualitatively different regimes with a continuous second-order-like transition between them.
