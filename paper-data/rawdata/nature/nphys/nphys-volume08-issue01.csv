review article,Between order and chaos,"<p>What is a pattern? How do we come to recognize patterns never seen before? Quantifying the notion of pattern and formalizing the process of pattern discovery go right to the heart of physical science. Over the past few decades physics&#8217; view of nature&#8217;s lack of structure&#8212;its unpredictability&#8212;underwent a major renovation with the discovery of deterministic chaos, overthrowing two centuries of Laplace&#8217;s strict determinism in classical physics. Behind the veil of apparent randomness, though, many processes are highly ordered, following simple rules. Tools adapted from the theories of information and computation have brought physical science to the brink of automatically discovering hidden patterns and quantifying their structural complexity.</p>",[],False,"[""James P.

review article,"Communities, modules and large-scale structure in networks","<p>Networks, also called graphs by mathematicians, provide a useful abstraction of the structure of many complex systems, ranging from social systems and computer networks to biological networks and the state spaces of physical systems. In the past decade there have been significant advances in experiments to determine the topological structure of networked systems, but there remain substantial challenges in extracting scientific understanding from the large quantities of data produced by the experiments. A variety of basic measures and metrics are available that can tell us about small-scale structure in networks, such as correlations, connections and recurrent patterns, but it is considerably more difficult to quantify structure on medium and large scales, to understand the &#8216;big picture&#8217;. Important progress has been made, however, within the past few years, a selection of which is reviewed here.</p>",[],False,"[""M. E. J. Newman""]","Newman, M.

review article,Modelling dynamical processes in complex socio-technical systems,"<p>In recent years the increasing availability of computer power and informatics tools has enabled the gathering of reliable data quantifying the complexity of socio-technical systems. Data-driven computational models have emerged as appropriate tools to tackle the study of dynamical phenomena as diverse as epidemic outbreaks, information spreading and Internet packet routing. These models aim at providing a rationale for understanding the emerging tipping points and nonlinear properties that often underpin the most interesting characteristics of socio-technical systems. Here, using diffusion and contagion phenomena as prototypical examples, we review some of the recent progress in modelling dynamical processes that integrates the complex features and heterogeneities of real-world systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Alessandro Vespignani""]","Vespignani, A.

progress article,Networks formed from interdependent networks,"<p>Complex networks appear in almost every aspect of science and technology. Although most results in the field have been obtained by analysing isolated networks, many real-world networks do in fact interact with and depend on other networks. The set of extensive results for the limiting case of non-interacting networks holds only to the extent that ignoring the presence of other networks can be justified. Recently, an analytical framework for studying the percolation properties of interacting networks has been developed. Here we review this framework and the results obtained so far for connectivity properties of &#8216;networks of networks&#8217; formed by interdependent random networks.</p>",[],False,"[""Jianxi Gao"", ""Sergey V.

article,Enhanced electric conductivity at ferroelectric vortex cores in BiFeO3,"<p>Topological defects in ferroic materials are attracting much attention both as a playground of unique physical phenomena and for potential applications in reconfigurable electronic devices. Here, we explore electronic transport at artificially created ferroelectric vortices in BiFeO<sub>3</sub> thin films. The creation of one-dimensional conductive channels activated at voltages as low as 1&#8201;V is demonstrated. We study the electronic as well as the static and dynamic polarization structure of several topological defects using a combination of first-principles and phase-field modelling. The modelling predicts that the core structure can undergo a reversible transformation into a metastable twist structure, extending charged domain walls segments through the film thickness. The vortex core is therefore a dynamic conductor controlled by the coupled response of polarization and electron&#8211;mobile-vacancy subsystems with external bias. This controlled creation of conductive one-dimensional channels suggests a pathway for the design and implementation of integrated oxide electronic devices based on domain patterning.</p>",[],False,"[""Nina Balke"", ""Benjamin Winchester"", ""Wei Ren"", ""Ying Hao Chu"", ""Anna N.

article,Field-induced polarization of Dirac valleys in bismuth,"<p>The electronic structure of certain crystal lattices can contain multiple degenerate &#8217;valleys&#8217; for their charge carriers to occupy. This valley degree of freedom could be useful in the development of electronic devices. The principal challenge in the development of &#8217;valleytronics&#8217; is to lift the valley degeneracy of charge carriers in a controlled way. Here we show that in semi-metallic bismuth the flow of Dirac fermions along the trigonal axis is extremely sensitive to the orientation of in-plane magnetic field. Thus, a rotatable magnetic field can be used as a valley valve to tune the contribution of each valley to the total conductivity. At high temperature and low magnetic field, bismuth&#8217;s three valleys are interchangeable and the three-fold symmetry of its lattice is maintained. As the temperature is decreased or the magnetic field increased, this symmetry is spontaneously lost. This loss may be an experimental manifestation of the recently proposed valley-nematic Fermi liquid state.</p>",[],False,"[""Zengwei Zhu"", ""Aur\u00e9lie Collaudin"", ""Beno\u00eet Fauqu\u00e9"", ""Woun Kang"", ""Kamran Behnia""]","Zhu, Z., Collaudin, A., Fauqué, B. et al.

article,Collisionless shocks in laser-produced plasma generate monoenergetic high-energy proton beams,"<p>Compact and affordable ion accelerators based on laser-produced plasmas have potential applications in many fields of science and medicine. However, the requirement of producing focusable, narrow-energy-spread, energetic beams has proved to be challenging. Here we demonstrate that laser-driven collisionless shocks can accelerate proton beams to &#8764;20&#8201;MeV with extremely narrow energy spreads of about 1% and low emittances. This is achieved using a linearly polarized train of multiterawatt CO<sub>2</sub> laser pulses interacting with a gas-jet target. Computer simulations show that laser-heated electrons launch a collisionless shock that overtakes and reflects the protons in the slowly expanding hydrogen plasma, resulting in a narrow energy spectrum. Simulations predict the production of &#8764;200&#8201;MeV protons needed for radiotherapy by using current laser technology. These results open a way for developing a compact and versatile, high-repetition-rate ion source for medical and other applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Dan Haberberger"", ""Sergei Tochitsky"", ""Frederico Fiuza"", ""Chao Gong"", ""Ricardo A.
