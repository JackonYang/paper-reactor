article,High-fidelity quantum driving,"<p>Accurately controlling a quantum system is a fundamental requirement in quantum information processing and the coherent manipulation of molecular systems. The ultimate goal in quantum control is to prepare a desired state with the highest fidelity allowed by the available resources and the experimental constraints. Here we experimentally implement two optimal high-fidelity control protocols using a two-level quantum system comprising Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates in optical lattices. The first is a short-cut protocol that reaches the maximum quantum-transformation speed compatible with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In the opposite limit, we realize the recently proposed transitionless superadiabatic protocols in which the system follows the instantaneous adiabatic ground state nearly perfectly. We demonstrate that superadiabatic protocols are extremely robust against control parameter variations, making them useful for practical applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Mark G.

article,Doppler velocimetry of spin propagation in a two-dimensional electron gas,"<p>Controlling the flow of electrons by manipulating their spin is a key to the development of spin-based electronics. Recent demonstrations of electrical-gate control in spin-transistor configurations have shown great promise, but operation at room temperature remains elusive. Further progress requires a deeper understanding of the propagation of spin polarization, particularly in the high-mobility semiconductors used for devices. Here we report the application of Doppler velocimetry to resolve the motion of spin-polarized electrons in GaAs quantum wells driven by a drifting Fermi sea. We find that the spin mobility tracks the high electron mobility precisely as a function of temperature. However, we also observe that the coherent precession of spins driven by spin&#8211;orbit interaction, which is essential for the operation of a broad class of spin logic devices, breaks down at temperatures above 150&#8201;K, for reasons that are not yet understood theoretically.</p>",[],False,"[""Luyi Yang"", ""J.

article,Chiral superconductivity from repulsive interactions in doped graphene,"<p>Chiral superconductivity, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, can exhibit a wealth of fascinating properties that are highly sought after for nanoscience applications. We identify doped graphene monolayer as a system where chiral superconductivity can be realized. In this material, a unique situation arises at a doping where the Fermi surface is nested and the density of states is singular. In this regime, d-wave superconductivity can emerge from repulsive electron&#8211;electron interactions. Using a renormalization group method, we argue that superconductivity dominates over all competing orders for generic weak repulsive interactions. Superconductivity develops simultaneously in two degenerate d-wave pairing channels. We argue that the resulting superconducting state is of chiral type, with the phase of the superconducting order parameter winding by 4&#960; around the Fermi surface. Realization of this state in doped graphene will prove that superconductivity can emerge from electron&#8211;electron repulsion, and will open the door to applications of chiral superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Rahul Nandkishore"", ""L.

article,Non-monotonic temperature evolution of dynamic correlations in glass-forming liquids,"<p>The viscosity of glass-forming liquids increases by many orders of magnitude if their temperature is lowered by a mere factor of 2&#8211;3. Recent studies suggest that this widespread phenomenon is accompanied by spatially heterogeneous dynamics, and a growing dynamic correlation length quantifying the extent of correlated particle motion. Here we use a novel numerical method to detect and quantify spatial correlations that reveal a surprising non-monotonic temperature evolution of spatial dynamical correlations, accompanied by a second length scale that grows monotonically and has a very different nature. Our results directly unveil a dramatic qualitative change in atomic motions near the mode-coupling crossover temperature, which involves no fitting or indirect theoretical interpretation. These findings impose severe new constraints on the theoretical description of the glass transition, and open several research perspectives, in particular for experiments, to confirm and quantify our observations in real materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Walter Kob"", ""S\u00e1ndalo Rold\u00e1n-Vargas"", ""Ludovic Berthier""]","Kob, W., Roldán-Vargas, S. & Berthier, L.

article,Optical cavity cooling of mechanical modes of a semiconductor nanomembrane,"<p>Mechanical oscillators can be optically cooled using a technique known as optical-cavity back-action. Cooling of composite metal&#8211;semiconductor mirrors, dielectric mirrors and dielectric membranes has been demonstrated. Here we report cavity cooling of mechanical modes in a high-quality-factor and optically active semiconductor nanomembrane. The cooling is a result of electron&#8211;hole generation by cavity photons. Consequently, the cooling factor depends on the optical wavelength, varies drastically in the vicinity of the semiconductor bandgap, and follows the excitonic absorption behaviour. The resultant photo-induced rigidity is large and a mode temperature cooled from room temperature down to 4&#8201;K is realized with 50&#8201;&#956;W of light and a cavity finesse of just 10. Thermal stress due to non-radiative relaxation of the electron&#8211;hole pairs is the primary cause of the cooling. We also analyse an alternative cooling mechanism that is a result of electronic stress via the deformation potential, and outline future directions for cavity optomechanics with optically active semiconductors.</p>",[],False,"[""K.
