article,Fermionic transport and out-of-equilibrium dynamics in a homogeneous Hubbard model with ultracold atoms,"<p>Transport properties are among the defining characteristics of many important phases in condensed-matter physics. In the presence of strong correlations they are difficult to predict, even for model systems such as the Hubbard model. In real materials, additional complications arise owing to impurities, lattice defects or multi-band effects. Ultracold atoms in contrast offer the possibility to study transport and out-of-equilibrium phenomena in a clean and well-controlled environment and can therefore act as a quantum simulator for condensed-matter systems. Here we studied the expansion of an initially confined fermionic quantum gas in the lowest band of a homogeneous optical lattice. For non-interacting atoms, we observe ballistic transport, but even small interactions render the expansion almost bimodal, with a dramatically reduced expansion velocity. The dynamics is independent of the sign of the interaction, revealing a novel, dynamic symmetry of the Hubbard model.</p>",[],False,"[""Ulrich Schneider"", ""Lucia Hackerm\u00fcller"", ""Jens Philipp Ronzheimer"", ""Sebastian Will"", ""Simon Braun"", ""Thorsten Best"", ""Immanuel Bloch"", ""Eugene Demler"", ""Stephan Mandt"", ""David Rasch"", ""Achim Rosch""]","Schneider, U., Hackermüller, L., Ronzheimer, J. et al.

article,Giant superfluorescent bursts from a semiconductor magneto-plasma,"<p>Superradiance&#8212;the cooperative decay of excited dipoles&#8212;has recently been discussed in a diverse range of contexts in which coherent coupling of constituent particles governs their cooperative dynamics: cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum phase transitions and plasmonics. Here we observe intense, delayed bursts of coherent radiation from a photo-excited semiconductor and interpret it as superfluorescence, where macroscopic coherence spontaneously appears from initially incoherent electron&#8211;hole pairs. The coherence then decays superradiantly, with a concomitant abrupt decrease in population from full inversion to zero. This is the first observation of superfluorescence in a dense semiconductor plasma, where decoherence is much faster than radiative decay, a situation never encountered in atomic cases. Nonetheless, a many-body cooperative state of phased electron&#8211;hole &#8216;dipoles&#8217; does emerge at high magnetic fields and low temperatures, producing giant superfluorescent pulses. The solid-state realization of superfluorescence resulted in unprecedented controllability, promising tunable sources of coherent pulses.</p>",[],False,"[""G.

article,Femtosecond torsional relaxation,"<p>Molecular conformational reorganization following photon absorption is a fundamental process driving reactions such as the cis&#8211;trans isomerization at the heart of the primary step of vision and can be exploited for switching in artificial systems using photochromics. In general, conformational change occurs on a timescale defined by the energy of the main vibrational mode and the rate of energy dissipation. Typically, for a conformational change such as a twist around the backbone of a conjugated molecule, this occurs on the tens of picoseconds timescale. However, here we demonstrate experimentally that in certain circumstances the molecule, in this case an oligofluorene, can change conformation over two orders of magnitude faster (that is sub-100&#8201;fs) in a manner analogous to inertial solvent reorganization demonstrated in the 1990s. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that non-adiabatic transitions during internal conversion can efficiently convert electronic potential energy into torsional kinetic energy, providing the &#8216;kick&#8217; that prompts sub-100&#8201;fs torsional reorganization.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Probing and controlling non-Born–Oppenheimer dynamics in highly excited molecular ions,"<p>In the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray regions of the spectrum, light&#8211;matter interaction is dominated by photoionization. In molecular systems, the sudden removal of an electron will initiate ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics in the residual molecular ion. A particularly interesting aspect of these dynamics is the correlated motions of electrons and nuclei, an understanding of which lies at the heart of chemistry. Here we use a few-femtosecond high-harmonic pulse and a weak infrared laser pulse to initiate and probe the explosion of a triatomic N<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup> molecular ion in real time, in a regime dominated by coupled electron&#8211;electron and electron&#8211;nuclear dynamics.

article,A molecular conveyor belt by controlled delivery of single molecules into ultrashort laser pulses,"<p>Trapping and laser cooling in atomic physics enables control of single particles and their dynamics at the quantum level in a background-free environment. Ultrashort intense laser pulses reveal the ultimate control of electromagnetic fields, enabling the imaging of matter, in principle down to a single molecule or virus resolved on atomic scales. However, current methods fall short in overlapping each target with a pulse of comparable size. We combine the two fields by demonstrating a deterministic molecular conveyor, formed of electric trapping potentials. We deliver individual diatomic ions at millikelvin temperatures and with submicrometre positioning into few-femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. We initiate and probe the molecule&#8217;s femtosecond dynamics and detect it and its response with 100% efficiency. This experiment might become key for investigations of individual molecules, such as structural determinations using few-femtosecond X-ray lasers.

article,Acceleration in the linear non-scaling fixed-field alternating-gradient accelerator EMMA,"<p>In a fixed-field alternating-gradient (FFAG) accelerator, eliminating pulsed magnet operation permits rapid acceleration to synchrotron energies, but with a much higher beam-pulse repetition rate. Conceived in the 1950s, FFAGs are enjoying renewed interest, fuelled by the need to rapidly accelerate unstable muons for future high-energy physics colliders. Until now a &#8216;scaling&#8217; principle has been applied to avoid beam blow-up and loss. Removing this restriction produces a new breed of FFAG, a non-scaling variant, allowing powerful advances in machine characteristics. We report on the first non-scaling FFAG, in which orbits are compacted to within 10&#8201;mm in radius over an electron momentum range of 12&#8211;18&#8201;MeV/c. In this strictly linear-gradient FFAG, unstable beam regions are crossed, but acceleration via a novel serpentine channel is so rapid that no significant beam disruption is observed. This result has significant implications for future particle accelerators, particularly muon and high-intensity proton accelerators.</p>",[],False,"[""S. Machida"", ""R. Barlow"", ""J. S.
