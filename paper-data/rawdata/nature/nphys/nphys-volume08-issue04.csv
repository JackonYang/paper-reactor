The photonic quantum technology available today is reaching the stage where significant advantages arise for the simulation of interesting problems in quantum chemistry, quantum biology and solid-state physics. In addition, photonic quantum systems also offer the unique benefit of being mobile over free space and in waveguide structures, which opens new perspectives to the field by enabling the natural investigation of quantum transport phenomena.

progress article,On-chip quantum simulation with superconducting circuits,"<p>Using a well-controlled quantum system to simulate complex quantum matter is an idea that has been around for 30 years and put into practice in systems of ultracold atoms for more than a decade. Much recent excitement has focused on a new implementation of quantum simulators using superconducting circuits, where conventional microchip fabrication can be used to take design concepts to experimental reality, quickly and flexibly. Because the quantum &#8216;particles&#8217; in these simulators are circuit excitations rather than physical particles subject to conservation laws, superconducting simulators provide a complement to ultracold atoms by naturally accessing non-equilibrium physics.

article,Probing the relaxation towards equilibrium in an isolated strongly correlated one-dimensional Bose gas,"<p>The problem of how complex quantum systems eventually come to rest lies at the heart of statistical mechanics. The maximum-entropy principle describes which quantum states can be expected in equilibrium, but not how closed quantum many-body systems dynamically equilibrate. Here, we report the experimental observation of the non-equilibrium dynamics of a density wave of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice in the regime of strong correlations. Using an optical superlattice, we follow its dynamics in terms of quasi-local densities, currents and coherences&#8212;all showing a fast relaxation towards equilibrium values. Numerical calculations based on matrix-product states are in an excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data. The system fulfills the promise of being a dynamical quantum simulator, in that the controlled dynamics runs for longer times than present classical algorithms can keep track of.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

article,Satellites and large doping and temperature dependence of electronic properties in hole-doped BaFe2As2,"<p>Superconductivity has recently been discovered in several families of iron-based compounds, but despite intense research even such basic electronic properties of these materials as Fermi surfaces, effective electron masses and orbital characters are still subject to debate. Here, we address an issue that has not been considered before, namely the consequences of dynamical screening of the Coulomb interactions between Fe d&#160;electrons. We demonstrate that dynamical screening effects are important not only for higher-energy spectral features, such as correlation satellites seen in photoemission spectroscopy, but also for the low-energy electronic structure. Our analysis indicates that BaFe<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub> is a strongly correlated compound with strongly doping- and temperature-dependent properties. In the hole-overdoped regime an incoherent metal is found, whereas Fermi-liquid behaviour is recovered in the undoped compound. At optimal doping, the self-energy exhibits an unusual square-root energy dependence, which leads to strong band renormalizations near the Fermi level.</p>",[],False,"[""Philipp Werner"", ""Michele Casula"", ""Takashi Miyake"", ""Ferdi Aryasetiawan"", ""Andrew J.

article,Local probing of propagating acoustic waves in a gigahertz echo chamber,"<p>In the same way that micro-mechanical resonators resemble guitar strings and drums, surface acoustic waves resemble the sound these instruments produce, but moving over a solid surface rather than through air. In contrast with oscillations in suspended resonators, such propagating mechanical waves have not before been studied near the quantum mechanical limits. Here, we demonstrate local probing of surface acoustic waves with a displacement sensitivity of 30&#8201;am<sub>RMS</sub>&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> and detection sensitivity on the single-phonon level after averaging, at a frequency of 932&#8201;MHz. Our probe is a piezoelectrically coupled single-electron transistor, which is sufficiently fast, non-destructive and localized to enable us to track pulses echoing back and forth in a long acoustic cavity, self-interfering and ringing the cavity up and down. We project that strong coupling to quantum circuits will enable new experiments, and hybrids using the unique features of surface acoustic waves.

A four-wave mixing process causes laser power in multiple beams to change direction and add to the laser power of a selected beam.
