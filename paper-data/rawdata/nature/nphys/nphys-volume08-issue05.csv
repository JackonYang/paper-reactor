article,Probing Planck-scale physics with quantum optics,"<p>One of the main challenges in physics today is to merge quantum theory and the theory of general relativity into a unified framework. Researchers are developing various approaches towards such a theory of quantum gravity, but a major hindrance is the lack of experimental evidence of quantum gravitational effects. Yet, the quantization of spacetime itself can have experimental implications: the existence of a minimal length scale is widely expected to result in a modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Here we introduce a scheme to experimentally test this conjecture by probing directly the canonical commutation relation of the centre-of-mass mode of a mechanical oscillator with a mass close to the Planck mass. Our protocol uses quantum optical control and readout of the mechanical system to probe possible deviations from the quantum commutation relation even at the Planck scale. We show that the scheme is within reach of current technology. It thus opens a feasible route for table-top experiments to explore possible quantum gravitational phenomena.</p>",[],False,"[""Igor Pikovski"", ""Michael R. Vanner"", ""Markus Aspelmeyer"", ""M. S.

article,Three-dimensional localization of ultracold atoms in an optical disordered potential,"<p>In disordered media, quantum interference effects are expected to induce complete suppression of electron conduction. The phenomenon, known as Anderson localization, has a counterpart with classical waves that has been observed in acoustics, electromagnetism and optics, but a direct observation for particles remains elusive. Here, we report the observation of the three-dimensional localization of ultracold atoms in a disordered potential created by a speckle laser field. A phenomenological analysis of our data distinguishes a localized component of the resulting density profile from a diffusive component. The observed localization cannot be interpreted as the classical trapping of particles with energy below the classical percolation threshold in the disorder, nor can it be understood as quantum trapping in local potential minima. Instead, our data are compatible with the self-consistent theory of Anderson localization tailored to our system, involving a heuristic energy shift that offers scope for future interpretation.</p>",[],False,"[""F.

article,Two Ising-like magnetic excitations in a single-layer cuprate superconductor,"<p>There exists increasing evidence that the phase diagram of the high-transition temperature (T<sub>c</sub>) cuprate superconductors is controlled by a quantum critical point. According to one distinct theoretical proposal, on decreasing the hole-carrier concentration a transition occurs to an ordered state with two circulating orbital currents per CuO<sub>2</sub> square. Below the &#8216;pseudogap&#8217; temperature T<sup>*</sup>(T<sup>*</sup>&gt;T<sub>c</sub>), the theory predicts a discrete order parameter and two weakly-dispersive magnetic excitations in structurally simple compounds which should be measurable by neutron scattering. Indeed, novel magnetic order and one such excitation were recently observed. Here, we demonstrate for tetragonal HgBa<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4+&#948;</sub>&#160;the existence of a second excitation with local character, consistent with the theory. The excitations mix with conventional antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which points towards a unifying picture of magnetism in the cuprates that will probably require a multi-band&#160;description.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuan Li"", ""G.

article,Experimental observation of the optical spin transfer torque,"<p>The spin transfer torque is a phenomenon in which angular momentum of a spin polarized electrical current entering a ferromagnet is transferred to the magnetization. The effect has opened a new research field of electrically driven magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures and plays an important role in the development of a new generation of memory devices and tunable oscillators. Optical excitations of magnetic systems by laser pulses have been a separate research field the aim of which is to explore magnetization dynamics at short timescales and enable ultrafast spintronic devices. We report the experimental observation of the optical spin transfer torque, predicted theoretically several years ago, building the bridge between these two fields of spintronics research. In a pump-and-probe optical experiment we measure coherent spin precession in a (Ga, Mn)As ferromagnetic semiconductor excited by circularly polarized laser pulses. During the pump pulse, the spin angular momentum of photo-carriers generated by the absorbed light is transferred to the collective magnetization of the ferromagnet. We analyse quantitatively the observed magnetization dynamics triggered by the optical spin transfer torque using independently determined micromagnetic parameters and magneto-optical coefficients of the studied (Ga, Mn)As.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

article,The energy–speed–accuracy trade-off in sensory adaptation,"<p>Adaptation is the essential process by which an organism becomes better suited to its environment. The benefits of adaptation are well documented, but the cost it incurs remains poorly understood. Here, by analysing a stochastic model of a minimum feedback network underlying many sensory adaptation systems, we show that adaptive processes are necessarily dissipative, and continuous energy consumption is required to stabilize the adapted state. Our study reveals a general relation among energy dissipation rate, adaptation speed and the maximum adaptation accuracy. This energy&#8211;speed&#8211;accuracy relation is tested in the Escherichia coli chemosensory system, which exhibits near-perfect chemoreceptor adaptation. We identify key requirements for the underlying biochemical network to achieve accurate adaptation with a given energy budget. Moreover, direct measurements confirm the prediction that adaptation slows down as cells gradually de-energize in a nutrient-poor medium without compromising adaptation accuracy. Our work provides a general framework to study cost-performance trade-offs for cellular regulatory functions and information processing.</p>",[],False,"[""Ganhui Lan"", ""Pablo Sartori"", ""Silke Neumann"", ""Victor Sourjik"", ""Yuhai Tu""]","Lan, G., Sartori, P., Neumann, S. et al.

Here, we report the results of a comprehensive study that investigates the relation between the clustering properties in such small-world systems and the strength of interactions between its constituents, quantified by the link weight. For brain, gene, social and language networks, we find a local integrative weight organization in which strong links preferentially occur between nodes with overlapping neighbourhoods; we relate this to global robustness of the clustering to removal of the weakest links. Furthermore, we identify local learning rules that establish integrative networks and improve network traffic in response to past traffic failures. Our findings identify a general organization for complex systems that strikes a balance between efficient local and global communication in their strong interactions, while allowing for robust, exploratory development of weak interactions.</p>",[],False,"[""Sinisa Pajevic"", ""Dietmar Plenz""]","Pajevic, S., Plenz, D.
