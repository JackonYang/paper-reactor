article,On the reality of the quantum state,"<p>Quantum states are the key mathematical objects in quantum theory. It is therefore surprising that physicists have been unable to agree on what a quantum state truly represents. One possibility is that a pure quantum state corresponds directly to reality. However, there is a long history of suggestions that a quantum state (even a pure state) represents only knowledge or information about some aspect of reality. Here we show that any model in which a quantum state represents mere information about an underlying physical state of the system, and in which systems that are prepared independently have independent physical states, must make predictions that contradict those of quantum theory.</p>",[],False,"[""Matthew F.

article,Experimental delayed-choice entanglement swapping,"<p>Motivated by the question of which kind of physical interactions and processes are needed for the production of quantum entanglement, Peres has put forward the radical idea of delayed-choice entanglement swapping. There, entanglement can be &#8216;produced a posteriori, after the entangled particles have been measured and may no longer exist&#8217;. Here, we report the realization of Peres&#8217;s gedanken experiment. Using four photons, we can actively delay the choice of measurement&#8212;implemented through a high-speed tunable bipartite-state analyser and a quantum random-number generator&#8212;on two of the photons into the time-like future of the registration of the other two photons. This effectively projects the two already registered photons onto one of two mutually exclusive quantum states in which the photons are either entangled (quantum correlations) or separable (classical correlations). This can also be viewed as &#8216;quantum steering into the past&#8217;.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiao-song Ma"", ""Stefan Zotter"", ""Johannes Kofler"", ""Rupert Ursin"", ""Thomas Jennewein"", ""\u010caslav Brukner"", ""Anton Zeilinger""]","Ma, Xs., Zotter, S., Kofler, J. et al.

article,Spin polarization of the quantum spin Hall edge states,"<p>The prediction and experimental verification of the quantum spin Hall state marked the discovery of a new state of matter now known as topological insulators. Two-dimensional topological insulators exhibit the quantum spin-Hall effect, characterized by gapless spin-polarized counter-propagating edge channels. Whereas the helical character of these edge channels is now well established, experimental confirmation that the transport in the edge channels is spin polarized is still outstanding. We report experiments on nanostructures fabricated from HgTe quantum wells with an inverted band structure, in which a split gate technique allows us to combine both quantum spin Hall and metallic spin Hall transport in a single device. In these devices, the quantum spin Hall effect can be used as a spin current injector and detector for the metallic spin Hall effect, and vice versa, allowing for an all-electrical detection of spin polarization.</p>",[],False,"[""Christoph Br\u00fcne"", ""Andreas Roth"", ""Hartmut Buhmann"", ""Ewelina M.

article,Electric-field-induced ferromagnetic resonance excitation in an ultrathin ferromagnetic metal layer,"<p>Using resonant phenomena to exert coherent control over electron spin dynamics could enable more-energy-efficient spintronic devices and related technologies. Yet, achieving collective spin resonant control by ferromagnetic resonance excitation most often requires radiofrequency magnetic fields or the injection of spin-polarized currents that consume relatively large amounts of power. Inducing ferromagnetic resonances directly with an electric field offers a lower-power alternative to these, but doing so requires strong electric and magnetic coupling that is difficult to realize owing to screening effects, particularly in metallic materials. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced ferromagnetic resonance excitation by means of voltage control over the magnetic anisotropy in a few monolayers of FeCo at room temperature. The technique provides a low-power, highly localized and coherent means to manipulate electron spin dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""Takayuki Nozaki"", ""Yoichi Shiota"", ""Shinji Miwa"", ""Shinichi Murakami"", ""Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bonell"", ""Shota Ishibashi"", ""Hitoshi Kubota"", ""Kay Yakushiji"", ""Takeshi Saruya"", ""Akio Fukushima"", ""Shinji Yuasa"", ""Teruya Shinjo"", ""Yoshishige Suzuki""]","Nozaki, T., Shiota, Y., Miwa, S. et al.

article,Atom-by-atom engineering and magnetometry of tailored nanomagnets,"<p>Nanomagnets, namely arrays of a few exchange-coupled atomic magnetic moments, possess a rich variety of magnetic properties and are explored as constituents of nanospintronics technologies. They have been realized as magnetic clusters or molecular nanomagnets. Individual nanomagnets, built from magnetic atoms adsorbed onto a nonmagnetic surface (adatoms) coupled by Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida exchange, exhibit a high level of versatility resulting from distance-dependent interactions. Here, we combine spin-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy, atom manipulation and simulations to tailor nanomagnets ranging from linear chains to complex two-dimensional arrays and perform magnetometry in an atom-by-atom fashion. Distinct ground states of each chain, depending on even or odd numbers of constituent atoms, and magnetic frustration within the arrays have been observed directly. Our work demonstrates real-space access to the magnetic states of tailored nanostructures providing an approach to tackling open fundamental questions in magnetism.</p>",[],False,"[""Alexander Ako Khajetoorians"", ""Jens Wiebe"", ""Bruno Chilian"", ""Samir Lounis"", ""Stefan Bl\u00fcgel"", ""Roland Wiesendanger""]","Khajetoorians, A., Wiebe, J., Chilian, B. et al.
