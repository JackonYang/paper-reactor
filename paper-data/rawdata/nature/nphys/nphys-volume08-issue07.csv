article,Probing an ultracold-atom crystal with matter waves,"<p>Atomic quantum gases in optical lattices serve as a versatile testbed for important concepts of modern condensed-matter physics. The availability of methods to characterize strongly correlated phases is crucial for the study of these systems. Diffraction techniques to reveal long-range spatial structure, which may complement in situ detection methods, have been largely unexplored. Here we experimentally demonstrate that Bragg diffraction of neutral atoms can be used for this purpose. Using a one-dimensional Bose gas as a source of matter waves, we are able to infer the spatial ordering and on-site localization of atoms confined to an optical lattice. We also study the suppression of inelastic scattering between incident matter waves and the lattice-trapped atoms, occurring for increased lattice depth. Furthermore, we use atomic de Broglie waves to detect forced antiferromagnetic ordering in an atomic spin mixture, demonstrating the suitability of our method for the non-destructive detection of spin-ordered phases in strongly correlated atomic gases.</p>",[],False,"[""Bryce Gadway"", ""Daniel Pertot"", ""Jeremy Reeves"", ""Dominik Schneble""]","Gadway, B., Pertot, D., Reeves, J. et al.

article,Spin and valley quantum Hall ferromagnetism in graphene,"<p>Electronic systems with multiple degenerate degrees of freedom can support a rich variety of broken symmetry states. In a graphene Landau level (LL), strong Coulomb interactions and the fourfold spin&#8211;valley degeneracy lead to an approximate SU(4) isospin symmetry. At partial filling, exchange interactions can break this symmetry, manifesting as further Hall plateaus outside the normal integer sequence. Here we report the observation of a number of these quantum Hall isospin ferromagnetic (QHIFM) states, which we classify according to their real spin structure using tilted field magnetotransport. The large activation gaps confirm the Coulomb origin of all the broken symmetry states, but the order depends strongly on LL index. In the high-energy LLs the Zeeman effect is the dominant aligning field, leading to real spin ferromagnets hosting skyrmionic excitations at half filling, whereas in the &#8216;relativistic&#8217; zero LL lattice scale interactions drive the system to a spin unpolarized&#160;state.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Highly efficient spin transport in epitaxial graphene on SiC,"<p>Spin information processing is a possible new paradigm for post-CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) electronics and efficient spin propagation over long distances is fundamental to this vision. However, despite several decades of intense research, a suitable platform is still wanting. We report here on highly efficient spin transport in two-terminal polarizer/analyser devices based on high-mobility epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide. Taking advantage of high-impedance injecting/detecting tunnel junctions, we show spin transport efficiencies up to 75%, spin signals in the mega-ohm range and spin diffusion lengths exceeding 100&#8201;&#956;m. This enables spintronics in complex structures: devices and network architectures relying on spin information processing, well beyond present spintronics applications, can now be&#160;foreseen.</p>",[],False,"[""Bruno Dlubak"", ""Marie-Blandine Martin"", ""Cyrile Deranlot"", ""Bernard Servet"", ""St\u00e9phane Xavier"", ""Richard Mattana"", ""Mike Sprinkle"", ""Claire Berger"", ""Walt A.

article,Multiscale photosynthetic and biomimetic excitation energy transfer,"<p>Recent evidence suggests that quantum coherence enhances excitation energy transfer (EET) through individual photosynthetic light-harvesting protein complexes (LHCs). Its role in vivo is unclear however, where transfer to chemical reaction centres (RCs) spans larger, multi-LHC/RC networks. Here we predict maximum coherence lengths possible in fully connected chromophore networks with the generic structural and energetic features of multi-LHC/RC networks. A renormalization analysis reveals the dependence of EET dynamics on multiscale, hierarchical network structure. Surprisingly, thermal decoherence rate declines at larger length scales for physiological parameters and coherence length is instead limited by localization due to static disorder. Physiological parameters support coherence lengths up to &#8764; 5&#8201;nm, which is consistent with observations of solvated LHCs and invites experimental tests for intercomplex coherences in multi-LHC/RC networks. Results further suggest that a semiconductor quantum dot network engineered with hierarchically clustered structure and small static disorder may support coherent EET over larger length scales, at ambient temperatures.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Controlling edge dynamics in complex networks,"<p>The interaction of distinct units in physical, social, biological and technological systems naturally gives rise to complex network structures. Networks have constantly been in the focus of research for the past decade, with considerable advances in the description of their structural and dynamical properties. However, much less effort has been devoted to studying the controllability of the dynamics taking place on them. Here we introduce and evaluate a dynamical process defined on the edges of a network, and demonstrate that the controllability properties of this process significantly differ from simple nodal dynamics. Evaluation of real-world networks indicates that most of them are more controllable than their randomized counterparts. We also find that transcriptional regulatory networks are particularly easy to control. Analytic calculations show that networks with scale-free degree distributions have better controllability properties than uncorrelated networks, and positively correlated in- and out-degrees enhance the controllability of the proposed dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""Tam\u00e1s Nepusz"", ""Tam\u00e1s Vicsek""]","Nepusz, T., Vicsek, T.
