article,Hedgehog spin texture and Berry's phase tuning in a magnetic topological insulator,"<p>Understanding and control of spin degrees of freedom on the surfaces of topological materials are key to future applications as well as for realizing novel physics such as the axion electrodynamics associated with time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking on the surface. We experimentally demonstrate magnetically induced spin reorientation phenomena simultaneous with a Dirac-metal to gapped-insulator transition on the surfaces of manganese-doped Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> thin films. The resulting electronic groundstate exhibits unique hedgehog-like spin textures at low energies, which directly demonstrate the mechanics of TR symmetry breaking on the surface. We further show that an insulating gap induced by quantum tunnelling between surfaces exhibits spin texture modulation at low energies but respects TR invariance. These spin phenomena and the control of their Fermi surface geometrical phase first demonstrated in our experiments pave the way for the future realization of many predicted exotic magnetic phenomena of topological origin.</p>",[],False,"[""Su-Yang Xu"", ""Madhab Neupane"", ""Chang Liu"", ""Duming Zhang"", ""Anthony Richardella"", ""L.

article,"A wideband, low-noise superconducting amplifier with high dynamic range","<p>An ideal amplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has large dynamic range. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these characteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer multi-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range, but their noise remains far above the limit set by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers can reach the quantum-mechanical limit, but generally are narrow band and have very limited dynamic range. Here we describe a parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations through the use of a travelling-wave geometry and the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2&#8201;GHz on either side of an 11.56&#8201;GHz pump tone and place an upper limit on the added noise of 3.4 photons at 9.4&#8201;GHz. The dynamic range is very large, and the concept can be applied from gigahertz frequencies to &#8764; 1&#8201;THz.</p>",[],False,"[""Byeong Ho Eom"", ""Peter K. Day"", ""Henry G.

article,Mechanical waves during tissue expansion,"<p>The processes by which an organism develops its shape and heals wounds involve expansion of a monolayer sheet of cells. The mechanism underpinning this epithelial expansion remains obscure, despite the fact that its failure is known to contribute to several diseases, including carcinomas, which account for about 90% of all human cancers. Here, using the micropatterned epithelial monolayer as a model system, we report the discovery of a mechanical wave that propagates slowly to span the monolayer, traverses intercellular junctions in a cooperative manner and builds up differentials of mechanical stress. Essential features of this wave generation and propagation are captured by a minimal model based on sequential fronts of cytoskeletal reinforcement and fluidization. These findings establish a mechanism of long-range cell guidance, symmetry breaking and pattern formation during monolayer expansion.</p>",[],False,"[""Xavier Serra-Picamal"", ""Vito Conte"", ""Romaric Vincent"", ""Ester Anon"", ""Dhananjay T.
