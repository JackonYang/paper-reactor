article,Quantum discord as resource for remote state preparation,"<p>The existence of better-than-classical quantum information processing (QIP) models which consume very little or no entanglement suggests that separable or weakly entangled states could be extremely useful tools for information processing as they are much easier to prepare and control even in dissipative environments. It has been proposed that a resource of advantage is the generation of quantum discord, a measure of non-classical correlations that includes entanglement as a subset. Here we show that quantum discord is the necessary resource for quantum remote state preparation. We explicitly show that the geometric measure of quantum discord is related to the fidelity of this task, which provides its operational meaning. Our results are experimentally demonstrated using photonic quantum systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that separable states with non-zero quantum discord can outperform entangled states. Therefore, the role of quantum discord might provide fundamental insights for resource-efficient QIP.</p>",[],False,"[""Borivoje Daki\u0107"", ""Yannick Ole Lipp"", ""Xiaosong Ma"", ""Martin Ringbauer"", ""Sebastian Kropatschek"", ""Stefanie Barz"", ""Tomasz Paterek"", ""Vlatko Vedral"", ""Anton Zeilinger"", ""\u010caslav Brukner"", ""Philip Walther""]","Dakić, B., Lipp, Y., Ma, X. et al.

article,Observing the operational significance of discord consumption,"<p>Coherent interactions that generate negligible entanglement can still exhibit unique quantum behaviour. This observation has motivated a search beyond entanglement for a complete description of all quantum correlations. Quantum discord is a promising candidate. Here, we demonstrate that under certain measurement constraints, discord between bipartite systems can be consumed to encode information that can only be accessed by coherent quantum interactions. The inability to access this information by any other means allows us to use discord to directly quantify this &#8216;quantum advantage&#8217;. We experimentally encode information within the discordant correlations of two separable Gaussian states. The amount of extra information recovered by coherent interaction is quantified and directly linked with the discord consumed during encoding. No entanglement exists at any point of this experiment. Thus we introduce and demonstrate an operational method to use discord as a physical resource.</p>",[],False,"[""Mile Gu"", ""Helen M. Chrzanowski"", ""Syed M.

article,Local thermometry of neutral modes on the quantum Hall edge,"<p>Electrons in two dimensions and strong magnetic fields can form an insulating two-dimensional system with conducting one-dimensional channels along the edge. Electron interactions in these edges can lead to independent transport of charge and heat, even in opposite directions. Here, we heat the outer edge of such a quantum Hall system using a quantum point contact. By placing quantum dots upstream and downstream from the heater, we measure both the chemical potential and temperature of that edge to study charge and heat transport, respectively. We find that charge is transported exclusively downstream, but heat can be transported upstream when the edge has additional structure related to fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics. Surprisingly, this can occur even when the bulk is in an integer quantum Hall state and the edge contains no signatures of FQH charge transport. We also find an unexpected bulk contribution to heat transport at &#957;&#8201;=&#8201;1.</p>",[],False,"[""Vivek Venkatachalam"", ""Sean Hart"", ""Loren Pfeiffer"", ""Ken West"", ""Amir Yacoby""]","Venkatachalam, V., Hart, S., Pfeiffer, L. et al.

article,Commensurability and chaos in magnetic vortex oscillations,"<p>Magnetic vortex dynamics in thin films is characterized by gyrotropic motion, the sense of gyration depending on the vortex core polarity, which reverses when a critical velocity is reached. Although self-sustained vortex oscillations in nanoscale systems are known to be possible, the precise role of core reversal in such dynamics remains unknown. Here we report on an experimental observation of periodic core reversal during self-sustained vortex gyration in a magnetic nanocontact system. By tuning the ratio between the gyration frequency and the rate of core reversal, we show that commensurate phase-locked and incommensurate chaotic states are possible, resulting in Devil&#8217;s staircases with driving currents. These systems could have the potential to serve as tunable nanoscale radiofrequency electrical oscillators for secure communications, allowing schemes such as encryption by chaos on demand.</p>",[],False,"[""Sebastien Petit-Watelot"", ""Joo-Von Kim"", ""Antonio Ruotolo"", ""Ruben M.

article,Experimental free-energy measurements of kinetic molecular states using fluctuation theorems,"<p>Recent advances in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and single-molecule technologies have made it possible to use irreversible work measurements to extract free-energy differences associated with the mechanical (un)folding of molecules. To date, free-energy recovery has been focused on native (or equilibrium) molecular states, but free-energy measurements of kinetic states have remained unexplored. Kinetic states are metastable, finite-lifetime states that are generated dynamically, and play important roles in diverse physical processes. In biophysics, there are many examples in which these states determine the fate of molecular reactions, including protein binding, enzymatic reactions, as well as the formation of transient intermediate states during molecular-folding processes. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain free energies of kinetic states by applying extended fluctuation relations, using optical tweezers to mechanically unfold and refold deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structures exhibiting intermediate and misfolded kinetic states.</p>",[],False,"[""Anna Alemany"", ""Alessandro Mossa"", ""Ivan Junier"", ""Felix Ritort""]","Alemany, A., Mossa, A., Junier, I. et al.
