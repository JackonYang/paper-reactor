research article,Magnetism and its microscopic origin in iron-based high-temperature superconductors,"<p>High-temperature superconductivity in the iron-based materials emerges from, or sometimes coexists with, their metallic or insulating parent compound states. This is surprising, as these undoped states exhibit dramatically different antiferromagnetic spin arrangements and N&#233;el temperatures. Although there is a general consensus that magnetic interactions are important for superconductivity, much remains unknown concerning the microscopic origin of the magnetic states. In this review, we summarize the progress in this area, focusing on recent experimental and theoretical results, and their microscopic implications. We conclude that the parent compounds are in a state that is more complex than that implied by a simple Fermi surface nesting scenario, and a dual description including both itinerant and localized degrees of freedom is needed to properly describe these fascinating materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Pengcheng Dai"", ""Jiangping Hu"", ""Elbio Dagotto""]","Dai, P., Hu, J. & Dagotto, E.

article,Decrease of upper critical field with underdoping in cuprate superconductors,"<p>It is still unclear why the transition temperature T<sub>c</sub> of cuprate superconductors falls with underdoping. The doping dependence of the critical magnetic field H<sub>c2</sub> is directly relevant to this question, but different estimates of H<sub>c2</sub> are in sharp contradiction. We resolve this contradiction by tracking the characteristic field scale of superconducting fluctuations as a function of doping, via measurements of the Nernst effect in La<sub>1.8&#8722;x</sub>Eu<sub>0.2</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. H<sub>c2</sub> is found to fall with underdoping, with a minimum where stripe order is strong. The same non-monotonic behaviour is observed in the archetypal cuprate superconductor YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>y</sub>. We conclude that competing states such as stripe order weaken superconductivity and cause both H<sub>c2</sub> and T<sub>c</sub> to fall as cuprates become underdoped.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Direct mapping of the formation of a persistent spin helix,"<p>The spin&#8211;orbit interaction (SOI) in zincblende semiconductor quantum wells can be set to a symmetry point, in which spin decay is strongly suppressed for a helical spin mode. Signatures of such a persistent spin helix (PSH) have been probed using the transient spin-grating technique, but it has not yet been possible to observe the formation and the helical nature of a PSH. Here we directly map the diffusive evolution of a local spin excitation into a helical spin mode by a time-resolved and spatially resolved magneto-optical Kerr rotation technique. Depending on its in-plane direction, an external magnetic field interacts differently with the spin mode and either highlights its helical nature or destroys the SU(2) symmetry of the SOI and thus decreases the spin lifetime. All relevant SOI parameters are experimentally determined and confirmed with a numerical simulation of spin diffusion in the presence of SOI.</p>",[],False,"[""M. P. Walser"", ""C. Reichl"", ""W.

article,Dynamics of relativistic transparency and optical shuttering in expanding overdense plasmas,"<p>Overdense plasmas are usually opaque to laser light. However, when the light is of sufficient intensity to drive electrons in the plasma to near light speeds, the plasma becomes transparent. This process&#8212;known as relativistic transparency&#8212;takes just a tenth of a picosecond. Yet all studies of relativistic transparency so far have been restricted to measurements collected over timescales much longer than this, limiting our understanding of the dynamics of this process. Here we present time-resolved electric field measurements (with a temporal resolution of &#8764; 50&#8201;fs) of the light, initially reflected from, and subsequently transmitted through, an expanding overdense plasma. Our result provides insight into the dynamics of the transparent-overdense regime of relativistic plasmas, which should be useful in the development of laser-driven particle accelerators, X-ray sources and techniques for controlling the shape and contrast of intense laser pulses.</p>",[],False,"[""Sasi Palaniyappan"", ""B.
