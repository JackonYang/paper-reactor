article,Coherent multi-flavour spin dynamics in a fermionic quantum gas,"<p>Microscopic spin-interaction processes are fundamental for global static and dynamical magnetic properties of many-body systems. Quantum gases as pure and well-isolated systems offer intriguing possibilities to study basic magnetic processes including non-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we report on the realization of a well-controlled fermionic spinor gas in an optical lattice with tunable effective spin ranging from 1/2 to 9/2. We observe long-lived intrinsic spin oscillations and investigate the transition from two-body to many-body dynamics. The latter involves a complex interplay of spin and spatial degrees of freedom and implies an instability of an initially band insulating state. Using an external magnetic field we control the dimensionality of the system and tune the spin oscillations in and out of resonance. Our results open new routes to study quantum magnetism of fermionic particles beyond conventional spin 1/2 systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Jasper S.

article,Microwave electrometry with Rydberg atoms in a vapour cell using bright atomic resonances,"<p>Atom-based standards for length and time as well as other physical quantities such as magnetic fields show clear advantages by enabling stable and uniform measurements. Here we demonstrate a new method for measuring microwave (MW) electric fields based on quantum interference in a rubidium atom. Using a bright resonance prepared within an electromagnetically induced transparency window we could achieve a sensitivity of &#8764;30&#8201;&#956;V&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> and demonstrate detection of MW electric fields as small as &#8764;8&#8201;&#956;V&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with a modest set-up. The sensitivity is limited, at present, by the stability of our lasers and can be significantly improved in the future. Our method can serve as a new atom-based traceable standard for MW electrometry, with its reproducibility, accuracy and stability promising advances towards levels comparable with those attained in magnetometry at present.</p>",[],False,"[""Jonathon A.

article,An SU(6) Mott insulator of an atomic Fermi gas realized by large-spin Pomeranchuk cooling,"<p>The Hubbard model accounts for many of the diverse phenomena observed in solid-state materials, despite incorporating only nearest-neighbour hopping and on-site interactions for correlated electrons. One interesting extension to the model involves enlarging its spin symmetry to , which describes systems with orbital degeneracy. Here we report a successful formation of the SU(6) symmetric Mott-insulator state with an atomic Fermi gas of ytterbium (<sup>173</sup>Yb) atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice. In addition to the suppression of compressibility and the charge-excitation gap characteristic of a Mott-insulating phase, we reveal that the SU(6) system can achieve lower temperatures than the SU(2) state, owing to differences in the entropy carried by an isolated spin. The mechanism is analogous to Pomeranchuk cooling in solid <sup>3</sup>He and will be helpful for investigating exotic quantum phases of the SU() Hubbard system at extremely low temperatures.</p>",[],False,"[""Shintaro Taie"", ""Rekishu Yamazaki"", ""Seiji Sugawa"", ""Yoshiro Takahashi""]","Taie, S., Yamazaki, R., Sugawa, S. et al.

article,Accessing long-lived nuclear singlet states between chemically equivalent spins without breaking symmetry,"<p>Long-lived nuclear spin states could greatly enhance the applicability of hyperpolarized nuclear magnetic resonance. Using singlet states between inequivalent spin pairs has been shown to extend the signal lifetime by more than an order of magnitude compared to the spin lattice relaxation time (T<sub>1</sub>), but they have to be prevented from evolving into other states. In the most interesting case the singlet is between chemically equivalent spins, as it can then be inherently an eigenstate. However this presents major challenges in the conversion from bulk magnetization to singlet. In the only case demonstrated so far, a reversible chemical reaction to break symmetry was required. Here we present a pulse sequence technique that interconverts between singlet spin order and bulk magnetization without breaking the symmetry of the spin system. This technique is independent of field strength and is applicable to a broad range of molecules.</p>",[],False,"[""Yesu Feng"", ""Ryan M. Davis"", ""Warren S.

article,Electric-field-induced generation and reversal of ferromagnetic moment in ferrites,"<p>The prospect of controlling the magnetization (M) of a material solely with an external electric field (E) could enable the development of low-power spintronics. Although there has been some success towards this end, most approaches involve controlling interactions at the interface between two different materials rather than switching of a single bulk phase. Here we report the ability to exert complete control over the generation and reversal of the bulk spontaneous M of the single-component multiferroics RFeO<sub>3</sub> (R&#8201;=&#8201;Dy<sub>0.70</sub>Tb<sub>0.30</sub>, Dy<sub>0.75</sub>Gd<sub>0.25</sub>) with an E alone. We achieve this by controlling the anisotropic character of rare-earth magnetism and exploiting the competition between different magnetoelectric phases. We also show that whether M is reversed or retained on the E-induced polarization reversal depends on the E modulation speed. This is ascribed to the different dynamical characteristics of ferroelectric and multiferroic domain walls governed by the reversal dynamics of rare-earth moments and iron spins, respectively.</p>",[],False,"[""Yusuke Tokunaga"", ""Yasujiro Taguchi"", ""Taka-hisa Arima"", ""Yoshinori Tokura""]","Tokunaga, Y., Taguchi, Y., Arima, Th. et al.

article,Explaining fast ejections of plasma and exotic X-ray emission from the solar corona,"<p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most energetic events in the solar system and can make near-Earth space a hazardous place. However, there is still no consensus as to what physical mechanisms are responsible for these solar eruptions. Here we demonstrate a fundamental connection between the emergence of magnetic flux into the solar atmosphere and the formation of solar eruptions. We present a model of the dynamics of the solar atmosphere and inner solar wind region using a realistic representation of the electric field at the photosphere, calculated from flux-emergence computer simulations, as the boundary conditions. From this, we show how magnetic flux and helicity injection leads to the reorganization of the solar corona. We show evidence for the in&#160;situ formation of a CME plasmoid, which is independent of the emerging flux tube, and we conclusively connect this process to the formation of a hot X-ray structure.</p>",[],False,"[""Ilia I.
