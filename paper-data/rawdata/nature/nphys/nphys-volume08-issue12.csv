article,Quantum flutter of supersonic particles in one-dimensional quantum liquids,"<p>Fast obstacles in a medium are responsible for striking physical phenomena, such as aerodynamic flutter, &#268;erenkov radiation and acoustic shock waves. In a hydrodynamic picture, quantum systems exhibit analogues of these dynamical features. Here we uncover novel quantum dynamics induced by fast particles by considering impurities injected supersonically into a one-dimensional quantum liquid. We find that the injected particle never comes to a full stop, at odds with conventional expectations of relaxation. Furthermore the system excites a new type of collective mode, manifesting itself in several observable quantities, such as long-lived oscillations in the velocity of the injected particle and simultaneous oscillations of the correlation hole formed around the impurity. These features are inherently quantum-mechanical and provide an example of a dynamically formed quantum coherent state propagating through a many-body environment while maintaining its coherence. The signatures of these effects can be probed directly with existing experimental tools.</p>",,"[{'address': 'ITAMP, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA', 'authors': ['Charles J.

article,Zero-bias peaks and splitting in an Al–InAs nanowire topological superconductor as a signature of Majorana fermions,"<p>Majorana fermions are the only fermionic particles that are expected to be their own antiparticles. Although elementary particles of the Majorana type have not been identified yet, quasi-particles with Majorana-like properties, born from interacting electrons in the solid, have been predicted to exist. Here, we present thorough experimental studies, backed by numerical simulations, of a system composed of an aluminium superconductor in proximity to an indium arsenide nanowire, with the latter possessing strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting. An induced one-dimensional topological superconductor, supporting Majorana fermions at both ends, is expected to form. We concentrate on the characteristics of a distinct zero-bias conductance peak and its splitting in energy&#8212;both appearing only with a small magnetic field applied along the wire. The zero-bias conductance peak was found to be robustly tied to the Fermi energy over a wide range of system parameters. Although not providing definite proof of a Majorana state, the presented data and the simulations support its existence.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Braun Center for Submicron Research, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel', 'authors': ['Anindya Das', ',\xa0Yuval Ronen', ',\xa0Yonatan Most', ',\xa0Yuval Oreg', ',\xa0Moty Heiblum', '\xa0&\xa0Hadas Shtrikman']}]",False,"['Anindya Das', 'Yuval Ronen', 'Yonatan Most', 'Yuval Oreg', 'Moty Heiblum', 'Hadas Shtrikman']","Das, A., Ronen, Y., Most, Y. et al.

article,Strong Coulomb drag and broken symmetry in double-layer graphene,"<p>Coulomb drag is a frictional coupling between electric currents flowing in spatially separated conducting layers. It is caused by interlayer electron&#8211;electron interactions. Previously, only the regime of weak (d&#8811;l) to intermediate (d&#8764;l) coupling could be studied experimentally, where dis the interlayer separation and l is the characteristic distance between charge carriers. Here we use graphene&#8211;boron-nitride heterostructures with d down to 1&#8201;nm to probe Coulomb drag in the limit d&#8810;l such that the two Dirac liquids effectively nest within the same plane, but can still be tuned and measured independently. The strongly interacting regime reveals many unexpected features. In particular, although drag vanishes because of electron&#8211;hole symmetry when either layer is neutral, we often find drag strongest when both layers are neutral. Under this circumstance, drag is positive in zero magnetic field but changes its sign and rapidly grows in strength with field. The drag remains strong at room temperature. The broken electron&#8211;hole symmetry is attributed to mutual polarization of closely spaced interacting layers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Centre for Mesoscience and Nanotechnology, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK', 'authors': ['R.

article,Identifying topological order by entanglement entropy,"<p>Topological phases are unique states of matter that incorporate long-range quantum entanglement and host exotic excitations with fractional quantum statistics. Here we report a practical method to identify topological phases in arbitrary realistic models by accurately calculating the topological entanglement entropy using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We argue that the DMRG algorithm systematically selects a minimally entangled state from the quasi-degenerate ground states in a topological phase. This tendency explains both the success of our method and the absence of ground-state degeneracy in previous DMRG studies of topological phases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure by obtaining the topological entanglement entropy for several microscopic models, with an accuracy of the order of 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>, when the circumference of the cylinder is around ten times the correlation length. As an example, we definitively show that the ground state of the quantum S = 1/2 antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice is a topological spin liquid, and strongly constrain the conditions for identification of this phase of matter.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA', 'authors': ['Hong-Chen Jiang', '\xa0&\xa0Leon Balents']}, {'address': 'Microsoft Station Q, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, USA', 'authors': ['Zhenghan Wang']}]",False,"['Hong-Chen Jiang', 'Zhenghan Wang', 'Leon Balents']","Jiang, H., Wang, Z. & Balents, L.

article,Spin dynamics of molecular nanomagnets unravelled at atomic scale by four-dimensional inelastic neutron scattering,"<p>Molecular nanomagnets are among the first examples of finite-size spin systems and have been test beds for addressing several phenomena in quantum dynamics. In fact, for short-enough timescales the spin wavefunctions evolve coherently according to an appropriate spin Hamiltonian, which can be engineered to meet specific requirements. Unfortunately, so far it has been impossible to determine these spin dynamics directly. Here we show that recently developed instrumentation yields the four-dimensional inelastic-neutron scattering function in vast portions of reciprocal space and enables the spin dynamics to be determined directly. We use the Cr<sub>8</sub> antiferromagnetic ring as a benchmark to demonstrate the potential of this approach which allows us, for example, to examine how quantum fluctuations propagate along the ring or to test the degree of validity of the N&#233;el-vector-tunnelling framework.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut Laue-Langevin, BP 156, 6 rue Jules Horowitz, 38042 Grenoble Cedex 9, France', 'authors': ['Michael L.

This concept, known as Anderson localization, has been tested in electronic, optical, acoustic and matter wave systems, which have all shown that disorder generally works to arrest transport. One major condition is common to all work on Anderson localization: for localization to take place, the underlying potential must be constant in time (frozen). Otherwise, if the disorder is dynamically evolving, localization breaks down and diffusive transport is expected to prevail. However, it seems natural to ask: can disorder increase the transport rate beyond diffusion, possibly even beyond ballistic transport? Here, we use a paraxial optical setting as a model system, and demonstrate experimentally and numerically that an evolving random potential gives rise to stochastic acceleration, which causes an initial wave packet to expand at a rate faster than ballistic, while its transverse momentum spectrum continuously expands. We discuss the universal aspects of the phenomenon relevant for all wave systems containing disorder.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics Department and Solid State Institute, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel', 'authors': ['Liad Levi', ',\xa0Yevgeny Krivolapov', ',\xa0Shmuel Fishman', '\xa0&\xa0Mordechai Segev']}]",False,"['Liad Levi', 'Yevgeny Krivolapov', 'Shmuel Fishman', 'Mordechai Segev']","Levi, L., Krivolapov, Y., Fishman, S. et al.

article,Production of spin-controlled rare isotope beams,"<p>The degree of freedom of spin in quantum systems serves as an unparalleled laboratory where intriguing quantum physical properties can be observed, and the ability to control spin is a powerful tool in physics research. We propose a method for controlling spin in a system of rare isotopes which takes advantage of the mechanism of the projectile fragmentation reaction combined with the momentum-dispersion matching technique. The present method was verified in an experiment at the RIKEN RI Beam Factory, in which a degree of alignment of 8% was achieved for the spin of a rare isotope <sup>32</sup>Al. The figure of merit for the present method was found to be greater than that of the conventional method by a factor of more than 50.</p>",,"[{'address': 'RIKEN Nishina Center, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan', 'authors': ['Yuichi Ichikawa', ',\xa0Hideki Ueno', ',\xa0Daisuke Kameda', ',\xa0Hiroshi Watanabe', ',\xa0Nori Aoi', ',\xa0Naoki Fukuda', ',\xa0Naoto Inabe', ',\xa0Masayasu Ishihara', ',\xa0Toshiyuki Kubo', ',\xa0Tetsuya Ohnishi', '\xa0&\xa0Hiroyuki Takeda']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Oh-okayama, Meguro, Tokyo 152-8551, Japan', 'authors': ['Yuji Ishii', ',\xa0Koichiro Asahi', ',\xa0Hironori Hayashi', ',\xa0Hiroaki Iijima', ',\xa0Takeshi Inoue', ',\xa0Tsubasa Nanao', ',\xa0Kunifumi Suzuki', '\xa0&\xa0Masato Tsuchiya']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Tokyo Metropolitan University, 1-1 Minami-Ohsawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0397, Japan', 'authors': ['Takeshi Furukawa']}, {'address': 'Research Core for Extreme Quantum World, Okayama University, 3-1-1 Tsushimanaka, Kita, Okayama 700-8530, Japan', 'authors': ['Akihiro Yoshimi']}, {'address': 'Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, BG-1784, Sofia, Bulgaria', 'authors': ['Dimiter L.

article,Super-elastic collision of large-scale magnetized plasmoids in the heliosphere,"<p>A super-elastic collision is an unusual process in which some mechanism causes the kinetic energy of the system to increase. Most studies have focused on solid-like objects, and have rarely considered gases or liquids, as the collision of these is primarily a mixing process. However, magnetized plasmoids are different from ordinary gases&#8212;as cross-field diffusion is effectively prohibited&#8212;but it remains unclear how they behave during a collision. Here we present a comprehensive picture of a unique collision between two coronal mass ejections in the heliosphere, which are the largest magnetized plasmoids erupting from the Sun. Our analysis reveals that these two magnetized plasmoids collided as if they were solid-like objects, with a likelihood of 73% that the collision was super-elastic. The total kinetic energy of the plasmoid system increased by about 6.6% through the collision, significantly influencing its dynamics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences, CAS Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China', 'authors': ['Chenglong Shen', ',\xa0Yuming Wang', ',\xa0Shui Wang', ',\xa0Rui Liu', ',\xa0Bin Miao', ',\xa0Pinzhong Ye', ',\xa0Jiajia Liu', '\xa0&\xa0Zhenjun Zhou']}, {'address': 'Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA', 'authors': ['Ying Liu']}, {'address': 'State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China', 'authors': ['Ying Liu']}, {'address': 'Space Science Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington DC 20375, USA', 'authors': ['Angelos Vourlidas']}]",False,"['Chenglong Shen', 'Yuming Wang', 'Shui Wang', 'Ying Liu', 'Rui Liu', 'Angelos Vourlidas', 'Bin Miao', 'Pinzhong Ye', 'Jiajia Liu', 'Zhenjun Zhou']","Shen, C., Wang, Y., Wang, S. et al.
