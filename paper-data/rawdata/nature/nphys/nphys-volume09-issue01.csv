review article,Quantum biology,"<p>Recent evidence suggests that a variety of organisms may harness some of the unique features of quantum mechanics to gain a biological advantage. These features go beyond trivial quantum effects and may include harnessing quantum coherence on physiologically important timescales. In this brief review we summarize the latest results for non-trivial quantum effects in photosynthetic light harvesting, avian magnetoreception and several other candidates for functional quantum biology. We present both the evidence for and arguments against there being a functional role for quantum coherence in these systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Neill Lambert"", ""Yueh-Nan Chen"", ""Yuan-Chung Cheng"", ""Che-Ming Li"", ""Guang-Yin Chen"", ""Franco Nori""]","Lambert, N., Chen, YN., Cheng, YC. et al.

article,Close relationship between superconductivity and the bosonic mode in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and Na(Fe0.975Co0.025)As,"<p>Since the discovery in 2008 of high-temperature superconductivity in the iron pnictides and chalcogenides, a central issue has been the microscopic origin of the superconducting pairing. In particular, it remains unclear whether there is a bosonic mode from the tunnelling spectrum, which has a close and universal relationship with superconductivity as well as with the observed spin excitation. Here, on the basis of measurements of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we show clear evidence of a bosonic mode with energy identical to that of the neutron spin resonance in two completely different systems, Ba<sub>0.6</sub>K<sub>0.4</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub> and Na(Fe<sub>0.975</sub>Co<sub>0.025</sub>)As, with different superconducting transition temperatures. In both samples, the superconducting coherence peaks and the mode feature vanish simultaneously inside the vortex core or above the transition temperature T<sub>c</sub>, indicating a close relationship between superconductivity and the bosonic mode. Our data also demonstrate a universal ratio between the mode energy and superconducting transition temperature, that is &#937;/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>c</sub>&#8776;4.3, which underlines the unconventional nature of superconductivity in the iron pnictide superconductors.</p>",[],False,"[""Zhenyu Wang"", ""Huan Yang"", ""Delong Fang"", ""Bing Shen"", ""Qiang-Hua Wang"", ""Lei Shan"", ""Chenglin Zhang"", ""Pengcheng Dai"", ""Hai-Hu Wen""]","Wang, Z., Yang, H., Fang, D. et al.

article,A wide-bandgap metal–semiconductor–metal nanostructure made entirely from graphene,"<p>Present methods for producing semiconducting&#8211;metallic graphene networks suffer from stringent lithographic demands, process-induced disorder in the graphene, and scalability issues. Here we demonstrate a one-dimensional metallic&#8211;semiconducting&#8211;metallic junction made entirely from graphene. Our technique takes advantage of the inherent, atomically ordered, substrate&#8211;graphene interaction when graphene is grown on SiC, in this case patterned SiC steps, and does not rely on chemical functionalization or finite-size patterning. This scalable bottom-up approach allows us to produce a semiconducting graphene strip whose width is precisely defined to within a few graphene lattice constants, a level of precision beyond modern lithographic limits, and which is robust enough that there is little variation in the electronic band structure across thousands of ribbons. The semiconducting graphene has a topographically defined few-nanometre-wide region with an energy gap greater than 0.5&#8201;eV in an otherwise continuous metallic graphene sheet.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Wave propagation control at the deep subwavelength scale in metamaterials,"<p>The ability to control wave propagation is of fundamental interest in many areas of physics. Photonic crystals proved very useful for this purpose but, because they are based on Bragg interferences, these artificial media require structures with large dimensions. Metamaterials, on the other hand, can exhibit very deep subwavelength spatial scales. In general they are studied for their bulk effective properties that lead to effects such as negative refraction. Here we go beyond this effective medium paradigm and we use a microscopic approach to study metamaterials based on resonant unit cells. We show that we can tailor unit cells locally to shape the flow of waves at deep subwavelength scales. We validate our approach in experiments with both electromagnetic and acoustic waves in the metre range demonstrating cavities, waveguides, corners and splitters with centimetre-scale dimensions, an order of magnitude smaller than previous proposals.</p>",[],False,"[""Fabrice Lemoult"", ""Nad\u00e8ge Kaina"", ""Mathias Fink"", ""Geoffroy Lerosey""]","Lemoult, F., Kaina, N., Fink, M. et al.
