article,Efimov effect in quantum magnets,"<p>Physics is said to be universal when it emerges regardless of the underlying microscopic details. A prominent example is the Efimov effect, which predicts the emergence of an infinite tower of three-body bound states obeying discrete scale invariance when the particles interact resonantly. Because of its universality and peculiarity, the Efimov effect has been the subject of extensive research in chemical, atomic, nuclear and particle physics for decades. Here we employ an anisotropic Heisenberg model to show that collective excitations in quantum magnets (magnons) also exhibit the Efimov effect. We locate anisotropy-induced two-magnon resonances, compute binding energies of three magnons and find that they fit into the universal scaling law. We propose several approaches to experimentally realize the Efimov effect in quantum magnets, where the emergent Efimov states of magnons can be observed with commonly used spectroscopic measurements. Our study thus opens up new avenues for universal few-body physics in condensed matter systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Yusuke Nishida"", ""Yasuyuki Kato"", ""Cristian D.

article,The space group classification of topological band-insulators,"<p>Topological band-insulators (TBIs) are bulk insulating materials, which in the presence of time-reversal symmetry feature topologically protected metallic states on their surface or edge. They have recently been discovered in two- and three-dimensional materials with a strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. These unusual states of quantum matter may host Majorana fermions and provide the condensed-matter realization of the exotic theta-vacuum. The existing classification of TBIs departs from time-reversal symmetry, but the role of the crystal-lattice symmetries in the physics of these topological states has remained elusive. Here we provide the classification of TBIs protected not only by time-reversal, but also by crystalline symmetries. We find three broad classes of topological states: &#915; states robust against general time-reversal invariant perturbations; translationally active states protected from elastic scattering, but susceptible to topological crystalline disorder; valley topological insulators sensitive to the effects of non-topological and crystalline disorder. These three classes give rise to 18 different two-dimensional, and, at least 70 three-dimensional TBIs, opening up a route for the systematic search for new types of TBIs.</p>",[],False,"[""Robert-Jan Slager"", ""Andrej Mesaros"", ""Vladimir Juri\u010di\u0107"", ""Jan Zaanen""]","Slager, RJ., Mesaros, A., Juričić, V. et al.

article,Photocurrent measurements of supercollision cooling in graphene,"<p>The cooling of hot electrons in graphene is the critical process underlying the operation of exciting new graphene-based optoelectronic and plasmonic devices, but the nature of this cooling is controversial. We extract the hot-electron cooling rate near the Fermi level by using graphene as a novel photothermal thermometer that measures the electron temperature (T(t)) as it cools dynamically. We find the photocurrent generated from graphene p&#8211;n&#160;junctions is well described by the energy dissipation rate CdT/dt&#8201;=&#8201;&#8722;A(T<sup>3</sup>&#8722;T<sub>l</sub><sup>3</sup>), where the heat capacity is C&#8201;=&#8201;&#945; T and T<sub>l</sub> is the base lattice temperature. These results are in disagreement with predictions of electron&#8211;phonon emission in a disorder-free graphene system, but in excellent quantitative agreement with recent predictions of a disorder-enhanced supercollision cooling mechanism. We find that the supercollision model provides a complete and unified picture of energy loss near the Fermi level over the wide range of electronic (15 to &#8764; 3,000&#8201;K) and lattice (10&#8211;295&#8201;K) temperatures investigated.</p>",[],False,"[""Matt W.

article,Supercollision cooling in undoped graphene,"<p>Carrier mobility in solids is generally limited by electron-impurity or electron&#8211;phonon scattering, depending on the most frequently occurring event. Three-body collisions between carriers and both phonons and impurities are rare; they are denoted supercollisions. Elusive in electronic transport they should emerge in relaxation processes as they allow for larger energy transfers. This is the case in undoped graphene, where the small Fermi surface drastically restricts the allowed phonon energy in ordinary collisions. Using electrical heating and sensitive noise thermometry we report on supercollision cooling in diffusive monolayer graphene. At low carrier density and high phonon temperature the Joule power P obeys a PT<sub>e</sub><sup>3</sup> law as a function of electronic temperature T<sub>e</sub>. It overrules the linear law expected for ordinary collisions which has recently been observed in resistivity measurements. The cubic law is characteristic of supercollisions and departs from the T<sub>e</sub><sup>4</sup> dependence recently reported for doped graphene below the Bloch&#8211;Gr&#252;neisen temperature. These supercollisions are important for applications of graphene in bolometry and photo-detection.</p>",[],False,"[""A. C. Betz"", ""S. H. Jhang"", ""E. Pallecchi"", ""R. Ferreira"", ""G.

article,The role of non-equilibrium vibrational structures in electronic coherence and recoherence in pigment–protein complexes,"<p>Recent observations of oscillatory features in the optical response of photosynthetic complexes have revealed evidence for surprisingly long-lasting electronic coherences which can coexist with energy transport. These observations have ignited multidisciplinary interest in the role of quantum effects in biological systems, including the fundamental question of how electronic coherence can survive in biological surroundings. Here we show that the non-trivial spectral structures of protein fluctuations can generate non-equilibrium processes that lead to the spontaneous creation and sustenance of electronic coherence, even at physiological temperatures. Developing new advanced simulation tools to treat these effects, we provide a firm microscopic basis to successfully reproduce the experimentally observed coherence times in the Fenna&#8211;Matthews&#8211;Olson complex, and illustrate how detailed quantum modelling and simulation can shed further light on a wide range of other non-equilibrium processes which may be important in different photosynthetic systems.</p>",[],False,"[""A.
