article,A large-scale quantum simulator on a diamond surface at room temperature,"<p>Strongly correlated quantum many-body systems may exhibit exotic phases, such as spin liquids and supersolids. Although their numerical simulation becomes intractable for as few as 50 particles, quantum simulators offer a route to overcome this computational barrier. However, proposed realizations either require stringent conditions such as low temperature/ultra-high vacuum, or are extremely hard to scale. Here, we propose a new solid-state architecture for a scalable quantum simulator that consists of strongly interacting nuclear spins attached to the diamond surface. Initialization, control and read-out of this quantum simulator can be accomplished with nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted in diamond. The system can be engineered to simulate a wide variety of strongly correlated spin models. Owing to the superior coherence time of nuclear spins and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, our proposal offers new opportunities towards large-scale quantum simulation at ambient conditions of temperature and pressure.</p>",[],False,"[""Jianming Cai"", ""Alex Retzker"", ""Fedor Jelezko"", ""Martin B.

article,Linked attosecond phase interferometry for molecular frame measurements,"<p>High-harmonic spectroscopy uses attosecond techniques to measure single-atom or molecule photorecombination cross-sections. Whereas the amplitude of the extreme-ultraviolet light is easily measurable, the phase is more challenging to access. However, the phase contains information necessary for tomographic imaging of the molecular orbital wavefunction with attosecond&#8211;&#229;ngstr&#246;m resolution. Present techniques cannot simultaneously measure the phase as a function of molecular angle and photon frequency, which is necessary for a full reconstruction of the wavefunction. We overcome this limitation with an all-optical method that does not require any ad hoc assumptions about the phase. We apply it to record the full phase map of aligned bromine molecules relative to reference xenon atoms. It allows us to resolve, both spectrally and angularly, the participation of multiple molecular orbitals, and infer a phase of ionization. This method opens a path to time-resolved molecular orbital tomography.</p>",[],False,"[""J. B. Bertrand"", ""H. J. W\u00f6rner"", ""P. Sali\u00e8res"", ""D. M. Villeneuve"", ""P. B.

article,"Slowing, advancing and switching of microwave signals using circuit nanoelectromechanics","<p>The parametric coupling of electromagnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom gives rise to a host of optomechanical phenomena. Examples include quantum-limited displacement measurements, sideband cooling or amplification of mechanical motion. Likewise, this interaction provides mechanically mediated functionality for the processing of electromagnetic signals, such as microwave amplification. Here, we couple a superconducting niobium coplanar waveguide cavity to a nanomechanical oscillator, and demonstrate all-microwave field-controlled tunable slowing and advancing of microwave signals, with millisecond distortion-free delay and negligible losses. This is realized by using electromechanically induced transparency, an effect analogous to electromagnetically induced transparency in atomic physics. Moreover, by temporally modulating the electromechanical coupling and correspondingly the transparency window, switching of microwave signals is demonstrated and its temporal dynamics investigated. The exquisite temporal control gained over the electromechanical coupling provides the basis for realizing advanced protocols for storage of both classical and quantum microwave signals.</p>",[],False,"[""X.

article,A compact laser-driven plasma accelerator for megaelectronvolt-energy neutral atoms,"<p>Tremendous strides have been made in charged-particle acceleration using intense, ultrashort laser pulses. Accelerating neutral atoms is an important complementary technology because such particles are unaffected by electric and magnetic fields and can thus penetrate deeper into a target than ions. However, compact laser-based accelerators for neutral atoms are limited at best to millielectronvolt energies. Here, we report the generation of megaelectronvolt-energy argon atoms from an optical-field-ionized dense nanocluster ensemble. Measurements reveal that nearly every laser-accelerated ion is converted to an energetic neutral atom as a result of highly efficient electron transfer from Rydberg excited clusters, within a sheath around the laser focus. This process, although optimal in nanoclusters, is generic and adaptable to most laser-produced plasmas. Such compact laser-driven energetic neutral atom sources could have applications in fast atom lithography for surface science and tokamak diagnostics in plasma technology.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

article,Spontaneous synchrony in power-grid networks,"<p>An imperative condition for the functioning of a power-grid network is that its power generators remain synchronized. Disturbances can prompt desynchronization, which is a process that has been involved in large power outages. Here we derive a condition under which the desired synchronous state of a power grid is stable, and use this condition to identify tunable parameters of the generators that are determinants of spontaneous synchronization. Our analysis gives rise to an approach to specify parameter assignments that can enhance synchronization of any given network, which we demonstrate for a selection of both test systems and real power grids. These findings may be used to optimize stability and help devise new control schemes, thus offering an additional layer of protection and contributing to the development of smart grids that can recover from failures in real time.</p>",[],False,"[""Adilson E.
