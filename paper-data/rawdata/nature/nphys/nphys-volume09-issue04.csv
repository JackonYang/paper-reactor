article,Quantum dynamics of a mobile spin impurity,"<p>One of the elementary processes in quantum magnetism is the propagation of spin excitations. Here we study the quantum dynamics of a deterministically created spin-impurity atom, as it propagates in a one-dimensional lattice system. We probe the spatial probability distribution of the impurity at different times using single-site-resolved imaging of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. In the Mott-insulating regime, the quantum-coherent propagation of a magnetic excitation in the Heisenberg model can be observed using a post-selection technique. Extending the study to the superfluid regime of the bath, we quantitatively determine how the bath affects the motion of the impurity, showing evidence of polaronic behaviour. The experimental data agree with theoretical predictions, allowing us to determine the effect of temperature on the impurity motion. Our results provide a new approach to studying quantum magnetism, mobile impurities in quantum fluids and polarons in lattice systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Takeshi Fukuhara"", ""Adrian Kantian"", ""Manuel Endres"", ""Marc Cheneau"", ""Peter Schau\u00df"", ""Sebastian Hild"", ""David Bellem"", ""Ulrich Schollw\u00f6ck"", ""Thierry Giamarchi"", ""Christian Gross"", ""Immanuel Bloch"", ""Stefan Kuhr""]","Fukuhara, T., Kantian, A., Endres, M. et al.

article,Spin-dependent trapping of electrons at spinterfaces,"<p>Hybrid ferromagnetic metal/organic interfaces&#8212;also known as spinterfaces&#8212;can exhibit highly efficient spin-filtering properties and therefore present a promising class of materials for the future development of new spintronic devices. Advancing the field depends critically on elucidating the fundamental microscopic processes that eventually determine the spin-filtering properties in such hybrid structures. Here, we study the femtosecond spin dynamics at the prototypical interface between cobalt and the metalorganic complex tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium. To disentangle the microscopic origin of spin filtering, we optically generate a transient spin polarization in a well-defined hybrid interface state that we follow with a spin-resolved real-time pump&#8211;probe two-photon photoemission experiment. We find that the electrons are trapped at the interface in a spin-dependent manner for a surprisingly long time of the order of 0.5&#8211;1&#8201;ps. We conclude that ferromagnetic metal/organic interfaces act as spin filters because electrons are trapped in hybrid interface states by spin-dependent confining potentials.</p>",[],False,"[""Sabine Steil"", ""Nicolas Gro\u00dfmann"", ""Martin Laux"", ""Andreas Ruffing"", ""Daniel Steil"", ""Martin Wiesenmayer"", ""Stefan Mathias"", ""Oliver L.

article,Photoexcitation cascade and multiple hot-carrier generation in graphene,"<p>The conversion of light into free electron&#8211;hole pairs constitutes the key process in the fields of photodetection and photovoltaics. The efficiency of this process depends on the competition of different relaxation pathways and can be greatly enhanced when photoexcited carriers do not lose energy as heat, but instead transfer their excess energy into the production of additional electron&#8211;hole pairs through carrier&#8211;carrier scattering processes. Here we use optical pump&#8211;terahertz probe measurements to probe different pathways contributing to the ultrafast energy relaxation of photoexcited carriers. Our results indicate that carrier&#8211;carrier scattering is highly efficient, prevailing over optical-phonon emission in a wide range of photon wavelengths and leading to the production of secondary hot electrons originating from the conduction band. As hot electrons in graphene can drive currents, multiple hot-carrier generation makes graphene a promising material for highly efficient broadband extraction of light energy into electronic degrees of freedom, enabling high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</p>",[],False,"[""K.

article,Creation and dynamics of knotted vortices,"<p>Knots and links have been conjectured to play a fundamental role in a wide range of physical fields, including plasmas and fluids, both quantum and classical. In fluids, the fundamental knottedness-carrying excitations occur in the form of linked and knotted vortex loops, which have been conjectured to exist for over a century. Although they have been the subject of considerable theoretical study, their creation in the laboratory has remained an outstanding experimental goal. Here we report the creation of isolated trefoil vortex knots and pairs of linked vortex rings in water using a new method of accelerating specially shaped hydrofoils. Using a high-speed scanning tomography apparatus, we measure their three-dimensional topological and geometrical evolution in detail. In both cases we observe that the linked vortices stretch themselves and then deform&#8212;as dictated by their geometrically determined energy&#8212;towards a series of local vortex reconnections. This work establishes the existence and dynamics of knotted vortices in real fluids.</p>",[],False,"[""Dustin Kleckner"", ""William T. M. Irvine""]","Kleckner, D., Irvine, W.
