article,Interaction-driven localization in holography,"<p>Interaction-driven charge localization across a quantum phase transition involves a fundamental rearrangement of the low-energy degrees of freedom. This fact challenges weakly interacting quasiparticle descriptions of the physics. The canonical example of such localization is the Mott transition. Here, we present a localization mechanism distinct from &#8216;Mottness&#8217;, which employs strong interactions in an essential way. Our mechanism allows anisotropic localization: phases can arise that are insulating in some directions and metallic in others. The central observation is that localization occurs if an operator that breaks translation invariance, a &#8216;generalized Umklapp&#8217; operator, becomes relevant in the effective low-energy theory. This does not occur at weak coupling. We realize such localization in a strongly interacting theory described by means of the holographic correspondence. Our model captures key features of metal&#8211;insulator transitions including major spectral weight transfer and bad (incoherent) metallic behaviour in the vicinity of the transition. The localized phase has a power law gap in the optical conductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Aristomenis Donos"", ""Sean A. Hartnoll""]","Donos, A., Hartnoll, S.

article,Spontaneous creation of Kibble–Zurek solitons in a Bose–Einstein condensate,"<p>When a system crosses a second-order phase transition on a finite timescale, spontaneous symmetry breaking can cause the development of domains with independent order parameters, which then grow and approach each other creating boundary defects. This is known as the Kibble&#8211;Zurek mechanism. Originally introduced in cosmology, it applies to both classical and quantum phase transitions, in a wide variety of physical systems. Here we report on the spontaneous creation of solitons in Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates through the Kibble&#8211;Zurek mechanism. We measure the power-law dependence of defect number on the quench time, and show that lower atomic densities enhance defect formation.

article,Control of the metal–insulator transition in vanadium dioxide by modifying orbital occupancy,"<p>External control of the conductivity of correlated oxides is one of the most promising schemes for realizing energy-efficient electronic devices. Vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>), an archetypal correlated oxide compound, undergoes a temperature-driven metal&#8211;insulator transition near room temperature with a concomitant change in crystal symmetry. Here, we show that the metal&#8211;insulator transition temperature of thin VO<sub>2</sub>(001) films can be changed continuously from &#8764;285 to &#8764;345&#8201;K by varying the thickness of the RuO<sub>2</sub> buffer layer (resulting in different epitaxial strains). Using strain-, polarization- and temperature-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in combination with X-ray diffraction and electronic transport measurements, we demonstrate that the transition temperature and the structural distortion across the transition depend on the orbital occupancy in the metallic state. Our findings open up the possibility of controlling the conductivity in atomically thin VO<sub>2</sub> layers by manipulating the orbital occupancy by, for example, heterostructural engineering.</p>",[],False,"[""Nagaphani B.

article,The extreme vulnerability of interdependent spatially embedded networks,"<p>Recent studies show that in interdependent networks a very small failure in one network may lead to catastrophic consequences. Above a critical fraction of interdependent nodes, even a single node failure can invoke cascading failures that may abruptly fragment the system, whereas below this critical dependency a failure of a few nodes leads only to a small amount of damage to the system. So far, research has focused on interdependent random networks without space limitations. However, many real systems, such as power grids and the Internet, are not random but are spatially embedded. Here we analytically and numerically study the stability of interdependent spatially embedded networks modelled as lattice networks. Surprisingly, we find that in lattice systems, in contrast to non-embedded systems, there is no critical dependency and any small fraction of interdependent nodes leads to an abrupt collapse. We show that this extreme vulnerability of very weakly coupled lattices is a consequence of the critical exponent describing the percolation transition of a single lattice.</p>",[],False,"[""Amir Bashan"", ""Yehiel Berezin"", ""Sergey V.

article,Universality in network dynamics,"<p>Despite significant advances in characterizing the structural properties of complex networks, a mathematical framework that uncovers the universal properties of the interplay between the topology and the dynamics of complex systems continues to elude us. Here we develop a self-consistent theory of dynamical perturbations in complex systems, allowing us to systematically separate the contribution of the network topology and dynamics. The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the system&#8217;s response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the system&#8217;s dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the system&#8217;s dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""Baruch Barzel"", ""Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si""]","Barzel, B., Barabási, AL.
