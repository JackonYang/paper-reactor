article,An area law for entanglement from exponential decay of correlations,"<p>Area laws for entanglement in quantum many-body systems give useful information about their low-temperature behaviour and are tightly connected to the possibility of good numerical simulations. An intuition from quantum many-body physics suggests that an area law should hold whenever there is exponential decay of correlations in the system, a property found, for instance, in non-critical phases of matter. However, the existence of quantum data-hiding states&#8212;that is, states having very small correlations, yet a volume scaling of entanglement&#8212;was believed to be a serious obstruction to such an implication. Here we prove that notwithstanding the phenomenon of data hiding, one-dimensional quantum many-body states satisfying exponential decay of correlations always fulfil an area law. To obtain this result we combine several recent advances in quantum information theory, thus showing the usefulness of the field for addressing problems in other areas of physics.</p>",[],False,"[""Fernando G.

article,Experimental verification of quantum computation,"<p>Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speed-ups over their classical counterparts and to solve problems intractable for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum computation opens up fundamental questions, among them the issue of whether quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computation. We show, in theory and experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced here uses the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the verifier is required only to generate single qubits and transmit them to the quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the verifier can test the computer&#8217;s ability to perform quantum computation.</p>",[],False,"[""Stefanie Barz"", ""Joseph F.

article,Observation of Majorana quantum critical behaviour in a resonant level coupled to a dissipative environment,"<p>A quantum phase transition is an abrupt change between two distinct ground states of a many-body system, driven by an external parameter. In the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP) where the transition occurs, a new phase may emerge that is determined by quantum fluctuations and is very different from either phase. In particular, a conducting system may exhibit non-Fermi-liquid behaviour. Although this scenario is well established theoretically, controllable experimental realizations are rare. Here, we experimentally investigate the nature of the QCP in a simple nanoscale system&#8212;a spin-polarized resonant level coupled to dissipative contacts. We fine-tune the system to the QCP, realized exactly on-resonance and when the coupling between the level and the two contacts is symmetric. Several anomalous transport scaling laws are demonstrated, including a striking non-Fermi-liquid scattering rate at the QCP, indicating fractionalization of the resonant level into two Majorana quasiparticles.</p>",[],False,"[""H.

article,Engineering Ising-XY spin-models in a triangular lattice using tunable artificial gauge fields,"<p>Magnetism plays a key role in modern science and technology, but still many open questions arise from the interplay of magnetic many-body interactions. Deeper insight into complex magnetic behaviour and the nature of magnetic phase transitions can be obtained from, for example, model systems of coupled XY and Ising spins. Here, we report on the experimental realization of such a coupled system with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. This is accomplished by imposing an artificial gauge field on the neutral atoms, which acts on them as a magnetic field does on charged particles. As a result, the atoms show persistent circular currents, the direction of which provides an Ising variable. On this, the tunable staggered gauge field, generated by a periodic driving of the lattice, acts as a longitudinal field. Further, the superfluid ground state presents strong analogies with the paradigm example of the fully frustrated XY model on a triangular lattice.</p>",[],False,"[""J. Struck"", ""M.

article,Vibrational and electronic dynamics of nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond revealed by two-dimensional ultrafast spectroscopy,"<p>The optical and material properties of negatively charged nitrogen&#8211;vacancy (NV) centres in diamond make them attractive for applications ranging from quantum information to electromagnetic sensing. These properties are strongly dependent on the vibrational manifold associated with the centre, which determines phenomena associated with decoherence, relaxation and spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Despite its paramount importance in tuning these properties, the role of the vibrational bath and its effect on the electronic-state dynamics of NV centres in diamond is not fully understood. To elucidate the role of the bath, we present two-dimensional electronic spectroscopic studies of ensembles of negatively charged NV defect centres in diamond (NVD). We observe picosecond non-radiative relaxation within the phonon sideband and find that strongly coupled local modes dominate the vibrational bath. These findings provide a starting point for new insights into dephasing, spin addressing and relaxation in NVD with broad implications for magnetometry, quantum information, nanophotonics, sensing and ultrafast spectroscopy.</p>",[],False,"[""V.
