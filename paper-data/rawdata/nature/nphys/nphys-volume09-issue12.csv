article,Direct measurement of the Zak phase in topological Bloch bands,"<p>Geometric phases that characterize the topological properties of Bloch bands play a fundamental role in the band theory of solids. Here we report on the measurement of the geometric phase acquired by cold atoms moving in one-dimensional optical lattices. Using a combination of Bloch oscillations and Ramsey interferometry, we extract the Zak phase&#8212;the Berry phase gained during the adiabatic motion of a particle across the Brillouin zone&#8212;which can be viewed as an invariant characterizing the topological properties of the band. For a dimerized lattice, which models polyacetylene, we measure a difference of the Zak phase &#948; &#966;<sub>Zak</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;0.97(2)&#960; for the two possible polyacetylene phases with different dimerization. The two dimerized phases therefore belong to different topological classes, such that for a filled band, domain walls have fractional quantum numbers. Our work establishes a new general approach for probing the topological structure of Bloch bands inoptical lattices.</p>",[],False,"[""Marcos Atala"", ""Monika Aidelsburger"", ""Julio T.

article,Spintronic magnetic anisotropy,"<p>Superparamagnetism of magnetic adatoms and molecules&#8212;preferential alignment of their spins along an easy axis&#8212;is a useful effect for nanoscale applications as it prevents undesired spin reversal. The underlying magnetic anisotropy barrier&#8212;a quadrupolar energy splitting&#8212;originates from spin&#8211;orbit interaction and can nowadays be probed by electronic transport measurements. Here we predict that in a much broader class of systems, quantum dots with spins larger than 1/2, superparamagnetism can arise without spin&#8211;orbit interaction: by attaching them to ferromagnets, a quadrupolar spintronic exchange field is generated locally. It is observable by means of conductance measurements and leads to enhanced spin filtering even in a state with zero average spin. Analogously to the spintronic dipolar exchange field, giving rise to a local spin torque, the effect is susceptible to electric control and increases with tunnel coupling as well as with spin polarization.</p>",[],False,"[""Maciej Misiorny"", ""Michael Hell"", ""Maarten R.

article,Thermal nonlinearities in a nanomechanical oscillator,"<p>Nano- and micromechanical oscillators with high quality (Q)-factors have gained much attention for their potential application as ultrasensitive detectors. In contrast to micro-fabricated devices, optically trapped nanoparticles in vacuum do not suffer from clamping losses, hence leading to much larger Q-factors. We find that for a levitated nanoparticle the thermal energy suffices to drive the motion of the nanoparticle into the nonlinear regime. First, we experimentally measure and fully characterize the frequency fluctuations originating from thermal motion and nonlinearities. Second, we demonstrate that feedback cooling can be used to mitigate these fluctuations. The high level of control allows us to fully exploit the force-sensing capabilities of the nanoresonator. Our approach offers a force sensitivity of 20&#8201;zN&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>, which is the highest value reported so far at room temperature, sufficient to sense ultraweak interactions, such as non-Newtonian gravity-like forces.</p>",[],False,"[""Jan Gieseler"", ""Lukas Novotny"", ""Romain Quidant""]","Gieseler, J., Novotny, L. & Quidant, R.

article,Quasiperiodic acceleration of electrons by a plasmoid-driven shock in the solar atmosphere,"<p>Cosmic rays and solar energetic particles may be accelerated to relativistic energies by shock waves in astrophysical plasmas. On the Sun, shocks and particle acceleration are often associated with the eruption of magnetized plasmoids, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, the physical relationship between CMEs and shock particle acceleration is not well understood. Here, we use extreme ultraviolet, radio and white-light imaging of a solar eruptive event on 22 September 2011 to show that a CME-induced shock (Alfv&#233;n Mach number ) was coincident with a coronal wave and an intense metric radio burst generated by intermittent acceleration of electrons to kinetic energies of 2&#8211;46&#8201;keV (0.1&#8211;0.4&#8201;c). Our observations show that plasmoid-driven quasiperpendicular shocks are capable of producing quasiperiodic acceleration of electrons, an effect consistent with a turbulent or rippled plasma shock surface.</p>",[],False,"[""Eoin P.

article,A long-pulse high-confinement plasma regime in the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak,"<p>High-performance and long-pulse operation is a crucial goal of current magnetic fusion research. Here, we demonstrate a high-confinement plasma regime known as an H-mode with a record pulse length of over 30&#8201;s in the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak sustained by lower hybrid wave current drive (LHCD) with advanced lithium wall conditioning. We find that LHCD provides a flexible boundary control for a ubiquitous edge instability in H-mode plasmas known as an edge-localized mode, which leads to a marked reduction in the heat load on the vessel wall compared with standard edge-localized modes. LHCD also induces edge plasma ergodization that broadens the heat deposition footprint. The heat transport caused by this ergodization can be actively controlled by regulating the edge plasma conditions. This potentially offers a new means for heat-flux control, which is a key issue for next-step fusion development.</p>",[],False,"[""J. Li"", ""H. Y. Guo"", ""B. N. Wan"", ""X. Z. Gong"", ""Y. F.
