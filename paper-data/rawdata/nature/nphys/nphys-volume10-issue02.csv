review article,What drives nematic order in iron-based superconductors?,"<p>Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the x and y directions in the iron plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of a regular structural transition or as the result of an electronically driven instability &#8212; in particular, orbital order or spin-driven Ising-nematic order. The latter is a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. Symmetry dictates that the development of one of these orders immediately induces the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of the &#8216;chicken and egg problem&#8217;. In this Review, we argue that the evidence strongly points to an electronic mechanism of nematicity, placing nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity and density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for nematicity and link them to the properties of the magnetic and superconducting states, providing a unified perspective on the phase diagram of the iron pnictides.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

article,Real-space tailoring of the electron–phonon coupling in ultraclean nanotube mechanical resonators,"<p>The coupling between electrons and phonons is at the heart of many fundamental phenomena in nature. Despite tremendous advances in controlling electrons or phonons in engineered nanosystems, control over their coupling is still widely lacking. Here we demonstrate the ability to fully tailor electron&#8211;phonon interactions using a new class of suspended carbon nanotube devices, in which we can form highly tunable single and double quantum dots at arbitrary locations along a nanotube mechanical resonator. We find that electron&#8211;phonon coupling can be turned on and off by controlling the position of a quantum dot along the resonator. Using double quantum dots we structure the interactions in real space to couple specific electronic and phononic modes. This tailored coupling allows measurement of the phonons&#8217; spatial parity and imaging of their mode shapes. Finally, we demonstrate coupling between phonons and internal electrons in an isolated system, decoupled from the random environment of the electronic leads, a crucial step towards fully engineered quantum-coherent electron&#8211;phonon systems.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Room-temperature quantum microwave emitters based on spin defects in silicon carbide,"<p>Atomic-scale defects in silicon carbide are always present and usually limit the performance of this material in high-power electronics and radiofrequency communication. Here, we reveal a family of homotypic silicon vacancy defects in silicon carbide exhibiting attractive spin properties. In particular, the defect spins can be initialized and read out even at room temperature by means of optically detected magnetic resonance, suggesting appealing applications such as spin qubits and spin magnetometers. Using this technique we detect two-quantum spin resonances, providing strong evidence for the S&#8201;=&#8201;3/2 ground state of the silicon vacancy defects. The optically induced population inversion of these high-spin ground states leads to stimulated microwave emission, which we directly observed in our silicon carbide crystals. The analysis based on the experimentally obtained parameters shows that this property can be used to implement solid-state masers and extraordinarily sensitive radiofrequency amplifiers.</p>",[],False,"[""H.

article,Liposome adhesion generates traction stress,"<p>Mechanical forces generated by cells modulate global shape changes required for essential life processes, such as polarization, division and spreading. Although the contribution of the cytoskeleton to cellular force generation is widely recognized, the role of the membrane is considered to be restricted to passively transmitting forces. Therefore, the mechanisms by which the membrane can directly contribute to cell tension are overlooked and poorly understood. To address this, we directly measure the stresses generated during liposome adhesion. We find that liposome spreading generates large traction stresses on compliant substrates. These stresses can be understood as the equilibration of internal, hydrostatic pressures generated by the enhanced membrane tension built up during adhesion. These results underscore the role of membranes in the generation of mechanical stresses on cellular length scales and that the modulation of hydrostatic pressure due to membrane tension and adhesion can be channelled to perform mechanical work on the environment.</p>",[],False,"[""Michael P.
