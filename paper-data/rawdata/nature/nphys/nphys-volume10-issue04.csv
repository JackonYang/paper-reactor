progress article,Quantum causality,"<p>Traditionally, quantum theory assumes the existence of a fixed background causal structure. But if the laws of quantum mechanics are applied to the causal relations, then one could imagine situations in which the causal order of events is not always fixed, but is subject to quantum uncertainty. Such indefinite causal structures could make new quantum information processing tasks possible and provide methodological tools in quantum theories of gravity. Here, I review recent theoretical progress in this emerging area.</p>",[],True,"[""\u010caslav Brukner""]","Brukner, Č. Quantum causality.

review article,Nonlocality beyond quantum mechanics,"<p>Nonlocality is the most characteristic feature of quantum mechanics, but recent research seems to suggest the possible existence of nonlocal correlations stronger than those predicted by theory. This raises the question of whether nature is in fact more nonlocal than expected from quantum theory or, alternatively, whether there could be an as yet undiscovered principle limiting the strength of nonlocal correlations. Here, I review some of the recent directions in the intensive theoretical effort to answer this question.</p>",[],True,"[""Sandu Popescu""]","Popescu, S. Nonlocality beyond quantum mechanics.

Experiments with light at the single-photon level have historically been at the forefront of fundamental tests of quantum theory and the current developments in photonic technologies enable the exploration of new directions. Here we review recent photonic experiments to test two important themes in quantum mechanics: wave&#8211;particle duality, which is central to complementarity and delayed-choice experiments; and Bell nonlocality, where the latest theoretical and technological advances have allowed all controversial loopholes to be separately addressed in different experiments.</p>",[],True,"[""Peter Shadbolt"", ""Jonathan C.

article,Polaron spin current transport in organic semiconductors,"<p>In spintronics, pure spin currents play a key role in transmitting, processing and storing information. A pure spin current is a flow of electron spin angular momentum without a simultaneous flow of charge current. It can be carried by conduction electrons or magnons and has been studied in many inorganic metals, semiconductors and insulators, but not yet in organic semiconductors. Charge carriers in &#960;-conjugated organic materials are localized spin-1/2 polarons which move by hopping, but the mechanisms of their spin transport and relaxation are not well understood. Here we use ferromagnetic resonance spin pumping in a ferromagnet/conjugated polymer/nonmagnetic spin-sink trilayer to demonstrate the ability of polarons to carry pure spin currents over hundreds of nanometres with long spin relaxation times of up to a millisecond and to exhibit Hanle precession. By systematically comparing charge and spin transport on the same trilayer we show that spin-orbit coupling mediates spin relaxation at room temperature.</p>",[],False,"[""Shun Watanabe"", ""Kazuya Ando"", ""Keehoon Kang"", ""Sebastian Mooser"", ""Yana Vaynzof"", ""Hidekazu Kurebayashi"", ""Eiji Saitoh"", ""Henning Sirringhaus""]","Watanabe, S., Ando, K., Kang, K. et al.

article,Experimental determination of the finite-temperature phase diagram of a spin–orbit coupled Bose gas,"<p>Spin&#8211;orbit (SO) coupling leads to numerous phenomena in electron systems. Artificial SO coupling in ultracold neutral atoms provides the opportunity to study such phenomena in bosonic systems, which exhibit superfluidity and various symmetry-breaking condensate phases. In general, a richer structure of symmetry breaking results in a nontrivial finite-temperature phase diagram, but the thermodynamics of the SO-coupled Bose gas at finite temperature remains unknown both in theory and experiment. Here we experimentally determine a new finite-temperature phase transition that is consistent with the transition between the stripe ordered phase and the magnetized phase. We also observe that the magnetic phase and the Bose condensate transitions occur simultaneously as temperature decreases. We determine the entire finite-temperature phase diagram of the SO-coupled Bose gas, thus illustrating the power of quantum simulation.</p>",[],False,"[""Si-Cong Ji"", ""Jin-Yi Zhang"", ""Long Zhang"", ""Zhi-Dong Du"", ""Wei Zheng"", ""You-Jin Deng"", ""Hui Zhai"", ""Shuai Chen"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Ji, SC., Zhang, JY., Zhang, L. et al.

article,Bidirectional and efficient conversion between microwave and optical light,"<p>Converting low-frequency electrical signals into much higher-frequency optical signals has enabled modern communication networks to leverage the strengths of both microfabricated electrical circuits and optical fibre transmission, enabling information networks to grow in size and complexity. A microwave-to-optical converter in a quantum information network could provide similar gains by linking quantum processors through low-loss optical fibres and enabling a large-scale quantum network. However, no current technology can convert low-frequency microwave signals into high-frequency optical signals while preserving their fragile quantum state. Here we demonstrate a converter that provides a bidirectional, coherent and efficient link between the microwave and optical portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. We use our converter to transfer classical signals between microwave and optical light with conversion efficiencies of &#8764;10%, and achieve performance sufficient to transfer quantum states if the device were further precooled from its current 4 K operating temperature to temperatures below 40 mK.</p>",[],False,"[""R.
