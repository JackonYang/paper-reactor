review article,Spin and pseudospins in layered transition metal dichalcogenides,"<p>The recent emergence of two-dimensional layered materials &#8212; in particular the transition metal dichalcogenides &#8212; provides a new laboratory for exploring the internal quantum degrees of freedom of electrons and their potential for new electronics. These degrees of freedom are the real electron spin, the layer pseudospin, and the valley pseudospin. New methods for the quantum control of the spin and these pseudospins arise from the existence of Berry phase-related physical properties and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The former leads to the versatile control of the valley pseudospin, whereas the latter gives rise to an interplay between the spin and the pseudospins. Here, we provide a brief review of both theoretical and experimental advances in this field.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaodong Xu"", ""Wang Yao"", ""Di Xiao"", ""Tony F.

article,The dynamics of quantum criticality revealed by quantum Monte Carlo and holography,"<p>Understanding the dynamics of quantum systems without long-lived excitations (quasiparticles) constitutes an important yet challenging problem. Although numerical techniques can yield results for the dynamics in imaginary time, their reliable continuation to real time has proved difficult. We tackle this issue using the superfluid&#8211;insulator quantum critical point of bosons on a two-dimensional lattice, where quantum fluctuations destroy quasiparticles. We present quantum Monte Carlo simulations for two separate lattice realizations. Their low-frequency conductivities turn out to have the same universal dependence on imaginary frequency and temperature. Using the structure of the real-time dynamics of conformal field theories described by the holographic gauge/gravity duality, we then make progress on the problem of analytically continuing the numerical data to real time. Our method yields quantitative and experimentally testable results on the frequency-dependent conductivity near the quantum critical point. Extensions to other observables and universality classes are discussed.</p>",[],False,"[""William Witczak-Krempa"", ""Erik S.

article,Ferroelectric quantum criticality,"<p>Paramagnets on the border of ferromagnetism at low temperatures are more subtle and complex than anticipated by the conventional theory of quantum critical phenomena. Could quantum criticality theory be more relevant in the corresponding case of quantum paraelectrics on the border of ferroelectricity? To address this question we have investigated the temperature dependence of the dielectric function of the displacive quantum paraelectrics SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, oxygen-18 substituted SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and KTaO<sub>3</sub>. In all of these materials on the border of ferroelectricity we observe non-classical T<sup>2</sup> temperature dependencies of the inverse dielectric function below 50 K, followed by anomalous upturns below a few kelvin extending into the millikelvin range. This non-classical behaviour can be understood quantitatively without adjustable parameters in terms of quantum criticality theory when extended to include the effects of long-range dipolar interactions and the coupling of the electric polarization field with acoustic phonons. The quantum critical regime in displacive ferroelectrics is thus strikingly different from that in the better-known ferromagnetic counterparts and offers unexpected prospects in the field of quantum phase transitions.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

article,Quantum and classical criticality in a dimerized quantum antiferromagnet,"<p>A quantum critical point (QCP) is a singularity in the phase diagram arising because of quantum mechanical fluctuations. The exotic properties of some of the most enigmatic physical systems, including unconventional metals and superconductors, quantum magnets and ultracold atomic condensates, have been related to the importance of critical quantum and thermal fluctuations near such a point. However, direct and continuous control of these fluctuations has been difficult to realize, and complete thermodynamic and spectroscopic information is required to disentangle the effects of quantum and classical physics around a QCP. Here we achieve this control in a high-pressure, high-resolution neutron scattering experiment on the quantum dimer material TlCuCl<sub>3</sub>. By measuring the magnetic excitation spectrum across the entire quantum critical phase diagram, we illustrate the similarities between quantum and thermal melting of magnetic order. We prove the critical nature of the unconventional longitudinal (Higgs) mode of the ordered phase by damping it thermally. We demonstrate the development of two types of criticality, quantum and classical, and use their static and dynamic scaling properties to conclude that quantum and thermal fluctuations can behave largely independently near a QCP.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

article,Collapse of superconductivity in a hybrid tin–graphene Josephson junction array,"<p>For a Josephson junction array with hybrid superconductor/metal/superconductor junctions, a quantum phase transition from a superconducting to a two-dimensional (2D) metallic ground state is predicted to occur on increasing the junction normal state resistance. Owing to its surface-exposed 2D electron gas and its gate-tunable charge carrier density, graphene coupled to superconductors is the ideal platform to study such phase transitions between ground states. Here, we show that decorating graphene with a sparse and regular array of superconducting discs enables the continuous gate-tuning of the quantum superconductor-to-metal transition of the Josephson junction array into a zero-temperature metallic state. The suppression of proximity-induced superconductivity is a direct consequence of the emergence of quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase of the discs. Under perpendicular magnetic fields, the competition between quantum fluctuations and disorder is responsible for the resilience of superconductivity at the lowest temperatures, supporting a glassy state that persists above the upper critical field. We provide the entire phase diagram of the disorder and magnetic-field-tuned transition to reveal the role of quantum phase fluctuations in 2D superconducting systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Zheng Han"", ""Adrien Allain"", ""Hadi Arjmandi-Tash"", ""Konstantin Tikhonov"", ""Mikhail Feigel\u2019man"", ""Benjamin Sac\u00e9p\u00e9"", ""Vincent Bouchiat""]","Han, Z., Allain, A., Arjmandi-Tash, H. et al.

article,Hidden spin polarization in inversion-symmetric bulk crystals,"<p>Spin&#8211;orbit coupling can induce spin polarization in nonmagnetic 3D crystals when the inversion symmetry is broken, as manifested by the bulk Rashba and Dresselhaus effects. We establish that these spin-polarization effects originate fundamentally from specific atomic site asymmetries, rather than, as generally accepted, from the asymmetry of the crystal space group. This understanding leads to the recognition that a previously overlooked hidden form of spin polarization should exist in centrosymmetric crystals. Although all energy bands must be doubly degenerate in centrosymmetric materials, we find that the two components of such doubly degenerate bands could have opposite polarizations, each spatially localized on one of the two separate sectors forming the inversion partners. We demonstrate such hidden spin polarizations in particular centrosymmetric crystals by first-principles calculations. This new understanding could considerably broaden the range of currently useful spintronic materials and enable the control of spin polarization by means of operations on the atomic scale.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiuwen Zhang"", ""Qihang Liu"", ""Jun-Wei Luo"", ""Arthur J.

article,Parity–time-symmetric whispering-gallery microcavities,"<p>Optical systems combining balanced loss and gain provide a unique platform to implement classical analogues of quantum systems described by non-Hermitian parity&#8211;time (PT)-symmetric Hamiltonians. Such systems can be used to create synthetic materials with properties that cannot be attained in materials having only loss or only gain. Here we report PT-symmetry breaking in coupled optical resonators. We observed non-reciprocity in the PT-symmetry-breaking phase due to strong field localization, which significantly enhances nonlinearity. In the linear regime, light transmission is reciprocal regardless of whether the symmetry is broken or unbroken. We show that in one direction there is a complete absence of resonance peaks whereas in the other direction the transmission is resonantly enhanced, a feature directly associated with the use of resonant structures.
