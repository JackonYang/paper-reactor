article,Two-stage magnetic-field-tuned superconductor–insulator transition in underdoped La2−xSrxCuO4,"<p>In the underdoped pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors, the normal state is commonly probed by applying a magnetic field (H). However, the nature of the H-induced resistive state has been the subject of a long-term debate, and clear evidence for a zero-temperature H-tuned superconductor&#8211;insulator transition has proved elusive. Here we report magnetoresistance measurements on underdoped La<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, providing striking evidence for quantum-critical behaviour of the resistivity&#8212;the signature of a H-driven superconductor&#8211;insulator transition. The transition is not direct, being accompanied by the emergence of an intermediate state, which is a superconductor only at temperature T&#160;=&#160;0. Our finding of a two-stage H-driven superconductor&#8211;insulator transition goes beyond the conventional scenario in which a single quantum critical point separates the superconductor and the insulator in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. Similar two-stage H-driven superconductor&#8211;insulator transitions, in which both disorder and quantum phase fluctuations play an important role, may also be expected in other copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaoyan Shi"", ""Ping V.

article,Remarkable effects of disorder on superconductivity of single atomic layers of lead on silicon,"<p>In bulk materials, superconductivity is remarkably robust with respect to non-magnetic disorder. In the two-dimensional limit, however, disorder and electron correlations both tend to destroy the quantum condensate. Here we study, both experimentally and theoretically, the effect of structural disorder on the local spectral response of crystalline superconducting monolayers of lead on silicon. In a direct scanning tunnelling microscopy measurement, we reveal how the local superconducting spectra lose their conventional character and show variations at scales significantly shorter than the coherence length. We demonstrate that the precise atomic organization determines the robustness of the superconducting order with respect to structural defects, such as single atomic steps, which may disrupt superconductivity and act as native Josephson barriers. We expect that our results will improve the understanding of microscopic processes in surface and interface superconductivity, and will open a new way of engineering atomic-scale superconducting quantum devices.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

article,Commensurate–incommensurate transition in graphene on hexagonal boron nitride,"<p>When a crystal is subjected to a periodic potential, under certain circumstances it can adjust itself to follow the periodicity of the potential, resulting in a commensurate state. Of particular interest are topological defects between the two commensurate phases, such as solitons and domain walls. Here we report a commensurate&#8211;incommensurate transition for graphene on top of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Depending on the rotation angle between the lattices of the two crystals, graphene can either stretch to adapt to a slightly different hBN periodicity (for small angles, resulting in a commensurate state) or exhibit little adjustment (the incommensurate state). In the commensurate state, areas with matching lattice constants are separated by domain walls that accumulate the generated strain. Such soliton-like objects are not only of significant fundamental interest, but their presence could also explain recent experiments where electronic and optical properties of graphene-hBN heterostructures were observed to be considerably altered.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

article,Universal features in the energetics of symmetry breaking,"<p>A breaking of symmetry involves an abrupt change in the set of microstates a system can explore. This change has unavoidable thermodynamic implications: a shrinkage of the microstate set results in an entropy decrease, which eventually needs to be compensated by heat dissipation and hence requires work. On the other hand, in a spontaneous symmetry breaking, the available phase-space volume changes without the need for work, yielding an apparent entropy decrease. Here we show that this entropy decrease is a key ingredient of a Szilard engine and Landauer&#8217;s principle, and perform a direct measurement of the entropy change along symmetry-breaking transitions for a Brownian particle subject to a bistable potential realized through two optical traps. The experiment confirms theoretical results based on fluctuation theorems, enables the construction of a Szilard engine extracting energy from a single thermal bath, and shows that a signature of a symmetry breaking in a system&#8217;s energetics is observable.</p>",[],False,"[""\u00c9.
