review article,Energy gaps in high-transition-temperature cuprate superconductors,"<p>The spectral energy gap is an important signature that defines states of quantum matter: insulators, density waves and superconductors have very different gap structures. The momentum-resolved nature of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) makes it a powerful tool to characterize spectral gaps. ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic d-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transition-temperature (T<sub>c</sub>) cuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous gap above T<sub>c</sub>, often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy. The nature of this poorly understood pseudogap and its relationship with superconductivity has since become the focal point of research in the field. To address this issue, the momentum, temperature, doping and materials dependence of spectral gaps have been extensively examined with significantly improved instrumentation and carefully matched experiments in recent years. This article overviews the current understanding and unresolved issues of the basic phenomenology of gap hierarchy. We show how ARPES has been sensitive to phase transitions, has distinguished between orders having distinct broken electronic symmetries, and has uncovered rich momentum- and temperature-dependent fingerprints reflecting an intertwined and competing relationship between the ordered states and superconductivity that results in multiple phenomenologically distinct ground states inside the superconducting dome. These results provide us with microscopic insights into the cuprate phase diagram.</p>",[],False,"[""Makoto Hashimoto"", ""Inna M. Vishik"", ""Rui-Hua He"", ""Thomas P.

article,Hierarchy of Hofstadter states and replica quantum Hall ferromagnetism in graphene superlattices,"<p>Self-similarity and fractals have fascinated researchers across various disciplines. In graphene placed on boron nitride and subjected to a magnetic field, self-similarity appears in the form of numerous replicas of the original Dirac spectrum, and their quantization gives rise to a fractal pattern of Landau levels, referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. Here we employ capacitance spectroscopy to probe directly the density of states (DoS) and energy gaps in this spectrum. Without a magnetic field, replica spectra are seen as pronounced DoS minima surrounded by van Hove singularities. The Hofstadter butterfly shows up as recurring Landau fan diagrams in high fields. Electron&#8211;electron interactions add another twist to the self-similar behaviour. We observe suppression of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, a reverse Stoner transition at commensurable fluxes and additional ferromagnetism within replica spectra. The strength and variety of the interaction effects indicate a large playground to study many-body physics in fractal Dirac systems.</p>",[],False,"[""G. L. Yu"", ""R. V. Gorbachev"", ""J. S.

article,Mammalian pitch sensation shaped by the cochlear fluid,"<p>The perceived pitch of a complex harmonic sound changes if the partial tones of the sound are frequency shifted by a fixed amount. Simple mathematical rules are expected to govern perceived pitch, but these rules are violated in psychoacoustic experiments. Cognitive cortical processes are commonly held responsible for this discrepancy. Here, we demonstrate that this need not be the case. We show that human pitch perception can be reproduced with a biophysically motivated mesoscopic model of the cochlea, by fully recovering published psychoacoustical pitch-shift data and related physiological measurements from the cat cochlear nucleus. Our study suggests that perceived pitch can be attributed to combination tones in the presence of a cochlear fluid.</p>",[],False,"[""Florian Gomez"", ""Ruedi Stoop""]","Gomez, F., Stoop, R.
