article,One-dimensional topological edge states of bismuth bilayers,"<p>The hallmark of a topologically insulating state of matter in two dimensions protected by time-reversal symmetry is the existence of chiral edge modes propagating along the perimeter of the sample. Among the first systems predicted to be a two-dimensional topological insulator are bilayers of bismuth. Here we report scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments on bulk Bi crystals that show that a subset of the predicted Bi-bilayers&#8217; edge states are decoupled from the states of the substrate and provide direct spectroscopic evidence of their one-dimensional nature. Moreover, by visualizing the quantum interference of edge-mode quasi-particles in confined geometries, we demonstrate their remarkable coherent propagation along the edge with scattering properties consistent with strong suppression of backscattering as predicted for the propagating topological edge states.</p>",[],False,"[""Ilya K.

article,Emergent ice rule and magnetic charge screening from vertex frustration in artificial spin ice,"<p>Artificial spin ice comprises a class of frustrated arrays of interacting single-domain ferromagnetic nanostructures. Previous studies of artificial spin ice have focused on simple lattices based on natural frustrated materials. Here we experimentally examine artificial spin ice created on the shakti lattice, a structure that does not directly correspond to any known natural magnetic material. On the shakti lattice, none of the near-neighbour interactions is locally frustrated, but instead the lattice topology frustrates the interactions leading to a high degree of degeneracy. We demonstrate that the shakti system achieves a physical realization of the classic six-vertex model ground state. Furthermore, we observe that the mixed coordination of the shakti lattice leads to crystallization of effective magnetic charges and the screening of magnetic excitations, underscoring the importance of magnetic charge as the relevant degree of freedom in artificial spin ice and opening new possibilities for studies of its dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""Ian Gilbert"", ""Gia-Wei Chern"", ""Sheng Zhang"", ""Liam O\u2019Brien"", ""Bryce Fore"", ""Cristiano Nisoli"", ""Peter Schiffer""]","Gilbert, I., Chern, GW., Zhang, S. et al.

article,Quantum coherence in photosynthesis for efficient solar-energy conversion,"<p>The crucial step in the conversion of solar to chemical energy in photosynthesis takes place in the reaction centre, where the absorbed excitation energy is converted into a stable charge-separated state by ultrafast electron transfer events. However, the fundamental mechanism responsible for the near-unity quantum efficiency of this process is unknown. Here we elucidate the role of coherence in determining the efficiency of charge separation in the plant photosystem II reaction centre by comprehensively combining experiment (two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy) and theory (Redfield theory). We reveal the presence of electronic coherence between excitons as well as between exciton and charge-transfer states that we argue to be maintained by vibrational modes. Furthermore, we present evidence for the strong correlation between the degree of electronic coherence and efficient and ultrafast charge separation. We propose that this coherent mechanism will inspire the development of new energy technologies.</p>",[],False,"[""Elisabet Romero"", ""Ramunas Augulis"", ""Vladimir I.

article,Forces driving epithelial wound healing,"<p>A fundamental feature of multicellular organisms is their ability to self-repair wounds through the movement of epithelial cells into the damaged area. This collective cellular movement is commonly attributed to a combination of cell crawling and &#8216;purse-string&#8217; contraction of a supracellular actomyosin ring. Here we show by direct experimental measurement that these two mechanisms are insufficient to explain force patterns observed during wound closure. At early stages of the process, leading actin protrusions generate traction forces that point away from the wound, showing that wound closure is initially driven by cell crawling. At later stages, we observed unanticipated patterns of traction forces pointing towards the wound. Such patterns have strong force components that are both radial and tangential to the wound. We show that these force components arise from tensions transmitted by a heterogeneous actomyosin ring to the underlying substrate through focal adhesions. The structural and mechanical organization reported here provides cells with a mechanism to close the wound by cooperatively compressing the underlying substrate.</p>",[],False,"[""Agust\u00ed Brugu\u00e9s"", ""Ester Anon"", ""Vito Conte"", ""Jim H.

article,Information transfer and behavioural inertia in starling flocks,"<p>Collective decision-making in biological systems requires all individuals in the group to go through a behavioural change of state. During this transition fast and robust transfer of information is essential to prevent cohesion loss. The mechanism by which natural groups achieve such robustness, however, is not clear. Here we present an experimental study of starling flocks performing collective turns. We find that information about direction changes propagates across the flock with a linear dispersion law and negligible attenuation, hence minimizing group decoherence. These results contrast starkly with present models of collective motion, which predict diffusive transport of information. Building on spontaneous symmetry breaking and conservation-law arguments, we formulate a theory that correctly reproduces linear and undamped propagation. Essential to this framework is the inclusion of the birds&#8217; behavioural inertia. The theory not only explains the data, but also predicts that information transfer must be faster the stronger the group&#8217;s orientational order, a prediction accurately verified by the data. Our results suggest that swift decision-making may be the adaptive drive for the strong behavioural polarization observed in many living groups.</p>",[],False,"[""Alessandro Attanasi"", ""Andrea Cavagna"", ""Lorenzo Del Castello"", ""Irene Giardina"", ""Tomas S.
