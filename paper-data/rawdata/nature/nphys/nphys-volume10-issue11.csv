review article,Exciton–polariton condensates,"<p>Recently a new type of system exhibiting spontaneous coherence has emerged&#8212;the exciton&#8211;polariton condensate. Exciton&#8211;polaritons (or polaritons for short) are bosonic quasiparticles that exist inside semiconductor microcavities, consisting of a superposition of an exciton and a cavity photon. Above a threshold density the polaritons macroscopically occupy the same quantum state, forming a condensate. The polaritons have a lifetime that is typically comparable to or shorter than thermalization times, giving them an inherently non-equilibrium nature. Nevertheless, they exhibit many of the features that would be expected of equilibrium Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates (BECs). The non-equilibrium nature of the system raises fundamental questions as to what it means for a system to be a BEC, and introduces new physics beyond that seen in other macroscopically coherent systems. In this review we focus on several physical phenomena exhibited by exciton&#8211;polariton condensates. In particular, we examine topics such as the difference between a polariton BEC, a polariton laser and a photon laser, as well as physical phenomena such as superfluidity, vortex formation, and Berezinskii&#8211;Kosterlitz&#8211;Thouless and Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer physics. We also discuss the physics and applications of engineered polariton structures.</p>",[],False,"[""Tim Byrnes"", ""Na Young Kim"", ""Yoshihisa Yamamoto""]","Byrnes, T., Kim, N. & Yamamoto, Y.

article,Pseudospin-driven spin relaxation mechanism in graphene,"<p>The prospect of transporting spin information over long distances in graphene, possible because of its small intrinsic spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) and vanishing hyperfine interaction, has stimulated intense research exploring spintronics applications. However, measured spin relaxation times are orders of magnitude smaller than initially predicted, while the main physical process for spin dephasing and its charge-density and disorder dependences remain unconvincingly described by conventional mechanisms. Here, we unravel a spin relaxation mechanism for non-magnetic samples that follows from an entanglement between spin and pseudospin driven by random SOC, unique to graphene. The mixing between spin and pseudospin-related Berry&#8217;s phases results in fast spin dephasing even when approaching the ballistic limit, with increasing relaxation times away from the Dirac point, as observed experimentally. The SOC can be caused by adatoms, ripples or even the substrate, suggesting novel spin manipulation strategies based on the pseudospin degree of freedom.</p>",[],False,"[""Dinh Van Tuan"", ""Frank Ortmann"", ""David Soriano"", ""Sergio O.

article,Observation of self-amplifying Hawking radiation in an analogue black-hole laser,"<p>By a combination of quantum field theory and general relativity, black holes have been predicted to emit Hawking radiation. Observation from an actual black hole is, however, probably extremely difficult, so attention has turned to analogue systems in the search for such radiation. Here, we create a narrow, low density, very low temperature atomic Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate, containing an analogue black-hole horizon and an inner horizon, as in a charged black hole. We report the observation of Hawking radiation emitted by this black-hole analogue, which is the output of the black-hole laser formed between the horizons. We also observe the exponential growth of a standing wave between the horizons, which results from interference between the negative-energy partners of the Hawking radiation and the negative-energy particles reflected from the inner horizon. We thus observe self-amplifying Hawking radiation.</p>",[],False,"[""Jeff Steinhauer""]","Steinhauer, J. Observation of self-amplifying Hawking radiation in an analogue black-hole laser.

article,Ultrafast plasmonic nanowire lasers near the surface plasmon frequency,"<p>Light&#8211;matter interactions are inherently slow as the wavelengths of optical and electronic states differ greatly. Surface plasmon polaritons &#8212; electromagnetic excitations at metal&#8211;dielectric interfaces &#8212; have generated significant interest because their spatial scale is decoupled from the vacuum wavelength, promising accelerated light&#8211;matter interactions. Although recent reports suggest the possibility of accelerated dynamics in surface plasmon lasers, this remains to be verified. Here, we report the observation of pulses shorter than 800 fs from hybrid plasmonic zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire lasers. Operating at room temperature, ZnO excitons lie near the surface plasmon frequency in such silver-based plasmonic lasers, leading to accelerated spontaneous recombination, gain switching and gain recovery compared with conventional ZnO nanowire lasers. Surprisingly, the laser dynamics can be as fast as gain thermalization in ZnO, which precludes lasing in the thinnest nanowires (diameter less than 120 nm). The capability to combine surface plasmon localization with ultrafast amplification provides the means for generating extremely intense optical fields, with applications in sensing, nonlinear optical switching, as well as in the physics of strong-field phenomena.</p>",[],False,"[""Themistoklis P.

article,Exotic circuit elements from zero-modes in hybrid superconductor–quantum-Hall systems,"<p>The fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity, remarkable phenomena in their own right, can harbour even more exotic physics at their interface. In particular, coupling quantum Hall edges&#160;with a superconductor can create emergent excitations known as non-Abelian anyons that trap widely coveted Majorana fermion zero-modes and generalizations thereof. We uncover non-local transport signatures of these zero-modes that not only provide striking experimental signatures of the anyons, but moreover allow one to construct novel circuit&#160;elements, including superconducting current and voltage mirrors, fractional charge transistors and flux-based capacitors. Underlying this unusual transport is a phenomenon that we term &#8216;perfect Andreev conversion&#8217;&#8212;whereby quasiparticles propagating chirally at the edge reverse their electric charge as a result of hybridization with the zero-modes.

article,Asymmetry of collective excitations in electron- and hole-doped cuprate superconductors,"<p>High-temperature superconductivity emerges on doping holes or electrons into antiferromagnetic copper oxides. The large energy scale of magnetic excitations, for example, compared with phonon energies, is thought to drive superconductivity with high transition temperatures (T<sub>c</sub>). Comparing high-energy magnetic excitations of hole-&#160;and electron-doped superconductors provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering at the Cu L<sub>3</sub>-edge to reveal collective excitations in the electron-doped cuprate Nd<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Ce<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. Surprisingly, magnetic excitations harden significantly across the antiferromagnetic high-temperature superconductivity phase boundary despite short-ranged antiferromagnetic correlations, in contrast to the hole-doped cuprates. Furthermore, we find an unexpected branch of collective modes in superconducting compounds, absent in hole-doped cuprates. These modes emanate from the zone centre and possess a higher temperature scale than T<sub>c</sub>, signalling a distinct quantum phase. Despite their differences, the persistence of magnetic excitations and the existence of a distinct quantum phase are apparently universal in both hole-&#160;and electron-doped cuprates.</p>",[],False,"[""W.
