article,Cooperative coupling of ultracold atoms and surface plasmons,"<p>Cooperative coupling between optical emitters and light fields is one of the outstanding goals in quantum technology. It is both fundamentally interesting for the extraordinary radiation properties of the participating emitters and has many potential applications in photonics. Although this goal has been achieved using high-finesse optical cavities, attention has turned to broadband, easy to build cavity-free approaches. Here we demonstrate cooperative coupling of ultracold atoms with surface plasmons propagating on a plane gold surface. While the atoms are moving towards the surface they are excited by an external laser pulse. The interaction between the excited atom fluorescence and surface plasmons is probed by detecting the photons emitted into the substrate when the plasmon excitations decay. A maximum Purcell factor of &#951;<sub>P</sub> = 4.9 is reached at an optimum distance of z = 250 nm from the surface.

article,Momentum-space imaging of Cooper pairing in a half-Dirac-gas topological superconductor,"<p>Superconductivity involving topological Dirac electrons has recently been proposed as a platform between concepts in high-energy and condensed-matter physics. It has been predicted that supersymmetry and Majorana fermions, both of which remain elusive in particle physics, may be realized through emergent particles in these particular superconducting systems. Using artificially fabricated topological-insulator&#8211;superconductor heterostructures, we present direct spectroscopic evidence for the existence of Cooper pairing in a weakly interacting half Dirac gas. Our studies reveal that two dimensional topological superconductivity in a helical Dirac gas is distinctly different from that in an ordinary two-dimensional superconductor in terms of the spin degrees of freedom of electrons. We further show that the pairing of Dirac electrons can be suppressed by time-reversal symmetry-breaking impurities, thereby removing the distinction. Our demonstration and momentum-space imaging of Cooper pairing in a half-Dirac-gas two-dimensional topological superconductor serve as a critically important platform for future testing of fundamental physics predictions such as emergent supersymmetry and topological quantum criticality.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Joseph Henry Laboratory, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA', 'authors': ['Su-Yang Xu', ',\xa0Nasser Alidoust', ',\xa0Ilya Belopolski', ',\xa0Chang Liu', ',\xa0Madhab Neupane', ',\xa0Guang Bian', ',\xa0Chen Fang', '\xa0&\xa0M.

article,The dynamics of a doped hole in a cuprate is not controlled by spin fluctuations,"<p>Understanding what controls the dynamics of the quasiparticle that results when a hole is doped into an antiferromagnetically ordered CuO<sub>2</sub> layer is the first necessary step in the quest for a theory of the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here we show that the long-held belief that the quantum spin fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic background play a key role in determining this dynamics is wrong. Indeed, we demonstrate that the correct, experimentally observed quasiparticle dispersion is generically obtained for a three-band model describing the hole moving on the oxygen sublattice and coupled to a N&#233;el lattice of spins without spin fluctuations. We argue that results from one-band model studies actually support this conclusion, and that this significant conceptual change in our understanding of this phenomenology opens the way to studying few-hole dynamics, to accurately gauge the strength of the &#8216;magnetic glue&#8217; and its contribution to superconductivity.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z1, Canada', 'authors': ['Hadi Ebrahimnejad', ',\xa0George A.

article,Observation of topological surface state quantum Hall effect in an intrinsic three-dimensional topological insulator,"<p>A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI) is a quantum state of matter with a gapped insulating bulk yet a conducting surface hosting topologically protected gapless surface states. One of the most distinct electronic transport signatures predicted for such topological surface states (TSS) is a well-defined half-integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) in a magnetic field, where the surface Hall conductivities become quantized in units of (1/2)e<sup>2</sup>/h (e being the electron charge, h the Planck constant) concomitant with vanishing resistance. Here, we observe a well-developed QHE arising from TSS in an intrinsic TI of BiSbTeSe<sub>2</sub>. Our samples exhibit surface-dominated conduction even close to room temperature, whereas the bulk conduction is negligible. At low temperatures and high magnetic fields perpendicular to the top and bottom surfaces, we observe well-developed integer quantized Hall plateaux, where the two parallel surfaces each contribute a half-integer e<sup>2</sup>/h quantized Hall conductance, accompanied by vanishing longitudinal resistance. When the bottom surface is gated to match the top surface in carrier density, only odd integer QH plateaux are observed, representing a half-integer QHE of two degenerate Dirac gases. This system provides an excellent platform to pursue a plethora of exotic physics and novel device applications predicted for TIs, ranging from magnetic monopoles and Majorana particles to dissipationless electronics and fault-tolerant quantum&#160;computers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA', 'authors': ['Yang Xu', ',\xa0Ireneusz Miotkowski', ',\xa0Jifa Tian', '\xa0&\xa0Yong P.

article,"Strain-induced partially flat band, helical snake states and interface superconductivity in topological crystalline insulators","<p>Topological crystalline insulators in IV&#8211;VI compounds host novel topological surface states consisting of multi-valley massless Dirac fermions at low energy. Here we show that strain generically acts as an effective gauge field on these Dirac fermions and creates pseudo-Landau orbitals without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We predict the realization of this phenomenon in IV&#8211;VI semiconductor heterostructures, due to a naturally occurring misfit dislocation array at the interface that produces a periodically varying strain field. Remarkably, the zero-energy Landau orbitals form a flat band in the vicinity of the Dirac point, and coexist with a network of snake states at higher energy. We propose that the high density of states of this flat band gives rise to interface superconductivity observed in IV&#8211;VI semiconductor multilayers at unusually high temperatures, with non-Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer behaviour. Our work demonstrates a new route to altering macroscopic electronic properties to achieve a partially flat band, and provides a starting point for realizing novel correlated states of matter.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA', 'authors': ['Evelyn Tang', '\xa0&\xa0Liang Fu']}]",False,"['Evelyn Tang', 'Liang Fu']","Tang, E., Fu, L.

article,Topological defects as relics of emergent continuous symmetry and Higgs condensation of disorder in ferroelectrics,"<p>Lars Onsager and Richard Feynman envisaged that the three-dimensional (3D) superfluid-to-normal &#955; transition in <sup>4</sup>He occurs through the proliferation of vortices. This process should hold for every phase transition in the same universality class. The role of topological defects in symmetry-breaking phase transitions has become a prime topic in cosmology and high-temperature superconductivity, even though direct imaging of these defects is challenging. Here we show that the U(1) continuous symmetry that emerges at the ferroelectric critical point of multiferroic hexagonal manganites leads to a similar proliferation of vortices. Moreover, the disorder field (vortices) is coupled to an emergent U(1) gauge field, which becomes massive by means of the Higgs mechanism when vortices condense (span the whole system) on heating above the ferroelectric transition temperature. Direct imaging of the vortex network in hexagonal manganites offers unique experimental access to this dual description of the ferroelectric transition, while enabling tests of the Kibble&#8211;Zurek mechanism.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Theoretical Division, T-4 and CNLS, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA', 'authors': ['Shi-Zeng Lin', ',\xa0Yoshitomo Kamiya', ',\xa0Gia-Wei Chern', ',\xa0Wojciech H.
