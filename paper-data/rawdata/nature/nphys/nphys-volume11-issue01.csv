article,Theory of universal incoherent metallic transport,"<p>The anomalous transport of important materials such as high-temperature superconductors and other &#8216;bad metals&#8217; is not well understood theoretically. In an incoherent metal, transport is controlled by the collective diffusion of energy and charge rather than by quasiparticle or momentum relaxation. Here, we explore the possibility of a universal bound D &#8819; &#8463;&#957;<sub>F</sub><sup>2</sup>/(k<sub>B</sub>T) on the underlying diffusion constants in an incoherent metal. Such a bound is loosely motivated by results from holographic duality, the uncertainty principle and measurements of diffusion in strongly interacting non-metallic systems. Metals close to saturating this bound are shown to have a linear-in-temperature resistivity with an underlying dissipative timescale matching that recently deduced from experimental data on a wide range of metals. This bound may therefore be responsible for the ubiquitous appearance of high-temperature regimes in metals with T-linear resistivity. To establish this calls for direct measurements of diffusive processes and of charge susceptibilities in incoherent metals.</p>",[],False,"[""Sean A. Hartnoll""]","Hartnoll, S.

article,Fractional excitations in the square-lattice quantum antiferromagnet,"<p>Quantum magnets have occupied the fertile ground between many-body theory and low-temperature experiments on real materials since the early days of quantum mechanics. However, our understanding of even deceptively simple systems of interacting spin-1/2 particles is far from complete. The quantum square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, for example, exhibits a striking anomaly of hitherto unknown origin in its magnetic excitation spectrum. This quantum effect manifests itself for excitations propagating with the specific wavevector (&#960;, 0). We use polarized neutron spectroscopy to fully characterize the magnetic fluctuations in the metal-organic compound Cu(DCOO)<sub>2</sub>&#8901;4D<sub>2</sub>O, a known realization of the quantum square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet model. Our experiments reveal an isotropic excitation continuum at the anomaly, which we analyse theoretically using Gutzwiller-projected trial wavefunctions. The excitation continuum is accounted for by the existence of spatially extended pairs of fractional S = 1/2 quasiparticles, 2D analogues of 1D spinons. Away from the anomalous wavevector, these fractional excitations are bound and form conventional magnons. Our results establish the existence of fractional quasiparticles in the high-energy spectrum of a quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet, even in the absence of&#160;frustration.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

article,Strong magneto-chiral dichroism in a paramagnetic molecular helix observed by hard X-rays,"<p>Magneto-chiral dichroism is a non-reciprocal&#8212;that is, directional&#8212;effect observed in magnetized chiral systems, featuring an unbalanced absorption of unpolarized light depending on the direction of the magnetization. Despite the fundamental interest in a phenomenon breaking both parity and time-reversal symmetries, magneto-chiral dichroism is one of the least investigated aspects of light&#8211;matter interaction most likely because of the weakness of the effect in most reported experiments. Here we have exploited the element selectivity of hard X-ray radiation to investigate the magneto-chiral properties of enantiopure crystals of two isostructural molecular helicoidal chains comprising either cobalt(II) or manganese(II) ions. A strong magneto-chiral dichroism, with Kuhn asymmetry of the order of a few per cent, has been observed in the cobalt chains system, whereas it is practically absent for the manganese derivative. The spectral features of the X-ray magneto-chiral dichroism signal differ significantly from the natural and magnetic dichroic contributions and have been rationalized here using the multipolar expansion of matter&#8211;radiation&#160;interaction.</p>",[],False,"[""Roberta Sessoli"", ""Marie-Emmanuelle Boulon"", ""Andrea Caneschi"", ""Matteo Mannini"", ""Lorenzo Poggini"", ""Fabrice Wilhelm"", ""Andrei Rogalev""]","Sessoli, R., Boulon, ME., Caneschi, A. et al.

article,Carrier dynamics in Landau-quantized graphene featuring strong Auger scattering,"<p> The energy spectrum of common two-dimensional electron gases consists of a harmonic (that is, equidistant) ladder of Landau levels, thus preventing the possibility of optically addressing individual transitions. In graphene, however, owing to its non-harmonic spectrum, individual levels can be addressed selectively. Here, we report a time-resolved experiment directly pumping discrete Landau levels in graphene. Energetically degenerate Landau-level transitions from n = &#8722;1 to n = 0 and from n = 0 to n = 1 are distinguished by applying circularly polarized THz light. An analysis based on a microscopic theory shows that the zeroth Landau level is actually depleted by strong Auger scattering, even though it is optically pumped at the same time. The surprisingly strong electron&#8211;electron interaction responsible for this effect is directly evidenced through a sign reversal of the pump&#8211;probe&#160;signal.</p>",[],False,"[""Martin Mittendorff"", ""Florian Wendler"", ""Ermin Malic"", ""Andreas Knorr"", ""Milan Orlita"", ""Marek Potemski"", ""Claire Berger"", ""Walter A. de Heer"", ""Harald Schneider"", ""Manfred Helm"", ""Stephan Winnerl""]","Mittendorff, M., Wendler, F., Malic, E. et al.

article,Stiffening solids with liquid inclusions,"<p>From bone and wood to concrete and carbon fibre, composites are ubiquitous natural and synthetic materials. Eshelby&#8217;s inclusion theory describes how macroscopic stress fields couple to isolated microscopic inclusions, allowing prediction of a composite&#8217;s bulk mechanical properties from a knowledge of its microstructure. It has been extended to describe a wide variety of phenomena from solid fracture to cell adhesion. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that Eshelby&#8217;s theory breaks down for small liquid inclusions in a soft solid. In this limit, an isolated droplet&#8217;s deformation is strongly size-dependent, with the smallest droplets mimicking the behaviour of solid inclusions. Furthermore, in opposition to the predictions of conventional composite theory, we find that finite concentrations of small liquid inclusions enhance the stiffness of soft solids. A straightforward extension of Eshelby&#8217;s theory, accounting for the surface tension of the solid&#8211;liquid interface, explains our experimental observations. The counterintuitive stiffening of solids by fluid inclusions is expected whenever inclusion radii are smaller than an elastocapillary length, given by the ratio of the surface tension to Young&#8217;s modulus of the solid matrix. These results suggest that surface tension can be a simple and effective mechanism to cloak the far-field elastic signature of&#160;inclusions.</p>",[],False,"[""Robert W.
