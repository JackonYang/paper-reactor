progress article,Active gel physics,"<p>The mechanical behaviour of cells is largely controlled by a structure that is fundamentally out of thermodynamic equilibrium: a network of crosslinked filaments subjected to the action of energy-transducing molecular motors. The study of this kind of active system was absent from conventional physics and there was a need for both new theories and new experiments. The field that has emerged in recent years to fill this gap is underpinned by a theory that takes into account the transduction of chemical energy on the molecular scale. This formalism has advanced our understanding of living systems, but it has also had an impact on research in physics per&#160;se. Here, we describe this developing field, its relevance to biology, the novelty it conveys to other areas of physics and some of the challenges in store for the future of active gel physics.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

progress article,Towards quantum thermodynamics in electronic circuits,"<p>Electronic circuits operating at sub-kelvin temperatures are attractive candidates for studying classical and quantum thermodynamics: their temperature can be controlled and measured locally with exquisite precision, and they allow experiments with large statistical samples. The availability and rapid development of devices such as quantum dots, single-electron boxes and superconducting qubits only enhance their appeal. But although these systems provide fertile ground for studying heat transport, entropy production and work in the context of quantum mechanics, the field remains in its infancy experimentally. Here, we review some recent experiments on quantum heat transport, fluctuation relations and implementations of Maxwell&#8217;s demon, revealing the rich physics yet to be fully probed in these systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Jukka P.

review article,Quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium,"<p>How do closed quantum many-body systems driven out of equilibrium eventually achieve equilibration? And how do these systems thermalize, given that they comprise so many degrees of freedom? Progress in answering these&#8212;and related&#8212;questions has accelerated in recent years&#8212;a trend that can be partially attributed to success with experiments performing quantum simulations using ultracold atoms and trapped ions. Here we provide an overview of this progress, specifically in studies probing dynamical equilibration and thermalization of systems driven out of equilibrium by quenches, ramps and periodic driving. In doing so, we also address topics such as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localization and universality near phase transitions, as well as future prospects for quantum simulation.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

review article,Thermodynamics of information,"<p>By its very nature, the second law of thermodynamics is probabilistic, in that its formulation requires a probabilistic description of the state of a system. This raises questions about the objectivity of the second law: does it depend, for example, on what we know about the system? For over a century, much effort has been devoted to incorporating information into thermodynamics and assessing the entropic and energetic costs of manipulating information. More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation. Here we give an introduction to a novel theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of information based on stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems, review some recent experimental results, and present an overview of the state of the art in the field.</p>",[],False,"[""Juan M.

article,The Higgs mode in disordered superconductors close to a quantum phase transition,"<p>The concept of mass generation by means of the Higgs mechanism was strongly inspired by earlier works on the Meissner&#8211;Ochsenfeld effect in superconductors. In quantum field theory, the excitations of longitudinal components of the Higgs field manifest as massive Higgs bosons. The analogous Higgs mode in superconductors has not yet been observed owing to its rapid decay into particle&#8211;hole pairs. According to recent theories, however, the Higgs mode should decrease below the superconducting pairing gap 2&#916; and become visible in two-dimensional systems close to the superconductor&#8211;insulator transition. For experimental verification, we measured the complex terahertz transmission and tunnelling density of states of various thin films of superconducting NbN and InO close to criticality. Comparing both techniques reveals a growing discrepancy between the finite 2&#916; and the threshold energy for electromagnetic absorption, which vanishes critically towards the superconductor&#8211;insulator transition. We identify the excess absorption below 2&#916; as strong evidence of the Higgs mode in two-dimensional quantum critical superconductors.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel Sherman"", ""Uwe S.
