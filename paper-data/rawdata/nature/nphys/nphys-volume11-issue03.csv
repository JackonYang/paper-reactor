article,Measurements on the reality of the wavefunction,"<p>Quantum mechanics is an outstandingly successful description of nature, underpinning fields from biology through chemistry to physics. At its heart is the quantum wavefunction, the central tool for describing quantum systems. Yet it is still unclear what the wavefunction actually is: does it merely represent our limited knowledge of a system, or is it in direct correspondence to reality? Recent no-go theorems argued that if there was any objective reality, then the wavefunction must be real. However, that conclusion relied on debatable assumptions. Here we follow a different approach without these assumptions and experimentally bound the degree to which knowledge interpretations can explain quantum phenomena. Using single photons, we find that no knowledge interpretation can fully explain the limited distinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states in three and four dimensions. Assuming that a notion of objective reality exists, our results thus strengthen the view that the wavefunction should directly correspond to this reality.</p>",[],False,"[""M. Ringbauer"", ""B.

article,Experimental realization of long-distance entanglement between spins in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains,"<p>Entanglement is a concept that has defied common sense since the discovery of quantum mechanics. Two particles are said to be entangled when the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently, no matter how far apart in space and time the two particles are. We demonstrate experimentally that unpaired spins separated by several hundred &#229;ngstr&#246;m entangle through a collection of spin singlets made up of antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in a bulk material. Low-temperature magnetization and specific heat studies as a function of magnetic field reveal the occurrence of very dilute spin dimers and at least two quantum phase transitions related to the breaking of excited local triplets. The mechanism at the origin of the unpaired spins inside the quantum chains is the inter-modulation potential between two sublattices, and may be replicated using well-designed synthetic multilayers.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

article,Self-accelerating Dirac particles and prolonging the lifetime of relativistic fermions,"<p>The Aharonov&#8211;Bohm effect predicts that two parts of the electron wavefunction can accumulate a phase difference even when they are confined to a region in space with zero electromagnetic field. Here we show that engineering the wavefunction of electrons, as accelerating shape-invariant solutions of the potential-free Dirac equation, fundamentally acts as a force and the electrons accumulate an Aharonov&#8211;Bohm-type phase&#8212;which is equivalent to a change in the proper time and is related to the twin-paradox gedanken experiment. This implies that fundamental relativistic effects such as length contraction and time dilation can be engineered by properly tailoring the initial conditions. As an example, we suggest the possibility of extending the lifetime of decaying particles, such as an unstable hydrogen isotope, or altering other decay processes. We find these shape-preserving Dirac wavefunctions to be part of a family of accelerating quantum particles, which includes massive/massless fermions/bosons of any spin.</p>",[],False,"[""Ido Kaminer"", ""Jonathan Nemirovsky"", ""Mikael Rechtsman"", ""Rivka Bekenstein"", ""Mordechai Segev""]","Kaminer, I., Nemirovsky, J., Rechtsman, M. et al.

article,Photon transport enhanced by transverse Anderson localization in disordered superlattices,"<p>Controlling the flow of light at subwavelength scales provides access to functionalities such as negative or zero index of refraction, transformation optics, cloaking, metamaterials and slow light, but diffraction effects severely restrict our ability to control light on such scales. Here we report the photon transport and collimation enhanced by transverse Anderson localization in chip-scale dispersion-engineered anisotropic media. We demonstrate a photonic crystal superlattice structure in which diffraction is nearly completely arrested by cascaded resonant tunnelling through transverse guided resonances. By modifying the geometry of more than 4,000 scatterers in the superlattices we add structural disorder controllably and uncover the mechanism of disorder-induced transverse localization. Arrested spatial divergence is captured in the power-law scaling, along with exponential asymmetric mode profiles and enhanced collimation bandwidths for increasing disorder. With increasing disorder, we observe the crossover from cascaded guided resonances into the transverse localization regime, beyond both the ballistic and diffusive transport of photons.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

article,Non-reciprocal Brillouin scattering induced transparency,"<p>Electromagnetically induced transparency provides a powerful mechanism for controlling light propagation in a dielectric medium, and for producing slow and fast light. Electromagnetically induced transparency traditionally arises from destructive interference induced by a non-radiative coherence in an atomic system. Stimulated Brillouin scattering of light from propagating hypersonic acoustic waves has also been used successfully for the generation of slow and fast light. However, Electromagnetically induced transparency-type processes based on stimulated Brillouin scattering were considered infeasible because of the short coherence lifetime of hypersonic phonons. Here, we report a new Brillouin scattering induced transparency phenomenon generated by acousto-optic interaction of light with long-lived propagating phonons in a silica resonator. We demonstrate that Brillouin scattering induced transparency is uniquely non-reciprocal owing to the propagating acoustic wave and accompanying momentum conservation requirement. We also show that Brillouin scattering induced transparency enables ultralow-power ultralow-footprint slow-light generation with delay-bandwidth product comparable to state-of-the-art stimulated Brillouin scattering systems.</p>",[],False,"[""JunHwan Kim"", ""Mark C.

article,Electrical control of optical emitter relaxation pathways enabled by graphene,"<p>Controlling the energy flow processes and the associated energy relaxation rates of a light emitter is of fundamental interest and has many applications in the fields of quantum optics, photovoltaics, photodetection, biosensing and light emission. Advanced dielectric, semiconductor and metallic systems have been developed to tailor the interaction between an emitter and its environment. However, active control of the energy flow from an emitter into optical, electronic or plasmonic excitations has remained challenging. Here, we demonstrate in situ electrical control of the relaxation pathways of excited erbium ions, which emit light at the technologically relevant telecommunication wavelength of 1.5 &#956;m. By placing the erbium at a few nanometres distance from graphene, we modify the relaxation rate by more than a factor of three, and control whether the emitter decays into electron&#8211;hole pairs, emitted photons or graphene near-infrared plasmons, confined to &lt;15 nm from the graphene sheet. These capabilities to dictate optical energy transfer processes through electrical control of the local density of optical states constitute a new paradigm for active (quantum) photonics and can be applied using any combination of light emitters and two-dimensional materials.</p>",[],False,"[""K.
