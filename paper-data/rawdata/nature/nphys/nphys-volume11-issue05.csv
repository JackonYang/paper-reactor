progress article,Fractionalized topological insulators,"<p>Topological insulators have emerged as a major topic of condensed matter physics research, with several novel applications proposed. Although there are now a number of established experimental examples of materials in this class, all of them can be described by theories based on electronic band structure, which implies that they do not possess electronic correlations strong enough to fundamentally change this theoretical description. Here, we review recent theoretical progress in the description of a class of strongly correlated topological insulators&#8212;fractionalized topological insulators&#8212;where band theory fails owing to the fractionalization of the electron into other degrees of freedom.</p>",[],False,"[""Joseph Maciejko"", ""Gregory A.

article,A quantum advantage for inferring causal structure,"<p>The problem of inferring causal relations from observed correlations is relevant to a wide variety of scientific disciplines. Yet given the correlations between just two classical variables, it is impossible to determine whether they arose from a causal influence of one on the other or a common cause influencing both. Only a randomized trial can settle the issue. Here we consider the problem of causal inference for quantum variables. We show that the analogue of a randomized trial, causal tomography, yields a complete solution. We also show that, in contrast to the classical case, one can sometimes infer the causal structure from observations alone. We implement a quantum-optical experiment wherein we control the causal relation between two optical modes, and two measurement schemes&#8212;with and without randomization&#8212;that extract this relation from the observed correlations. Our results show that entanglement and quantum coherence provide an advantage for causal inference.</p>",[],False,"[""Katja Ried"", ""Megan Agnew"", ""Lydia Vermeyden"", ""Dominik Janzing"", ""Robert W.

article,Snapshots of the retarded interaction of charge carriers with ultrafast fluctuations in cuprates,"<p>One of the pivotal questions in the physics of high-temperature superconductors is whether the low-energy dynamics of the charge carriers is mediated by bosons with a characteristic timescale. This issue has remained elusive as electronic correlations are expected to greatly accelerate the electron&#8211;boson scattering processes, confining them to the very femtosecond timescale that is hard to access even with state-of-the-art ultrafast techniques. Here we simultaneously push the time resolution and frequency range of transient reflectivity measurements up to an unprecedented level, enabling us to directly observe the &#8764;16 fs build-up of the effective electron&#8211;boson interaction in hole-doped copper oxides. This extremely fast timescale is in agreement with numerical calculations based on the t&#8211;J model and the repulsive Hubbard model, in which the relaxation of the photo-excited charges is achieved via inelastic scattering with short-range antiferromagnetic excitations.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

article,Magnetic field effects in hybrid perovskite devices,"<p>Magnetic field effects have been a successful tool for studying carrier dynamics in organic semiconductors as the weak spin&#8211;orbit coupling in these materials gives rise to long spin relaxation times. As the spin&#8211;orbit coupling is strong in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which are promising materials for photovoltaic and light-emitting applications, magnetic field effects are expected to be negligible in these optoelectronic devices. We measured significant magneto-photocurrent, magneto-electroluminescence and magneto-photoluminescence responses in hybrid perovskite devices and thin films, where the amplitude and shape are correlated to each other through the electron&#8211;hole lifetime, which depends on the perovskite film morphology. We attribute these responses to magnetic-field-induced spin-mixing of the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs with different g-factors&#8212;the &#916;g model. We validate this model by measuring large &#916;g (&#8764; 0.65) using field-induced circularly polarized photoluminescence, and electron&#8211;hole pair lifetime using picosecond pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy.</p>",[],False,"[""C.
