review article,Magnon spintronics,"<p>Magnon spintronics is the field of spintronics concerned with structures, devices and circuits that use spin currents carried by magnons. Magnons are the quanta of spin waves: the dynamic eigen-excitations of a magnetically ordered body. Analogous to electric currents, magnon-based currents can be used to carry, transport and process information. The use of magnons allows the implementation of novel wave-based computing technologies free from the drawbacks inherent to modern electronics, such as dissipation of energy due to Ohmic losses. Logic circuits based on wave interference and nonlinear wave interaction can be designed with much smaller footprints compared with conventional electron-based logic circuits. In this review, after an introduction into the basic properties of magnons and their handling, we discuss the inter-conversion between magnon currents and electron-carried spin and charge currents; and concepts and experimental studies of magnon-based computing&#160;circuits.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Role of transparency of platinum–ferromagnet interfaces in determining the intrinsic magnitude of the spin Hall effect,"<p>The spin Hall effect converts charge current to pure spin currents in orthogonal directions in materials that have significant spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The efficiency of the conversion is described by the spin Hall angle (SHA). The SHA can most readily be inferred by using the generated spin currents to excite or rotate the magnetization of ferromagnetic films or nano-elements via spin-transfer torques. Some of the largest spin-torque-derived spin Hall angles (ST-SHA) have been reported in platinum. Here we show, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, that the transparency of the Pt&#8211;ferromagnet interface to the spin current plays a central role in determining the magnitude of the ST-SHA. We measure a much larger ST-SHA in Pt/cobalt (&#8764;0.11) compared to Pt/permalloy (&#8764;0.05) bilayers when the interfaces are assumed to be completely transparent. Taking into account the transparency of these interfaces, as derived from spin-mixing conductances, we find that the intrinsic SHA in platinum has a much higher value of 0.19 &#177; 0.04 as compared to the ST-SHA. The importance of the interface transparency is further exemplified by the insertion of atomically thin magnetic layers at the Pt/permalloy interface that we show strongly modulates the magnitude of the ST-SHA.</p>",[],False,"[""Weifeng Zhang"", ""Wei Han"", ""Xin Jiang"", ""See-Hun Yang"", ""Stuart S.

article,Interpreting attoclock measurements of tunnelling times,"<p>Resolving in time the dynamics of light absorption by atoms and molecules, and the electronic rearrangement this induces, is among the most challenging goals of attosecond spectroscopy. The attoclock is an elegant approach to this problem, which encodes ionization times in the strong-field regime. However, the accurate reconstruction of these times from experimental data presents a formidable theoretical task. Here, we solve this problem by combining analytical theory with ab initio numerical simulations. We apply our theory to numerical attoclock experiments on the hydrogen atom to extract ionization time delays and analyse their nature. Strong-field ionization is often viewed as optical tunnelling through the barrier created by the field and the core potential. We show that, in the hydrogen atom, optical tunnelling is instantaneous. We also show how calibrating the attoclock using the hydrogen atom opens the way to identifying possible delays associated with multielectron dynamics during strong-field&#160;ionization.</p>",[],False,"[""Lisa Torlina"", ""Felipe Morales"", ""Jivesh Kaushal"", ""Igor Ivanov"", ""Anatoli Kheifets"", ""Alejandro Zielinski"", ""Armin Scrinzi"", ""Harm Geert Muller"", ""Suren Sukiasyan"", ""Misha Ivanov"", ""Olga Smirnova""]","Torlina, L., Morales, F., Kaushal, J. et al.

article,Energy flow in quantum critical systems far from equilibrium,"<p>Characterizing the behaviour of strongly coupled quantum systems out of equilibrium is a cardinal challenge for both theory and experiment. With diverse applications ranging from the dynamics of the quark&#8211;gluon plasma to transport in novel states of quantum matter, establishing universal results and organizing principles out of equilibrium is crucial. We present a universal description of energy transport between quantum critical heat baths in arbitrary dimension. The current-carrying non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) is a Lorentz-boosted thermal state. In the context of gauge/gravity duality this reveals an intimate correspondence between far-from-equilibrium transport and black hole uniqueness theorems. We provide analytical expressions for the energy current and the generating function of energy current fluctuations, together with predictions for&#160;experiment.</p>",[],False,"[""M. J.
