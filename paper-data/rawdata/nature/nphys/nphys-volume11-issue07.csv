review article,Anomalous critical and supercritical phenomena in explosive percolation,"<p>The emergence of large-scale connectivity on an underlying network or lattice, the so-called percolation transition, has a profound impact on the system&#8217;s macroscopic behaviours. There is thus great interest in controlling the location of the percolation transition to either enhance or delay its onset and, more generally, in understanding the consequences of such control interventions. Here we review explosive percolation, the sudden emergence of large-scale connectivity that results from repeated, small interventions designed to delay the percolation transition. These transitions exhibit drastic, unanticipated and exciting consequences that make explosive percolation an emerging paradigm for modelling real-world systems ranging from social networks to nanotubes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Computer Science and Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA', 'authors': ['Raissa M.

article,Measurement of the mobility edge for 3D Anderson localization,"<p>Anderson localization is a universal phenomenon affecting non-interacting quantum particles in a disordered environment. In three spatial dimensions, theory predicts a quantum phase transition from localization to diffusion at a critical energy, the mobility edge, which depends on the disorder strength. Although it has been recognized already long ago as a prominent feature of disordered systems, a complete experimental characterization of the mobility edge is still missing. Here we report the measurement of the mobility edge for ultracold atoms in a disordered potential created by laser speckles. We are able to control both the disorder strength and the energy of the system, so as to probe the position of the localization threshold in the disorder&#8211;energy plane. Our results might allow a direct experiment&#8211;theory comparison, which is a prerequisite to study the even more challenging problem of disorder and interactions.</p>",,"[{'address': 'LENS and Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia, Universitá di Firenze, Via N.

article,Nonlocal adiabatic response of a localized system to local manipulations,"<p>We examine the response of a system localized by disorder to a time-dependent local perturbation that varies smoothly with a characteristic timescale &#964;. We find that such a perturbation induces a nonlocal response, involving a rearrangement of conserved quantities over a length scale &#8764;ln&#8201;&#964;. This effect lies beyond linear response, is absent in undisordered insulators and highlights the remarkable subtlety of localized phases. The effect is common to both single-particle and many-body localized phases. Our results have implications for numerous fields, including topological quantum computation in quantum Hall systems, quantum control in disordered environments, and time-dependent localized systems. For example, they indicate that attempts to braid quasiparticles in quantum Hall systems or Majorana nanowires will not succeed if the manipulations are performed asymptotically slowly, and thus using such platforms for topological quantum computation will require considerable engineering. They also establish that disorder-localized insulators suffer from a statistical orthogonality catastrophe.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA', 'authors': ['Vedika Khemani', '\xa0&\xa0S.

article,A polynomial time algorithm for the ground state of one-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians,"<p>The density matrix renormalization group method has been extensively used to study the ground state of 1D many-body systems since its introduction two decades ago. In spite of its wide use, this heuristic method is known to fail in certain cases and no certifiably correct implementation is known, leaving researchers faced with an ever-growing toolbox of heuristics, none of which is guaranteed to succeed. Here we develop a polynomial time algorithm that provably finds the ground state of any 1D quantum system described by a gapped local Hamiltonian with constant ground-state energy. The algorithm is based on a framework that combines recently discovered structural features of gapped 1D systems with an efficient construction of a class of operators called approximate ground-state projections (AGSPs). The combination of these tools yields a method that is guaranteed to succeed in all 1D gapped systems. An AGSP-centric approach may help guide the search for algorithms for more general quantum systems, including for the central challenge of 2D systems, where even heuristic methods have had more limited success.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, USA', 'authors': ['Zeph Landau', '\xa0&\xa0Umesh Vazirani']}, {'address': 'Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA', 'authors': ['Thomas Vidick']}]",False,"['Zeph Landau', 'Umesh Vazirani', 'Thomas Vidick']","Landau, Z., Vazirani, U. & Vidick, T.

article,Unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance in ferromagnet/normal metal bilayers,"<p>Magnetoresistive effects are usually invariant on inversion of the magnetization direction. In non-centrosymmetric conductors, however, nonlinear resistive terms can give rise to a current dependence that is quadratic in the applied voltage and linear in the magnetization. Here we demonstrate that such conditions are realized in simple bilayer metal films where the spin&#8211;orbit interaction and spin-dependent scattering couple the current-induced spin accumulation to the electrical conductivity. We show that the longitudinal resistance of Ta|Co and Pt|Co bilayers changes when reversing the polarity of the current or the sign of the magnetization. This unidirectional magnetoresistance scales linearly with current density and has opposite sign in Ta and Pt, which we associate with the modification of the interface scattering potential induced by the spin Hall effect in these materials. Our results suggest a route to control the resistance and detect magnetization switching in spintronic devices using a two-terminal geometry, which applies also to heterostructures including topological insulators.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials, ETH Zürich, Hönggerbergring 64 CH-8093 Zürich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Can Onur Avci', ',\xa0Kevin Garello', ',\xa0Abhijit Ghosh', ',\xa0Mihai Gabureac', ',\xa0Santos F.

article,Thermal spin-transfer torque driven by the spin-dependent Seebeck effect in metallic spin-valves,"<p>The coupling of spin and heat gives rise to new physical phenomena in nanoscale spin devices. In particular, spin-transfer torque (STT) driven by thermal transport provides a new way to manipulate local magnetization. We quantify thermal STT in metallic spin-valve structures using an intense and ultrafast heat current created by picosecond pulses of laser light. Our result shows that thermal STT consists of demagnetization-driven and spin-dependent Seebeck effect (SDSE)-driven components; the SDSE-driven STT becomes dominant after 3 ps. The sign and magnitude of the SDSE-driven STT can be controlled by the composition of a ferromagnetic layer and the thickness of a heat sink layer.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Materials Research Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois\xa061801, USA', 'authors': ['Gyung-Min Choi', '\xa0&\xa0David G.

article,Direct measurement of the exciton binding energy and effective masses for charge carriers in organic–inorganic tri-halide perovskites,"<p>Solar cells based on the organic&#8211;inorganic tri-halide perovskite family of materials have shown significant progress recently, offering the prospect of low-cost solar energy from devices that are very simple to process. Fundamental to understanding the operation of these devices is the exciton binding energy, which has proved both difficult to measure directly and controversial. We demonstrate that by using very high magnetic fields it is possible to make an accurate and direct spectroscopic measurement of the exciton binding energy, which we find to be only 16 meV at low temperatures, over three times smaller than has been previously assumed. In the room-temperature phase we show that the binding energy falls to even smaller values of only a few millielectronvolts, which explains their excellent device performance as being due to spontaneous free-carrier generation following light absorption. Additionally, we determine the excitonic reduced effective mass to be 0.104m<sub>e</sub> (where m<sub>e</sub> is the electron mass), significantly smaller than previously estimated experimentally but in good agreement with recent calculations. Our work provides crucial information about the photophysics of these materials, which will in turn allow improved optoelectronic device operation and better understanding of their electronic properties.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire National des Champs Magnetiques Intenses, CNRS-UJF-UPS-INSA, 143 Avenue de Rangueil 31400 Toulouse, France', 'authors': ['Atsuhiko Miyata', ',\xa0Anatolie Mitioglu', ',\xa0Paulina Plochocka', '\xa0&\xa0Oliver Portugall']}, {'address': 'University of Oxford, Clarendon Laboratory, Parks Road Oxford OX1 3PU, UK', 'authors': ['Jacob Tse-Wei Wang', ',\xa0Samuel D.

article,Synchronous universal droplet logic and control,"<p>Droplets are versatile digital materials; they can be produced at high throughput, perform chemical reactions as miniature beakers and carry biological entities. Droplets have been manipulated with electric, optical, acoustic and magnetic forces, but all these methods use serial controls to address individual droplets. An alternative is algorithmic manipulation based on logic operations that automatically compute where droplets are stored or directed, thereby enabling parallel control. However, logic previously implemented in low-Reynolds-number droplet hydrodynamics is asynchronous and thus prone to errors that prevent scaling up the complexity of logic operations. Here we present a platform for error-free physical computation via synchronous universal logic. Our platform uses a rotating magnetic field that enables parallel manipulation of arbitrary numbers of ferrofluid droplets on permalloy tracks. Through the coupling of magnetic and hydrodynamic interaction forces between droplets, we developed AND, OR, XOR, NOT and NAND logic gates, fanouts, a full adder, a flip-flop and a finite-state machine. Our platform enables large-scale integration of droplet logic, analogous to the scaling seen in digital electronics, and opens new avenues in mesoscale material processing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, California 94305, USA', 'authors': ['Georgios Katsikis', '\xa0&\xa0James S.

article,Percolation in real interdependent networks,"<p>The function of a real network depends not only on the reliability of its own components, but is affected also by the simultaneous operation of other real networks coupled with it. Whereas theoretical methods of direct applicability to real isolated networks exist, the frameworks developed so far in percolation theory for interdependent network layers are of little help in practical contexts, as they are suited only for special models in the limit of infinite size. Here, we introduce a set of heuristic equations that takes as inputs the adjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the interconnected network. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in interdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these systems into uncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the layers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected network undergoes a smooth percolation transition. Conversely, if the intersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition becomes abrupt even in small networks. We provide examples of real systems that have developed interdependent networks sharing cores of &#8216;high quality&#8217; edges to prevent catastrophic failures.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47408, USA', 'authors': ['Filippo Radicchi']}]",False,['Filippo Radicchi'],"Radicchi, F.
