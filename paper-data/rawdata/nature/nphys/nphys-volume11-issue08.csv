article,Universal decoherence due to gravitational time dilation,"<p>The physics of low-energy quantum systems is usually studied without explicit consideration of the background spacetime. Phenomena inherent to quantum theory in curved spacetime, such as Hawking radiation, are typically assumed to be relevant only for extreme physical conditions: at high energies and in strong gravitational fields. Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the presence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to the decoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal coupling between the internal degrees of freedom and the centre of mass of a composite particle. The resulting correlations lead to decoherence in the particle position, even without any external environment. We also show that the weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to affect micrometre-scale objects. Gravity can therefore account for the emergence of classicality and this effect could in principle be tested in future matter-wave experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Igor Pikovski"", ""Magdalena Zych"", ""Fabio Costa"", ""\u010caslav Brukner""]","Pikovski, I., Zych, M., Costa, F. et al.

article,Pressure is not a state function for generic active fluids,"<p>Pressure is the mechanical force per unit area that a confined system exerts on its container. In thermal equilibrium, it depends only on bulk properties&#8212;such as density and temperature&#8212;through an equation of state. Here we show that in a wide class of active systems the pressure depends on the precise interactions between the active particles and the confining walls. In general, therefore, active fluids have no equation of state. Their mechanical pressure exhibits anomalous properties that defy the familiar thermodynamic reasoning that holds in equilibrium. The pressure remains a function of state, however, in some specific and well-studied active models that tacitly restrict the character of the particle&#8211;wall and/or particle&#8211;particle&#160;interactions.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

This class of system includes the valence bond crystals and quantum spin liquids, in which spin singlets&#8212;the basic unit of entangled pairs of spins&#8212;form solids and liquids, respectively. In both phases, geometrical frustration is expected to play a role. So far, very few candidate quantum-spin-liquid materials have been found, including an organic Mott insulator, &#954;-(ET)<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>3</sub>, which is based on a regular triangular lattice.

article,Translation correlations in anisotropically scattering media,"<p>Controlling light propagation across scattering media by wavefront shaping holds great promise for a wide range of communications and imaging applications. But, finding the right shape for the wavefront is a challenge when the mapping between input and output scattered wavefronts (that is, the transmission matrix) is not known. Correlations in transmission matrices, especially the so-called memory effect, have been exploited to address this limitation. However, the traditional memory effect applies to thin scattering layers at a distance from the target, which precludes its use within thick scattering media, such as fog and biological tissue. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally verify new transmission matrix correlations within thick anisotropically scattering media, with important implications for biomedical imaging and adaptive&#160;optics.</p>",[],False,"[""Benjamin Judkewitz"", ""Roarke Horstmeyer"", ""Ivo M.

article,Secondary reconnection sites in reconnection-generated flux ropes and reconnection fronts,"<p>The primary target of the Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission is the electron-scale diffusion layer around reconnection sites. Here we study where these regions are found in full three-dimensional simulations. In two dimensions the sites of electron diffusion, defined as the regions where magnetic topology changes and electrons move with respect to the magnetic field lines, are located near the reconnection site. But in three dimensions we find that the reconnection exhaust far from the primary reconnection site also becomes host to secondary reconnection sites. Four diagnostics are used to demonstrate the point: the direct observation of topology impossible without secondary reconnection, the direct measurement of topological field line breakage, the measurement of electron jets emerging from secondary reconnection regions, and the violation of the frozen-in condition. We conclude that secondary reconnection occurs in a large part of the exhaust, providing many more chances for MMS to find itself in the right region to hit its target.</p>",[],False,"[""Giovanni Lapenta"", ""Stefano Markidis"", ""Martin V.
