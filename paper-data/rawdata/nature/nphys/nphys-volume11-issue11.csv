progress article,Polymer physics of intracellular phase transitions,"<p>Intracellular organelles are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that are made up of proteins and RNA. These organelles play key biological roles, by compartmentalizing the cell to enable spatiotemporal control of biological reactions. Recent studies suggest that membrane-less intracellular compartments are multicomponent viscous liquid droplets that form via phase separation. Proteins that have an intrinsic tendency for being conformationally heterogeneous seem to be the main drivers of liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation in the cell. These findings highlight the relevance of classical concepts from the physics of polymeric phase transitions for understanding the assembly of intracellular membrane-less compartments. However, applying these concepts is challenging, given the heteropolymeric nature of protein sequences, the complex intracellular environment, and non-equilibrium features intrinsic to cells. This provides new opportunities for adapting established theories and for the emergence of new physics.</p>",[],False,"[""Clifford\u00a0P. Brangwynne"", ""Peter Tompa"", ""Rohit\u00a0V.

There are cases, however, such as ultracold trapped Fermi gases and the crust of neutron stars, where finite-size effects make it complex to account for the geometrical arrangement of vortices. Here, we self-consistently generate these arrays of vortices at zero and finite temperature through a microscopic description of the non-homogeneous superfluid based on a differential equation for the local order parameter, obtained by coarse graining the Bogoliubov&#8211;de Gennes (BdG) equations. In this way, the strength of the inter-particle interaction is varied along the BCS&#8211;BEC crossover, from largely overlapping Cooper pairs in the Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) limit to dilute composite bosons in the Bose&#8211;Einstein condensed (BEC) limit.

article,Plain s-wave superconductivity in single-layer FeSe on SrTiO3 probed by scanning tunnelling microscopy,"<p>Single-layer FeSe film on SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(001) has recently come to the fore as an interfacial superconducting system, with a transition temperature that is significantly enhanced with respect to bulk FeSe. The mechanism for this enhancement, and indeed for the superconductivity itself, is therefore of great interest. Although the film has a simple Fermi surface topology, its pairing symmetry is unclear. By using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy, we have systematically investigated the superconductivity of single-layer FeSe/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> films, and report a fully gapped tunnelling spectrum and magnetic vortex lattice in the film. Quasi-particle interference patterns reveal scatterings between and within the electron pockets, and put constraints on possible pairing symmetries. By introducing impurity atoms onto the sample, we show that magnetic impurities such as Cr and Mn can locally suppress the superconductivity, but non-magnetic impurities (Zn, Ag and K) do not. Our results indicate that single-layer FeSe/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> has a plain s-wave pairing symmetry, with an order parameter that has the same phase on all Fermi surface sections.</p>",[],False,"[""Q.

article,Effect of magnetic frustration on nematicity and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides,"<p>Over the past few years iron chalcogenides have been intensively studied as part of the wider family of iron-based superconductors, with many intriguing results reported so far on intercalated and monolayer FeSe. Nevertheless, bulk FeSe itself remains an unusual case when compared with pnictogen-based iron superconductors, and may hold clues to understanding the more exotic derivatives of the FeSe system. The FeSe phase diagram is distinct from the pnictides: the orthorhombic distortion, which is likely to be of a &#8216;spin-nematic&#8217; nature in numerous pnictides, is not accompanied by magnetic order in FeSe, and the superconducting transition temperature T<sub>c</sub> rises significantly with pressure before decreasing. Here we show that the magnetic interactions in FeSe, as opposed to most pnictides, demonstrate an unusual and unanticipated frustration, which suppresses magnetic (but not nematic) order, triggers ferro-orbital order in the nematic phase and can naturally explain the non-monotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting critical temperature T<sub>c</sub>(P).</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Nematicity and quantum paramagnetism in FeSe,"<p>In common with other iron-based high-temperature superconductors, FeSe exhibits a transition to a &#8216;nematic&#8217; phase below 90&#8201;K in which the crystal rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken. However, the absence of strong low-frequency magnetic fluctuations near or above the transition has been interpreted as implying the primacy of orbital ordering. In contrast, we establish that quantum fluctuations of spin-1 local moments with strongly frustrated exchange interactions can lead to a nematic quantum paramagnetic phase consistent with the observations in FeSe. We show that this phase is a fundamental expression of the existence of a Berry&#8217;s phase associated with the topological defects of a N&#233;el antiferromagnet, in a manner analogous to that which gives rise to valence bond crystal order for spin-1/2 systems. We present an exactly solvable model realizing the nematic quantum paramagnetic phase, discuss its relation with the spin-1 J<sub>1</sub>&#8211;J<sub>2</sub> model, and construct a field theory of the Landau-forbidden transition between the N&#233;el state and this nematic quantum paramagnet.</p>",[],False,"[""Fa Wang"", ""Steven A.

At high intensities, such as produced at free-electron lasers, nonlinearities can become important, and the probe may no longer be considered weak. Here we report the observation of one of the most fundamental nonlinear X-ray&#8211;matter interactions: the concerted nonlinear Compton scattering of two identical hard X-ray photons producing a single higher-energy photon.&#160;The X-ray intensity reached 4 &#215; 10<sup>20</sup>&#8201;W&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>, corresponding to an electric field well above the atomic unit of strength and within almost four orders of magnitude of the quantum-electrodynamic critical field. We measure a signal from solid beryllium that scales quadratically in intensity, consistent with simultaneous non-resonant two-photon scattering from nearly-free electrons.

For glassy systems, it has been extended to the non-equilibrium regime, showing up as an effective quantity in a modified version of the fluctuation&#8211;dissipation theorem. However, experimental evidence supporting this definition remains scarce. Here, we present the first direct experimental demonstration of the effective temperature by measuring correlations and responses in single molecules in non-equilibrium steady states generated under external random forces. We combine experiment, analytical theory and simulations for systems with different levels of complexity, ranging from a single bead in an optical trap to two-state and multiple-state DNA hairpins. From these data, we extract a unifying picture for the existence of an effective temperature based on the relative order of various timescales characterizing intrinsic relaxation and external driving.
