article,Probing the quantum vacuum with an artificial atom in front of a mirror,"<p>Quantum fluctuations of the vacuum are both a surprising and fundamental phenomenon of nature. Understood as virtual photons, they still have a very real impact, for instance, in the Casimir effects and the lifetimes of atoms. Engineering vacuum fluctuations is therefore becoming increasingly important to emerging technologies. Here, we shape vacuum fluctuations using a superconducting circuit analogue of a mirror, creating regions in space where they are suppressed. Moving an artificial atom through these regions and measuring the spontaneous emission lifetime of the atom provides us with the spectral density of the vacuum fluctuations. Using the paradigm of waveguide quantum electrodynamics, we significantly improve over previous studies of the interaction of an atom with its mirror image, observing a spectral density as low as 0.02 quanta, a factor of 50 below the mirrorless result. This demonstrates that we can hide the atom from the vacuum, even though it is exposed in free&#160;space.</p>",[],False,"[""I.-C. Hoi"", ""A. F. Kockum"", ""L. Tornberg"", ""A. Pourkabirian"", ""G.

article,Entanglement pre-thermalization in a one-dimensional Bose gas,"<p>An isolated quantum system often shows relaxation to a quasi-stationary state before reaching thermal equilibrium. Such a pre-thermalized state was observed in recent experiments in a one-dimensional Bose gas after it had been coherently split into two. Although the existence of local conserved quantities is usually considered to be the key ingredient of pre-thermalization, the question of whether non-local correlations between the subsystems can influence pre-thermalization of the entire system has remained unanswered. Here we study the dynamics of coherently split one-dimensional Bose gases and find that the initial entanglement combined with energy degeneracy due to parity and translation invariance strongly affects the long-term behaviour of the system. The mechanism of this entanglement pre-thermalization is quite general and not restricted to one-dimensional Bose gases. In view of recent experiments with a small and well-defined number of ultracold atoms, our predictions based on exact few-body calculations could be tested in experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Eriko Kaminishi"", ""Takashi Mori"", ""Tatsuhiko N.

article,Resonant tunnelling between the chiral Landau states of twisted graphene lattices,"<p>A class of multilayered functional materials has recently emerged in which the component atomic layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces that preserve the structural integrity and physical properties of each layer. An exemplar of such a structure is a transistor device in which relativistic Dirac fermions can resonantly tunnel through a boron nitride barrier, a few atomic layers thick, sandwiched between two graphene electrodes. An applied magnetic field quantizes graphene&#8217;s gapless conduction and valence band states into discrete Landau levels, allowing us to resolve individual inter-Landau-level transitions and thereby demonstrate that the energy, momentum and chiral properties of the electrons are conserved in the tunnelling process. We also demonstrate that the change in the semiclassical cyclotron trajectories, following an inter-layer tunnelling event, is analogous to the case of intra-layer Klein tunnelling.</p>",[],False,"[""M.\u00a0T.

article,Orbitally driven giant phonon anharmonicity in SnSe,"<p>Understanding elementary excitations and their couplings in condensed matter systems is critical for developing better energy-conversion devices. In thermoelectric materials, the heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency is directly improved by suppressing the propagation of phonon quasiparticles responsible for macroscopic thermal transport. The current record material for thermoelectric conversion efficiency, SnSe, has an ultralow thermal conductivity, but the mechanism behind the strong phonon scattering remains largely unknown. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements and first-principles simulations, we mapped the four-dimensional phonon dispersion surfaces of SnSe, and found the origin of the ionic-potential anharmonicity responsible for the unique properties of SnSe. We show that the giant phonon scattering arises from an unstable electronic structure, with orbital interactions leading to a ferroelectric-like lattice instability. The present results provide a microscopic picture connecting electronic structure and phonon anharmonicity in SnSe, and offers new insights on how electron&#8211;phonon and phonon&#8211;phonon interactions may lead to the realization of ultralow thermal conductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

article,Ferroelectricity in the multiferroic hexagonal manganites,"<p>Since their discovery in 1963 the hexagonal manganites have consolidated their role as exotic ferroelectrics with astonishing functionalities. Their introduction as room-temperature device ferroelectrics was followed by observations of giant flexoelectricity, multiferroicity with magnetoelectric domain and domain-wall coupling, protected vortex domain structures, topological domain-scaling behaviour and domain walls with tunable conductance and magnetism. Even after half a century, however, the emergence of the ferroelectric state has remained the subject of fierce debate. We resolve the interplay of electric polarization, topological trimerization and temperature by direct access to the polarization for temperatures up to 1,400&#8201;K. Nonlinear optical experiments and piezoresponse force microscopy, complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, reveal a single phase transition with ferroelectricity determined by topology rather than electrostatics. Fundamental properties of the hexagonal manganites, including an explanation for the two-phase-transition controversy as a finite-size scaling effect, are derived from this and highlight why improper ferroelectrics are an inherent source of novel functionalities.</p>",[],False,"[""Martin Lilienblum"", ""Thomas Lottermoser"", ""Sebastian Manz"", ""Sverre M.

article,A density-independent rigidity transition in biological tissues,"<p>Cell migration is important in many biological processes, including embryonic development, cancer metastasis and wound healing. In these tissues, a cell&#8217;s motion is often strongly constrained by its neighbours, leading to glassy dynamics. Although self-propelled particle models exhibit a density-driven glass transition, this does not explain liquid-to-solid transitions in confluent tissues, where there are no gaps between cells and therefore the density is constant. Here we demonstrate the existence of a new type of rigidity transition that occurs in the well-studied vertex model for confluent tissue monolayers at constant density. We find that the onset of rigidity is governed by a model parameter that encodes single-cell properties such as cell&#8211;cell adhesion and cortical tension, providing an explanation for liquid-to-solid transitions in confluent tissues and making testable predictions about how these transitions differ from those in particulate matter.</p>",[],False,"[""Dapeng Bi"", ""J.
