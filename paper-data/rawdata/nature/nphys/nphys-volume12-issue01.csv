article,Entangling atomic spins with a Rydberg-dressed spin-flip blockade,"<p>Controlling the quantum entanglement between parts of a many-body system is key to unlocking the power of quantum technologies such as quantum computation, high-precision sensing, and the simulation of many-body physics. The spin degrees of freedom of ultracold neutral atoms in their ground electronic state provide a natural platform for such applications thanks to their long coherence times and the ability to control them with magneto-optical fields. However, the creation of strong coherent coupling between spins has been challenging. Here we demonstrate a strong and tunable Rydberg-dressed interaction between spins of individually trapped caesium atoms with energy shifts of order 1 MHz in units of Planck&#8217;s constant. This interaction leads to a ground-state spin-flip blockade, whereby simultaneous hyperfine spin flips of two atoms are inhibited owing to their mutual interaction. We employ this spin-flip blockade to rapidly produce single-step Bell-state entanglement between two atoms with a fidelity &#8805;81(2)%.</p>",[],False,"[""Y.-Y. Jau"", ""A. M. Hankin"", ""T.

article,Microscopic theory and quantum simulation of atomic heat transport,"<p>Quantum simulation methods based on electronic-structure theory are deemed unfit to cope with atomic heat transport within the Green&#8211;Kubo formalism, because quantum-mechanical energy densities and currents are inherently ill-defined at the atomic scale. We show that, although this difficulty would also affect classical simulations, thermal conductivity is indeed insensitive to such ill-definedness by virtue of a kind of gauge invariance resulting from energy extensivity and conservation. On the basis of these findings, we derive an expression for the adiabatic energy flux from density-functional theory, which allows heat transport to be simulated using ab initio equilibrium molecular dynamics. Our methodology is demonstrated by comparing its predictions to those of classical equilibrium and ab initio non-equilibrium (M&#252;ller&#8211;Plathe) simulations for a liquid-argon model, and by applying it to heavy water at ambient conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Aris Marcolongo"", ""Paolo Umari"", ""Stefano Baroni""]","Marcolongo, A., Umari, P. & Baroni, S.

article,Long-range p–d exchange interaction in a ferromagnet–semiconductor hybrid structure,"<p>Hybrid structures synthesized from different materials have attracted considerable attention because they may allow not only combination of the functionalities of the individual constituents but also mutual control of their properties. To obtain such a control an interaction between the components needs to be established. For coupling the magnetic properties, an exchange interaction has to be implemented which typically depends on wavefunction overlap and is therefore short-ranged, so that it may be compromised across the hybrid interface. Here we study a hybrid structure consisting of a ferromagnetic Co layer and a semiconducting CdTe quantum well, separated by a thin (Cd, Mg)Te barrier. In contrast to the expected p&#8211;d exchange that decreases exponentially with the wavefunction overlap of quantum well holes and magnetic atoms, we find a long-ranged, robust coupling that does not vary with barrier width up to more than 30&#8201;nm. We suggest that the resulting spin polarization of acceptor-bound holes is induced by an effective p&#8211;d exchange that is mediated by elliptically polarized phonons.</p>",[],False,"[""V. L.

article,Characterization of collective ground states in single-layer NbSe2,"<p>Layered transition metal dichalcogenides are ideal systems for exploring the effects of dimensionality on correlated electronic phases such as charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. In bulk NbSe<sub>2</sub> a CDW sets in at T<sub>CDW</sub> = 33&#8201;K and superconductivity sets in at T<sub>c</sub> = 7.2&#8201;K. Below T<sub>c</sub> these electronic states coexist but their microscopic formation mechanisms remain controversial. Here we present an electronic characterization study of a single two-dimensional (2D) layer of NbSe<sub>2</sub> by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and electrical transport measurements. We demonstrate that 3 &#215; 3 CDW order in NbSe<sub>2</sub> remains intact in two dimensions. Superconductivity also still remains in the 2D limit, but its onset temperature is depressed to 1.9&#8201;K. Our STS measurements at 5&#8201;K reveal a CDW gap of &#916; = 4&#8201;meV at the Fermi energy, which is accessible by means of STS owing to the removal of bands crossing the Fermi level for a single layer. Our observations are consistent with the simplified (compared to bulk) electronic structure of single-layer NbSe<sub>2</sub>, thus providing insight into CDW formation and superconductivity in this model strongly correlated system.</p>",[],False,"[""Miguel M.

article,Transmission of torque at the nanoscale,"<p>In macroscopic mechanical devices, torque is transmitted through gearwheels and clutches. In the construction of devices at the nanoscale, torque and its transmission through soft materials will be a key component. However, this regime is dominated by thermal fluctuations leading to dissipation. Here we demonstrate the principle of torque transmission for a disc-like colloidal assembly exhibiting clutch-like behaviour, driven by 27 particles in optical traps. These are translated on a circular path to form a rotating boundary that transmits torque to additional particles confined to the interior. We investigate this transmission and find that it is determined by solid-like or fluid-like behaviour of the device and a stick&#8211;slip mechanism reminiscent of macroscopic gearwheels slipping. The transmission behaviour is predominantly governed by the rotation rate of the boundary and the density of the confined system. We determine the efficiency of our device and thus optimize conditions to maximize power output.</p>",[],False,"[""Ian Williams"", ""Erdal C.
