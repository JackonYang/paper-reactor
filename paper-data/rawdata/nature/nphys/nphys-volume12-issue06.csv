article,Unexpectedly large charge radii of neutron-rich calcium isotopes,"<p>Despite being a complex many-body system, the atomic nucleus exhibits simple structures for certain &#8216;magic&#8217; numbers of protons and neutrons. The calcium chain in particular is both unique and puzzling: evidence of doubly magic features are known in <sup>40,48</sup>Ca, and recently suggested in two radioactive isotopes, <sup>52,54</sup>Ca. Although many properties of experimentally known calcium isotopes have been successfully described by nuclear theory, it is still a challenge to predict the evolution of their charge radii. Here we present the first measurements of the charge radii of <sup>49,51,52</sup>Ca, obtained from laser spectroscopy experiments at ISOLDE, CERN. The experimental results are complemented by state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. The large and unexpected increase of the size of the neutron-rich calcium isotopes beyond N = 28 challenges the doubly magic nature of <sup>52</sup>Ca and opens new intriguing questions on the evolution of nuclear sizes away from stability, which are of importance for our understanding of neutron-rich atomic nuclei.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

article,Evidence for universal relations describing a gas with p-wave interactions,"<p>In dilute gases, a set of universal relations, known as the contact relations, directly connects thermodynamics and microscopic properties. So far, they have been established only for interactions with s-wave symmetry&#8212;that is, without relative angular momentum. Here we report measurements of two new physical quantities, the p-wave contacts, and, using recently proposed relations, present evidence that they encode the universal aspects of p-wave interactions. Our experiments use an ultracold Fermi gas of <sup>40</sup>K, in which s-wave interactions are suppressed by polarizing the sample, whereas p-wave interactions are enhanced by working near a scattering resonance. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we study how correlations in the system develop after quenching the atoms into an interacting state. By combining quasi-steady-state measurements with new contact relations, we infer an attractive p-wave interaction energy as large as half the Fermi energy. Our results reveal new ways to understand and characterize the properties of a resonant p-wave quantum gas.</p>",[],False,"[""Christopher Luciuk"", ""Stefan Trotzky"", ""Scott Smale"", ""Zhenhua Yu"", ""Shizhong Zhang"", ""Joseph H.

article,Directional transport of high-temperature Janus droplets mediated by structural topography,"<p>Directed motion of liquid droplets is of considerable importance in various water and thermal management technologies. Although various methods to generate such motion have been developed at low temperature, they become rather ineffective at high temperature, where the droplet transits to a Leidenfrost state. In this state, it becomes challenging to control and direct the motion of the highly mobile droplets towards specific locations on the surface without compromising the effective heat transfer. Here we report that the wetting symmetry of a droplet can be broken at high temperature by creating two concurrent thermal states (Leidenfrost and contact-boiling) on a topographically patterned surface, thus engendering a preferential motion of a droplet towards the region with a higher heat transfer coefficient. The fundamental understanding and the ability to control the droplet dynamics at high temperature have promising applications in various systems requiring high thermal efficiency, operational security and fidelity.</p>",[],False,"[""Jing Li"", ""Youmin Hou"", ""Yahua Liu"", ""Chonglei Hao"", ""Minfei Li"", ""Manoj K.
