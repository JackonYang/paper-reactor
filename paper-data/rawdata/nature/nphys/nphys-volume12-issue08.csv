article,Measuring multipartite entanglement through dynamic susceptibilities,"<p>Entanglement is considered an essential resource in quantum technologies, and central to the understanding of quantum many-body physics. Developing protocols to detect and quantify the entanglement of many-particle quantum states is thus a key challenge for present experiments. Here, we show that the quantum Fisher information, a witness for genuinely multipartite entanglement, becomes measurable for thermal ensembles by means of the dynamic susceptibility&#8212;that is, with resources readily available in present cold atomic-gas and condensed-matter experiments. This establishes a connection between multipartite entanglement and many-body correlations contained in response functions, with immediate implications close to quantum phase transitions, where the quantum Fisher information becomes universal, allowing us to identify strongly entangled phase transitions with a divergent multipartite entanglement. We illustrate our framework using paradigmatic quantum Ising models, and point out potential signatures in optical-lattice experiments and strongly correlated&#160;materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Philipp Hauke"", ""Markus Heyl"", ""Luca Tagliacozzo"", ""Peter Zoller""]","Hauke, P., Heyl, M., Tagliacozzo, L. et al.

article,Generation and detection of atomic spin entanglement in optical lattices,"<p>Ultracold atoms in optical lattices hold promise for the creation of entangled states for quantum technologies. Here we report on the generation, manipulation and detection of atomic spin entanglement in an optical superlattice. Using a spin-dependent superlattice, atomic spins in the left or right sites can be individually addressed and coherently manipulated with near-unity fidelities by microwave pulses. The spin entanglement of the two atoms in the double wells of the superlattice is generated via the dynamical evolution governed by spin superexchange. By monitoring the collisional atom loss with in situ absorption imaging we measure the spin correlations of the atoms inside the double wells and obtain a lower bound on the entanglement fidelity of 0.79 &#177; 0.06, and a violation of a Bell&#8217;s inequality S = 2.21 &#177; 0.08.</p>",[],False,"[""Han-Ning Dai"", ""Bing Yang"", ""Andreas Reingruber"", ""Xiao-Fan Xu"", ""Xiao Jiang"", ""Yu-Ao Chen"", ""Zhen-Sheng Yuan"", ""Jian-Wei Pan""]","Dai, HN., Yang, B., Reingruber, A. et al.

article,Laser cooling and control of excitations in superfluid helium,"<p>Superfluidity is a quantum state of matter that exists macroscopically in helium at low temperatures. The elementary excitations in superfluid helium have been probed with great success using techniques such as neutron and light scattering. However, measurements of phonon excitations have so far been limited to average thermodynamic properties or the driven response far out of thermal equilibrium. Here, we use cavity optomechanics to probe the thermodynamics of phonon excitations in real time. Furthermore, strong light&#8211;matter interactions allow both laser cooling and amplification. This represents a new tool to observe and control superfluid excitations that may provide insight into phonon&#8211;phonon interactions, quantized vortices and two-dimensional phenomena such as the Berezinskii&#8211;Kosterlitz&#8211;Thouless transition. The third sound modes studied here also offer a pathway towards quantum optomechanics with thin superfluid films, including the prospect of femtogram masses, high mechanical quality factors, strong phonon&#8211;phonon and phonon&#8211;vortex interactions, and self-assembly into complex geometries with sub-nanometre feature size.</p>",[],False,"[""G.

article,Direct measurement of the propagation velocity of defects using coherent X-rays,"<p>The properties of artificially grown thin films are often strongly affected by the dynamic relationships between surface growth processes and subsurface structure. Coherent mixing of X-ray signals promises to provide an approach to better understand such processes. Here, we demonstrate the continuously variable mixing of surface and bulk scattering signals during real-time studies of sputter deposition of a-Si and a-WSi2 films by controlling the X-ray penetration and escape depths in coherent grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering. Under conditions where the X-ray signal comes from both the growth surface and the thin film bulk, oscillations in temporal correlations arise from coherent interference between scattering from stationary bulk features and from the advancing surface. We also observe evidence that elongated bulk features propagate upwards at the same velocity as the surface. Furthermore, a highly surface-sensitive mode is demonstrated that can access the surface dynamics independently of the subsurface structure.</p>",[],False,"[""Jeffrey G. Ulbrandt"", ""Meliha G.

These experiments have achieved the highest yield (26 &#177; 0.5&#8201;kJ) and stagnation pressures (&#8781;220 &#177; 40&#8201;Gbar) of any facility-based inertial confinement fusion experiments, although they are still short of the pressures required for ignition on the National Ignition Facility (&#8764;300&#8211;400&#8201;Gbar).

article,Coincidence of a high-fluence blazar outburst with a PeV-energy neutrino event,"<p>The astrophysical sources of the extraterrestrial, very high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube collaboration remain to be identified. Gamma-ray (&#947;-ray) blazars have been predicted to yield a cumulative neutrino signal exceeding the atmospheric background above energies of 100&#8201;TeV, assuming that both the neutrinos and the &#947;-ray photons are produced by accelerated protons in relativistic jets. As the background spectrum falls steeply with increasing energy, the individual events with the clearest signature of being of extraterrestrial origin are those at petaelectronvolt energies. Inside the large positional-uncertainty fields of the first two petaelectronvolt neutrinos detected by IceCube, the integrated emission of the blazar population has a sufficiently high electromagnetic flux to explain the detected IceCube events, but fluences of individual objects are too low to make an unambiguous source association. Here, we report that a major outburst of the blazar PKS&#160;B1424&#8211;418 occurred in temporal and positional coincidence with a third petaelectronvolt-energy neutrino event (HESE-35) detected by IceCube. On the basis of an analysis of the full sample of &#947;-ray blazars in the HESE-35 field, we show that the long-term average &#947;-ray emission of blazars as a class is in agreement with both the measured all-sky flux of petaelectronvolt neutrinos and the spectral slope of the IceCube signal. The outburst of PKS&#160;B1424&#8211;418 provides an energy output high enough to explain the observed petaelectronvolt event, suggestive of a direct physical association.</p>",[],False,"[""M.
