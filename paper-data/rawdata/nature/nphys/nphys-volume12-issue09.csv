article,Spin-rotation symmetry breaking in the superconducting state of CuxBi2Se3,"<p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking is an important concept for understanding physics ranging from the elementary particles to states of matter. For example, the superconducting state breaks global gauge symmetry, and unconventional superconductors can break further symmetries. In particular, spin-rotational symmetry is expected to be broken in spin-triplet superconductors. However, experimental evidence for such symmetry breaking has not been conclusively obtained so far in any candidate compounds. Here, using <sup>77</sup>Se nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, we show that spin-rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken in the hexagonal plane of the electron-doped topological insulator Cu<sub>0.3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> below the superconducting transition temperature T<sub>c</sub> = 3.4&#8201;K. Our results not only establish spin-triplet superconductivity in this compound, but may also serve to lay a foundation for the research of topological superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""K.

article,Room-temperature spin–orbit torque in NiMnSb,"<p>Materials that crystallize in diamond-related lattices, with Si and GaAs as their prime examples, are at the foundation of modern electronics. Simultaneously, inversion asymmetries in their crystal structure and relativistic spin&#8211;orbit coupling led to discoveries of non-equilibrium spin-polarization phenomena that are now extensively explored as an electrical means for manipulating magnetic moments in a variety of spintronic structures. Current research of these relativistic spin&#8211;orbit torques focuses primarily on magnetic transition-metal multilayers. The low-temperature diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ga, Mn)As, in which spin&#8211;orbit torques were initially discovered, has so far remained the only example showing the phenomenon among bulk non-centrosymmetric ferromagnets. Here we present a general framework, based on the complete set of crystallographic point groups, for identifying the potential presence and symmetry of spin&#8211;orbit torques in non-centrosymmetric crystals. Among the candidate room-temperature ferromagnets we chose to use NiMnSb, which is a member of the broad family of magnetic Heusler compounds. By performing all-electrical ferromagnetic resonance measurements in single-crystal epilayers of NiMnSb we detect room-temperature spin&#8211;orbit torques generated by effective fields of the expected symmetry and of a magnitude consistent with our ab initio calculations.</p>",[],False,"[""C.

article,Photo-spin-voltaic effect,"<p>The photo-voltaic effect typically occurs in semiconductors and involves photon-driven excitation of electrons from a valence band to a conduction band. In a region such as a p&#8211;n junction that has a built-in electric field, the excited electrons and holes diffuse in opposite directions, resulting in an electric voltage. This letter reports that a spin voltage can be created by photons in a non-magnetic metal that is in close proximity to a magnetic insulator: a photo-spin-voltaic effect. The experiments use platinum/magnetic insulator bilayer structures. On exposure to light, there occurs photon-driven, spin-dependent excitation of electrons in several platinum atomic layers near the platinum/magnetic insulator interface. The excited electrons and holes diffuse in different manners, and this gives rise to an effective spin voltage at the interface and a corresponding pure spin current that flows across the platinum.</p>",[],False,"[""David Ellsworth"", ""Lei Lu"", ""Jin Lan"", ""Houchen Chang"", ""Peng Li"", ""Zhe Wang"", ""Jun Hu"", ""Bryan Johnson"", ""Yuqi Bian"", ""Jiang Xiao"", ""Ruqian Wu"", ""Mingzhong Wu""]","Ellsworth, D., Lu, L., Lan, J. et al.

article,A chemically driven quantum phase transition in a two-molecule Kondo system,"<p>The magnetic properties of nanostructures that consist of a small number of atoms or molecules are typically determined by magnetic exchange interactions. Here, we show that non-magnetic, chemical interactions can have a similarly decisive effect if spin-moment-carrying orbitals extend in space and therefore allow the direct coupling of magnetic properties to wavefunction overlap and the formation of bonding and antibonding orbitals. We demonstrate this for a dimer of metal&#8211;molecule complexes on the Au(111) surface. A changing wavefunction overlap between the two monomers drives the surface-adsorbed dimer through a quantum phase transition from an underscreened triplet to a singlet ground state, with one configuration being located extremely close to a quantum critical point.</p>",[],False,"[""Taner Esat"", ""Benedikt Lechtenberg"", ""Thorsten Deilmann"", ""Christian Wagner"", ""Peter Kr\u00fcger"", ""Ruslan Temirov"", ""Michael Rohlfing"", ""Frithjof B.

article,Physical determinants of the self-replication of protein fibrils,"<p>The ability of biological molecules to replicate themselves is the foundation of life, requiring a complex cellular machinery. However, a range of aberrant processes involve the self-replication of pathological protein structures without any additional assistance. One example is the autocatalytic generation of pathological protein aggregates, including amyloid fibrils, involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we use computer simulations to identify the necessary requirements for the self-replication of fibrillar assemblies of proteins. We establish that a key physical determinant for this process is the affinity of proteins for the surfaces of fibrils. We find that self-replication can take place only in a very narrow regime of inter-protein interactions, implying a high level of sensitivity to system parameters and experimental conditions. We then compare our theoretical predictions with kinetic and biosensor measurements of fibrils formed from the A&#946; peptide associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Our results show a quantitative connection between the kinetics of self-replication and the surface coverage of fibrils by monomeric proteins. These findings reveal the fundamental physical requirements for the formation of supra-molecular structures able to replicate themselves, and shed light on mechanisms in play in the proliferation of protein aggregates in nature.</p>",[],False,"[""An\u0111ela \u0160ari\u0107"", ""Alexander K.

article,Collective stochastic coherence in recurrent neuronal networks,"<p>Recurrent networks of dynamic elements frequently exhibit emergent collective oscillations, which can show substantial regularity even when the individual elements are considerably noisy. How noise-induced dynamics at the local level coexists with regular oscillations at the global level is still unclear. Here we show that a combination of stochastic recurrence-based initiation with deterministic refractoriness in an excitable network can reconcile these two features, leading to maximum collective coherence for an intermediate noise level. We report this behaviour in the slow oscillation regime exhibited by a cerebral cortex network under dynamical conditions resembling slow-wave sleep and anaesthesia. Computational analysis of a biologically realistic network model reveals that an intermediate level of background noise leads to quasi-regular dynamics. We verify this prediction experimentally in cortical slices subject to varying amounts of extracellular potassium, which modulates neuronal excitability and thus synaptic noise. The model also predicts that this effectively regular state should exhibit noise-induced memory of the spatial propagation profile of the collective oscillations, which is also verified experimentally. Taken together, these results allow us to construe the high regularity observed experimentally in the brain as an instance of collective stochastic coherence.</p>",[],False,"[""Bel\u00e9n Sancrist\u00f3bal"", ""Beatriz Rebollo"", ""Pol Boada"", ""Maria V.
