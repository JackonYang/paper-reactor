article,Holographic maps of quasiparticle interference,"<p>The analysis of Fourier-transformed scanning tunnelling microscopy images with subatomic resolution is a common tool for studying the properties of quasiparticle excitations in strongly correlated materials. Although Fourier amplitudes are generally complex valued, earlier analysis primarily focused on their absolute values. Their complex phases were often deemed random, and thus irrelevant, due to the unknown positions of the impurities in the sample. Here we show how to factor out these random phases by analysing overlaps between Fourier amplitudes that differ by reciprocal lattice vectors. The resulting holographic maps provide important and previously unknown information about the electronic structures. When applied to superconducting cuprates, our method solves a long-standing puzzle of the dichotomy between equivalent wavevectors. We show that d-wave Wannier functions of the conduction band provide a natural explanation for experimental results that were interpreted as evidence for competing unconventional charge modulations. Our work opens a new pathway to identify the nature of electronic states in scanning tunnelling microscopy.</p>",[],False,"[""Emanuele G.

article,Supercurrent in a room-temperature Bose–Einstein magnon condensate,"<p>A supercurrent is a macroscopic effect of a phase-induced collective motion of a quantum condensate. So far, experimentally observed supercurrent phenomena such as superconductivity and superfluidity have been restricted to cryogenic temperatures. Here, we report on the discovery of a supercurrent in a Bose&#8211;Einstein magnon condensate prepared in a room-temperature ferrimagnetic film. The magnon condensate is formed in a parametrically pumped magnon gas and is subject to a thermal gradient created by local laser heating of the film. The appearance of the supercurrent, which is driven by a thermally induced phase shift in the condensate wavefunction, is evidenced by analysis of the temporal evolution of the magnon density measured by means of Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. Our findings offer opportunities for the investigation of room-temperature macroscopic quantum phenomena and their potential applications at ambient conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Dmytro A.

article,Emergent high-Tc ferroelectric ordering of strongly correlated and frustrated protons in a heteroepitaxial ice film,"<p>Materials containing strong correlation and frustration have the potential to respond to external perturbations in an unusual way. In the case of common water ice, protons in the hydrogen-bond network are strongly correlated and highly frustrated under Pauling&#8217;s ice rules. At low temperature, the strongly correlated protons lose ergodicity, and little is understood about the cooperative thermodynamic and electric response to external stimuli. Here, using a model platinum substrate, we demonstrate emergent high-T<sub>c</sub> ferroelectric proton ordering in a heteroepitaxial ice film. Such proton ordering is thermodynamically stable and has an extremely high critical temperature of &#8764;175&#8201;K. We found that anisotropy and protolysis driven by the electrostatistics at the heterointerface are key factors in stimulating this novel exotic ordering in the many-body correlated proton system. The significant increase in T<sub>c</sub> due to the heterointerface suggests the ubiquity of ferroelectric ice in nature&#8212;specifically, in space and the polar&#160;stratosphere.</p>",[],False,"[""Toshiki Sugimoto"", ""Norihiro Aiga"", ""Yuji Otsuki"", ""Kazuya Watanabe"", ""Yoshiyasu Matsumoto""]","Sugimoto, T., Aiga, N., Otsuki, Y. et al.

article,Klein tunnelling and electron trapping in nanometre-scale graphene quantum dots,"<p>Relativistic fermions that are incident on a high potential barrier can pass through unimpeded, a striking phenomenon termed the &#8216;Klein paradox&#8217; in quantum electrodynamics. Electrostatic potential barriers in graphene provide a solid-state analogue to realize this phenomenon. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to directly probe the transmission of electrons through sharp circular potential wells in graphene created by substrate engineering. We find that electrons in this geometry display quasi-bound states where the electron is trapped for a finite time before escaping via Klein tunnelling. We show that the continuum Dirac equation can be successfully used to model the energies and wavefunctions of these quasi-bound states down to atomic dimensions. We demonstrate that by tuning the geometry of the barrier it is possible to trap particular energies and angular momentum states with increased efficiency, showing that atomic-scale electrostatic potentials can be used to engineer quantum transport through graphene.</p>",[],False,"[""Christopher Guti\u00e9rrez"", ""Lola Brown"", ""Cheol-Joo Kim"", ""Jiwoong Park"", ""Abhay N.

article,Hidden geometric correlations in real multiplex networks,"<p>Real networks often form interacting parts of larger and more complex systems. Examples can be found in different domains, ranging from the Internet to structural and functional brain networks. Here, we show that these multiplex systems are not random combinations of single network layers. Instead, they are organized in specific ways dictated by hidden geometric correlations between the layers. We find that these correlations are significant in different real multiplexes, and form a key framework for answering many important questions. Specifically, we show that these geometric correlations facilitate the definition and detection of multidimensional communities, which are sets of nodes that are simultaneously similar in multiple layers. They also enable accurate trans-layer link prediction, meaning that connections in one layer can be predicted by observing the hidden geometric space of another layer. And they allow efficient targeted navigation in the multilayer system using only local knowledge, outperforming navigation in the single layers only if the geometric correlations are sufficiently&#160;strong.</p>",[],False,"[""Kaj-Kolja Kleineberg"", ""Mari\u00e1n Bogu\u00f1\u00e1"", ""M. \u00c1ngeles Serrano"", ""Fragkiskos Papadopoulos""]","Kleineberg, KK., Boguñá, M., Ángeles Serrano, M. et al.
