article,Anti-parity–time symmetry with flying atoms,"<p>The recently developed notion of parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry in optical systems has spawned intriguing prospects. So far, most experimental implementations have been reported in solid-state systems. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of optical anti-PT symmetry&#8212;the counterpart of conventional PT symmetry&#8212;in a warm atomic-vapour cell. Rapid coherence transport via flying atoms leads to a dissipative coupling between two long-lived atomic spin waves, allowing for the observation of the essential features of anti-PT symmetry with unprecedented precision on the phase-transition threshold, as well as refractionless light propagation. Moreover, we show that a linear or nonlinear interaction between the two spatially separated beams can be achieved. Our results advance non-Hermitian physics by bridging to the field of atomic, molecular and optical physics, where new phenomena and applications in quantum and nonlinear optics aided by (anti-)PT symmetry could be anticipated.</p>",[],False,"[""Peng Peng"", ""Wanxia Cao"", ""Ce Shen"", ""Weizhi Qu"", ""Jianming Wen"", ""Liang Jiang"", ""Yanhong Xiao""]","Peng, P., Cao, W., Shen, C. et al.

article,Deterministic patterns in cell motility,"<p>Cell migration paths are generally described as random walks, associated with both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. However, complex cell locomotion is not merely related to such fluctuations, but is often determined by the underlying machinery. Cell motility is driven mechanically by actin and myosin, two molecular components that generate contractile forces. Other cell functions make use of the same components and, therefore, will compete with the migratory apparatus. Here, we propose a physical model of such a competitive system, namely dendritic cells whose antigen capture function and migratory ability are coupled by myosin II. The model predicts that this coupling gives rise to a dynamic instability, whereby cells switch from persistent migration to unidirectional self-oscillation, through a Hopf bifurcation. Cells can then switch to periodic polarity reversals through a homoclinic bifurcation. These predicted dynamic regimes are characterized by robust features that we identify through in vitro trajectories of dendritic cells over long timescales and distances. We expect that competition for limited resources in other migrating cell types can lead to similar deterministic migration modes.</p>",[],False,"[""Ido Lavi"", ""Matthieu Piel"", ""Ana-Maria Lennon-Dum\u00e9nil"", ""Rapha\u00ebl Voituriez"", ""Nir S.

article,Local equilibrium in bird flocks,"<p>The correlated motion of flocks is an example of global order emerging from local interactions. An essential difference with respect to analogous ferromagnetic systems is that flocks are active: animals move relative to each other, dynamically rearranging their interaction network. This non-equilibrium characteristic has been studied theoretically, but its impact on actual animal groups remains to be fully explored experimentally. Here, we introduce a novel dynamical inference technique, based on the principle of maximum entropy, which accommodates network rearrangements and overcomes the problem of slow experimental sampling rates. We use this method to infer the strength and range of alignment forces from data of starling flocks. We find that local bird alignment occurs on a much faster timescale than neighbour rearrangement. Accordingly, equilibrium inference, which assumes a fixed interaction network, gives results consistent with dynamical inference. We conclude that bird orientations are in a state of local quasi-equilibrium over the interaction length scale, providing firm ground for the applicability of statistical physics in certain active&#160;systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Thierry Mora"", ""Aleksandra M.

article,Magnetotail energy dissipation during an auroral substorm,"<p>Violent releases of space plasma energy from the Earth&#8217;s magnetotail during substorms produce strong electric currents and bright aurora. But what modulates these currents and aurora and controls dissipation of the energy released in the ionosphere? Using data from the THEMIS fleet of satellites and ground-based imagers and magnetometers, we show that plasma energy dissipation is controlled by field-aligned currents (FACs) produced and modulated during magnetotail topology change and oscillatory braking of fast plasma jets at 10&#8211;14 Earth radii in the nightside magnetosphere. FACs appear in regions where plasma sheet pressure and flux tube volume gradients are non-collinear. Faster tailward expansion of magnetotail dipolarization and subsequent slower inner plasma sheet restretching during substorm expansion and recovery phases cause faster poleward then slower equatorward movement of the substorm aurora. Anharmonic radial plasma oscillations build up displaced current filaments and are responsible for discrete longitudinal auroral arcs that move equatorward at a velocity of about 1&#8201;km&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. This observed auroral activity appears sufficient to dissipate the released energy.</p>",[],False,"[""E. V. Panov"", ""W. Baumjohann"", ""R. A. Wolf"", ""R. Nakamura"", ""V. Angelopoulos"", ""J. M.

article,Cross-scale energy transport in space plasmas,"<p>The solar wind is a supersonic magnetized plasma streaming far into the heliosphere. Although cooling as it flows, it is rapidly heated upon encountering planetary obstacles. At Earth, this interaction forms the magnetosphere and its sub-regions. The present paper focuses on particle heating across the boundary separating the shocked solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, which is driven by mechanisms operating on fluid, ion and electron scales. The cross-scale energy transport between these scales is a compelling and fundamental problem of plasma physics. Here, we present evidence of the energy transport between fluid and ion scales: free energy is provided in terms of a velocity shear generating fluid-scale Kelvin&#8211;Helmholtz instability. We show the unambiguous observation of an ion-scale magnetosonic wave packet, inside a Kelvin&#8211;Helmholtz vortex, with sufficient energy to account for observed ion heating. The present finding has universal consequences in understanding cross-scale energy transport, applicable to environments experiencing velocity shears during comparable plasma regimes.</p>",[],False,"[""T.

Our map exhibits a strong central concentration of BHB stars with ages greater than 12&#8201;Gyr, extending up to &#8764;15&#8201;kpc from the Galactic Centre (reaching close to the solar vicinity), and a decrease in the mean ages of field stars with distance by 1&#8211;1.5&#8201;Gyr out to &#8764;45&#8211;50&#8201;kpc, along with an apparent increase of the dispersion of stellar ages, and numerous known (and previously unknown) resolved over-densities and debris streams, including the Sagittarius Stream.
