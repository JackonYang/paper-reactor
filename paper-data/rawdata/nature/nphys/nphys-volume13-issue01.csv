article,Dynamical observations of self-stabilizing stationary light,"<p>The precise control of atom&#8211;light interactions is vital to many quantum technologies. For instance, atomic systems can be used to slow and store light, acting as a quantum memory. Optical storage can be achieved via stopped light, where no optical energy continues to exist in the atomic system, or as stationary light, where some optical energy remains present during storage. Here, we demonstrate a form of self-stabilizing stationary light. From any initial state, our atom&#8211;light system evolves to a stable configuration that may contain bright optical excitations trapped within the atomic ensemble. This phenomenon is verified experimentally in a cloud of cold Rb<sup>87</sup> atoms. The spinwave in our atomic cloud is imaged from the side, allowing direct comparison with theoretical predictions.</p>",[],False,"[""J.\u00a0L. Everett"", ""G. T. Campbell"", ""Y.-W. Cho"", ""P.

article,Superfluid Brillouin optomechanics,"<p>Optomechanical systems couple an electromagnetic cavity to a mechanical resonator which typically is a solid object. The range of phenomena accessible in these systems depends on the properties of the mechanical resonator and on the manner in which it couples to the cavity fields. In both respects, a mechanical resonator formed from superfluid liquid helium offers several appealing features: low electromagnetic absorption, high thermal conductivity, vanishing viscosity, well-understood mechanical loss, and in&#160;situ alignment with cryogenic cavities. In addition, it offers degrees of freedom that differ qualitatively from those of a solid. Here, we describe an optomechanical system consisting of a miniature optical cavity filled with superfluid helium. The cavity mirrors define optical and mechanical modes with near-perfect overlap, resulting in an optomechanical coupling rate &#8764;3&#8201;kHz. This coupling is used to drive the superfluid and is also used to observe the thermal motion of the superfluid, resolving a mean phonon number as low as eleven.</p>",[],False,"[""A. D.

However, the spontaneous formation of spatial patterns amidst insulator&#8211;metal phase coexistence remains poorly explored on the meso- and nanoscales. Here we present real-space evolution of the insulator&#8211;metal transition in a V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin film imaged at high spatial resolution by cryogenic near-field infrared microscopy. We resolve spontaneously nanotextured coexistence of metal and correlated Mott insulator phases near the insulator&#8211;metal transition (&#8764;160&#8211;180&#8201;K) associated with percolation and an underlying structural phase transition. Augmented with macroscopic temperature-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements of the same film, a quantitative analysis of nano-infrared images acquired across the transition suggests decoupling of electronic and structural transformations.

article,Controlled finite momentum pairing and spatially varying order parameter in proximitized HgTe quantum wells,"<p>Conventional s-wave superconductivity arises from singlet pairing of electrons with opposite Fermi momenta, forming Cooper pairs with zero net momentum. Recent studies have focused on coupling s-wave superconductors to systems with an unusual configuration of electronic spin and momentum at the Fermi surface, where the nature of the paired state can be modified and the system may even undergo a topological phase transition. Here we present measurements and theoretical calculations of HgTe quantum wells coupled to aluminium or niobium superconductors and subject to a magnetic field in the plane of the quantum well. We find that this magnetic field tunes the momentum of Cooper pairs in the quantum well, directly reflecting the response of the spin-dependent Fermi surfaces. In the high electron density regime, the induced superconductivity evolves with electron density in agreement with our model based on the Hamiltonian of Bernevig, Hughes and Zhang. This agreement provides a quantitative value for g &#771;/v<sub>F</sub>, where g &#771; is the effective g-factor and v<sub>F</sub> is the Fermi velocity. Our new understanding of the interplay between spin physics and superconductivity introduces a way to spatially engineer the order parameter from singlet to triplet pairing, and in general allows investigation of electronic spin texture at the Fermi surface of materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Sean Hart"", ""Hechen Ren"", ""Michael Kosowsky"", ""Gilad Ben-Shach"", ""Philipp Leubner"", ""Christoph Br\u00fcne"", ""Hartmut Buhmann"", ""Laurens W.

article,Universal dynamics and deterministic switching of dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators,"<p>Temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators enable the generation of ultrashort pulses and low-noise frequency combs at microwave repetition rates. They have been demonstrated in a growing number of microresonator platforms, enabling chip-scale frequency combs, optical synthesis of low-noise microwaves and multichannel coherent communications. In all these applications, accessing and maintaining a single-soliton state is a key requirement&#8212;one that remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we study the dynamics of multiple-soliton states and report the discovery of a simple mechanism that deterministically switches the soliton state by reducing the number of solitons one by one. We demonstrate this control in Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and MgF<sub>2</sub> resonators and, moreover, we observe a secondary peak to emerge in the response of the system to a pump modulation, an effect uniquely associated with the soliton regime. Exploiting this feature, we map the multi-stability diagram of a microresonator experimentally. Our measurements show the physical mechanism of the soliton switching and provide insight into soliton dynamics in microresonators. The technique provides a method to sequentially reduce, monitor and stabilize an arbitrary state with solitons, in particular allowing for feedback stabilization of single-soliton states, which is necessary for practical applications.</p>",[],False,"[""H.
