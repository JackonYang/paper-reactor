article,Chiral ground-state currents of interacting photons in a synthetic magnetic field,"<p>The intriguing many-body phases of quantum matter arise from the interplay of particle interactions, spatial symmetries, and external fields. Generating these phases in an engineered system could provide deeper insight into their nature. Using superconducting qubits, we simultaneously realize synthetic magnetic fields and strong particle interactions, which are among the essential elements for studying quantum magnetism and fractional quantum Hall phenomena. The artificial magnetic fields are synthesized by sinusoidally modulating the qubit couplings. In a closed loop formed by the three qubits, we observe the directional circulation of photons, a signature of broken time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate strong interactions through the creation of photon vacancies, or &#8216;holes&#8217;, which circulate in the opposite direction. The combination of these key elements results in chiral ground-state currents.

article,A proton density bubble in the doubly magic 34Si nucleus,"<p>Many properties of the atomic nucleus, such as vibrations, rotations and incompressibility, can be interpreted as due to a two-component quantum liquid of protons and neutrons. Electron scattering measurements on stable nuclei demonstrate that their central densities are saturated, as for liquid drops. In exotic nuclei near the limits of mass and charge, with large imbalances in their proton and neutron numbers, the possibility of a depleted central density, or a &#8216;bubble&#8217; structure, has been discussed in a recurrent manner since the 1970s. Here we report first experimental evidence that points to a depletion of the central density of protons in the short-lived nucleus <sup>34</sup>Si. The proton-to-neutron density asymmetry in <sup>34</sup>Si offers the possibility to place constraints on the density and isospin dependence of the spin&#8211;orbit force&#8212;on which nuclear models have disagreed for decades&#8212;and on its stabilizing effect towards limits of nuclear existence.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Spiral spin-liquid and the emergence of a vortex-like state in MnSc2S4,"<p>Spirals and helices are common motifs of long-range order in magnetic solids, and they may also be organized into more complex emergent structures such as magnetic skyrmions and vortices. A new type of spiral state, the spiral spin-liquid, in which spins fluctuate collectively as spirals, has recently been predicted to exist. Here, using neutron scattering techniques, we experimentally prove the existence of a spiral spin-liquid in MnSc<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> by directly observing the &#8216;spiral surface&#8217;&#8212;a continuous surface of spiral propagation vectors in reciprocal space. We elucidate the multi-step ordering behaviour of the spiral spin-liquid, and discover a vortex-like triple-q phase on application of a magnetic field. Our results prove the effectiveness of the J<sub>1</sub>&#8211;J<sub>2</sub> Hamiltonian on the diamond lattice as a model for the spiral spin-liquid state in MnSc<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, and also demonstrate a new way to realize a magnetic vortex lattice through frustrated interactions.</p>",[],False,"[""Shang Gao"", ""Oksana Zaharko"", ""Vladimir Tsurkan"", ""Yixi Su"", ""Jonathan S.

article,Direct observation of the skyrmion Hall effect,"<p>The well-known Hall effect describes the transverse deflection of charged particles (electrons/holes) as a result of the Lorentz force. Similarly, it is intriguing to examine if quasi-particles without an electric charge, but with a topological charge, show related transverse motion. Magnetic skyrmions with a well-defined spin texture with a unit topological charge serve as good candidates to test this hypothesis. In spite of the recent progress made on investigating magnetic skyrmions, direct observation of the skyrmion Hall effect has remained elusive. Here, by using a current-induced spin Hall spin torque, we experimentally demonstrate the skyrmion Hall effect, and the resultant skyrmion accumulation, by driving skyrmions from the creep-motion regime (where their dynamics are influenced by pinning defects) into the steady-flow-motion regime. The experimental observation of transverse transport of skyrmions due to topological charge may potentially create many exciting opportunities, such as topological selection.</p>",[],False,"[""Wanjun Jiang"", ""Xichao Zhang"", ""Guoqiang Yu"", ""Wei Zhang"", ""Xiao Wang"", ""M.

article,Skyrmion Hall effect revealed by direct time-resolved X-ray microscopy,"<p>Magnetic skyrmions are promising candidates for future spintronic applications such as skyrmion racetrack memories and logic devices. They exhibit exotic and complex dynamics governed by topology and are less influenced by defects, such as edge roughness, than conventionally used domain walls. In particular, their non-zero topological charge leads to a predicted &#8216;skyrmion Hall effect&#8217;, in which current-driven skyrmions acquire a transverse velocity component analogous to charged particles in the conventional Hall effect. Here, we use nanoscale pump&#8211;probe imaging to reveal the real-time dynamics of skyrmions driven by current-induced spin&#8211;orbit torques. We find that skyrmions move at a well-defined angle &#920;<sub>SkH</sub> that can exceed 30&#176; with respect to the current flow, but in contrast to conventional theoretical expectations, &#920;<sub>SkH</sub> increases linearly with velocity up to at least 100&#8201;ms<sup>&#8722;1</sup>.

article,Strongly exchange-coupled triplet pairs in an organic semiconductor,"<p>From biological complexes to devices based on organic semiconductors, spin interactions play a key role in the function of molecular systems. For instance, triplet-pair reactions impact operation of organic light-emitting diodes as well as photovoltaic devices. Conventional models for triplet pairs assume they interact only weakly. Here, using electron spin resonance, we observe long-lived, strongly interacting triplet pairs in an organic semiconductor, generated via singlet fission. Using coherent spin manipulation of these two-triplet states, we identify exchange-coupled (spin-2) quintet complexes coexisting with weakly coupled (spin-1) triplets. We measure strongly coupled pairs with a lifetime approaching 3&#8201;&#956;s and a spin coherence time approaching 1&#8201;&#956;s, at 10&#8201;K.

article,Quintet multiexciton dynamics in singlet fission,"<p>Singlet fission, in which two triplet excitons are generated from a single absorbed photon, is a key third-generation solar cell concept. Conservation of angular momentum requires that singlet fission populates correlated multiexciton states, which can subsequently dissociate to generate free triplets. However, little is known about electronic and spin correlations in these systems since, due to its typically short lifetime, the multiexciton state is challenging to isolate and study. Here, we use bridged pentacene dimers, which undergo intramolecular singlet fission while isolated in solution and in solid matrices, as a unimolecular model system that can trap long-lived multiexciton states. We combine transient absorption and time-resolved electron spin resonance spectroscopies to show that spin correlations in the multiexciton state persist for hundreds of nanoseconds. Furthermore, we confirm long-standing predictions that singlet fission produces triplet pair states of quintet character. We compare two different pentacene&#8211;bridge&#8211;pentacene chromophores, systematically tuning the coupling between the pentacenes to understand how differences in molecular structure affect the population and dissociation of multiexciton quintet states.</p>",[],False,"[""Murad J.

article,Electric-field-induced spin disorder-to-order transition near a multiferroic triple phase point,"<p>The emergence of a triple phase point in a two-dimensional parameter space (such as pressure and temperature) can offer unforeseen opportunities for the coupling of two seemingly independent order parameters. On the basis of this, we demonstrate the electric control of magnetic order by manipulating chemical pressure: lanthanum substitution in the antiferromagnetic ferroelectric BiFeO<sub>3</sub>. Our demonstration relies on the finding that a multiferroic triple phase point of a single spin-disordered phase and two spin-ordered phases emerges near room temperature in Bi<sub>0.9</sub>La<sub>0.1</sub>FeO<sub>3</sub> ferroelectric thin films.
