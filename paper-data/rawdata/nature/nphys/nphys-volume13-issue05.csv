article,Periodically driving a many-body localized quantum system,"<p>Periodically driven quantum many-body systems can display rich dynamics and host exotic phases that are absent in their undriven counterparts. However, in the presence of interactions such systems are expected to eventually heat up to a simple infinite-temperature state. One possible exception is a periodically driven many-body localized system, in which heating is precluded by strong disorder. Here, we use a gas of ultracold fermionic potassium atoms in optical lattices to prepare and probe such a driven system and show that it is indeed stable for high enough driving frequency. Moreover, we find a novel regime in which the system is exceedingly stable even at low drive frequencies, a particular feature of our driving scheme. Our experimental findings are well supported by numerical simulations and may provide avenues for engineering novel phases in periodically driven matter.</p>",[],False,"[""Pranjal Bordia"", ""Henrik L\u00fcschen"", ""Ulrich Schneider"", ""Michael Knap"", ""Immanuel Bloch""]","Bordia, P., Lüschen, H., Schneider, U. et al.

article,Generalized non-reciprocity in an optomechanical circuit via synthetic magnetism and reservoir engineering,"<p>Synthetic magnetism has been used to control charge neutral excitations for applications ranging from classical beam steering to quantum simulation. In optomechanics, radiation-pressure-induced parametric coupling between optical (photon) and mechanical (phonon) excitations may be used to break time-reversal symmetry, providing the prerequisite for synthetic magnetism. Here we design and fabricate a silicon optomechanical circuit with both optical and mechanical connectivity between two optomechanical cavities. Driving the two cavities with phase-correlated laser light results in a synthetic magnetic flux, which, in combination with dissipative coupling to the mechanical bath, leads to non-reciprocal transport of photons with 35&#8201;dB of isolation. Additionally, optical pumping with blue-detuned light manifests as a particle non-conserving interaction between photons and phonons, resulting in directional optical amplification of 12&#8201;dB in the isolator through-direction. These results suggest the possibility of using optomechanical circuits to create a more general class of non-reciprocal optical devices, and further, to enable new topological phases for both light and sound on a microchip.</p>",[],False,"[""Kejie Fang"", ""Jie Luo"", ""Anja Metelmann"", ""Matthew H.

article,State-resolved attosecond reversible and irreversible dynamics in strong optical fields,"<p>Strong-field ionization (SFI) is a key process for accessing real-time quantum dynamics of electrons on the attosecond timescale. The theoretical foundation of SFI was pioneered in the 1960s, and later refined by various analytical models. While asymptotic ionization rates predicted by these models have been tested to be in reasonable agreement for a wide range of laser parameters, predictions for SFI on the sub-laser-cycle timescale are either beyond the scope of the models or show strong qualitative deviations from full quantum-mechanical simulations. Here, using the unprecedented state specificity of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we follow the real-time SFI process of the two valence spin&#8211;orbit states of xenon. The results reveal that the irreversible tunnelling contribution is accompanied by a reversible electronic population that exhibits an observable spin&#8211;orbit-dependent phase delay. A detailed theoretical analysis attributes this observation to transient ground-state polarization, an unexpected facet of SFI that cannot be captured by existing analytical models that focus exclusively on the production of asymptotic electron/ion yields.</p>",[],False,"[""Mazyar Sabbar"", ""Henry Timmers"", ""Yi-Jen Chen"", ""Allison K.

article,Transient superconductivity from electronic squeezing of optically pumped phonons,"<p>Advances in light sources and time-resolved spectroscopy have made it possible to excite specific atomic vibrations in solids and to observe the resulting changes in electronic properties, but the mechanism by which phonon excitation causes qualitative changes in electronic properties has remained unclear. Here we show that the dominant symmetry-allowed coupling between electron density and dipole active modes implies an electron-density-dependent squeezing of the phonon state that provides an attractive contribution to the electron&#8211;electron interaction, independent of the sign of the bare electron&#8211;phonon coupling and with a magnitude proportional to the degree of laser-induced phonon excitation. Reasonable excitation amplitudes lead to non-negligible attractive interactions that may cause significant transient changes in electronic properties, including superconductivity. The mechanism is generically applicable to a wide range of systems, offering a promising route to manipulating and controlling electronic phase behaviour in novel materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Dante M.

article,Emergent Dirac fermions and broken symmetries in confined and deconfined phases of Z2 gauge theories,"<p>Lattice gauge theories are used to describe a wide range of phenomena from quark confinement to quantum materials. At finite fermion density, gauge theories are notoriously hard to analyse due to the fermion sign problem. Here, we investigate the Ising gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions, a problem of great interest in condensed matter, and show that it is free of the sign problem at arbitrary fermion density. At generic filling, we find that gauge fluctuations mediate pairing, leading to a transition between a deconfined BCS state and a confined BEC. At half-filling, a &#960;-flux phase is generated spontaneously with emergent Dirac fermions. The deconfined Dirac phase, with a vanishing Fermi surface volume, is a non-trivial example of violation of Luttinger&#8217;s theorem due to fractionalization. At strong coupling, we find a single continuous transition between the deconfined Dirac phase and the confined BEC, in contrast to the expected split transition.</p>",[],False,"[""Snir Gazit"", ""Mohit Randeria"", ""Ashvin Vishwanath""]","Gazit, S., Randeria, M. & Vishwanath, A.

article,Edge reconstruction in fractional quantum Hall states,"<p>The nature of edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) and the issue of where the current flows have been debated for years. Moreover, the recent observation of proliferation of &#8216;upstream&#8217; neutral modes in the fractional QHE has raised doubts about the present models of edge channels. Here, we present a new picture of the edge reconstruction in two of the hole-conjugate states. For example, while the present model for &#957; = (2/3) consists of a single downstream chiral charge channel with conductance (2/3)(e<sup>2</sup>/h) and an upstream neutral mode, we show that the current is carried by two separate downstream chiral edge channels, each with conductance (1/3)(e<sup>2</sup>/h). We uncover a novel mechanism of fragmentation of upstream neutral modes into downstream propagating charge modes that induces current fluctuations with zero net current. Our unexpected results underline the need for better understanding of edge reconstruction and energy transport in all fractional QHE states.</p>",[],False,"[""Ron Sabo"", ""Itamar Gurman"", ""Amir Rosenblatt"", ""Fabien Lafont"", ""Daniel Banitt"", ""Jinhong Park"", ""Moty Heiblum"", ""Yuval Gefen"", ""Vladimir Umansky"", ""Diana Mahalu""]","Sabo, R., Gurman, I., Rosenblatt, A. et al.

article,Correlation-enhanced control of wave focusing in disordered media,"<p>A fundamental challenge in physics is controlling the propagation of waves in disordered media despite strong scattering from inhomogeneities. Spatial light modulators enable one to synthesize (shape) the incident wavefront, optimizing the multipath interference to achieve a specific behaviour such as focusing light to a target region. However, the extent of achievable control is not known when the target region is much larger than the wavelength and contains many speckles. Here we show that for targets containing more than g speckles, where g is the dimensionless conductance, the extent of transmission control is substantially enhanced by the long-range mesoscopic correlations among the speckles. Using a filtered random matrix ensemble appropriate for coherent diffusion in open geometries, we predict the full distributions of transmission eigenvalues as well as universal scaling laws for statistical properties, in excellent agreement with our experiment.

article,Surface-assisted single-crystal formation of charged colloids,"<p>Substrate-induced heterogeneous nucleation is a promising way to form an extended single crystal with few defects while controlling its direction. Despite its technological importance, however, the physics behind this process has remained elusive. By studying the kinetic pathway of crystal nucleation and growth at a single-particle level both experimentally and numerically, we reveal that the keys to substrate-induced monomorphic single-crystal formation are matching of the angular symmetry between locally favoured structures formed in a supercooled liquid and the most stable crystal and non-trivial coupling of the former to substrate-induced layering in the liquid. These two conditions are crucial for direct formation of the most stable crystal while keeping its unique direction relative to the substrate. We also discuss special features of charged systems. Our finding indicates that pre-ordering in a supercooled liquid state under the influence of a substrate largely dominates the course of future crystallization, providing new insights into the control of heterogeneous crystallization.</p>",[],False,"[""Shunto Arai"", ""Hajime Tanaka""]","Arai, S., Tanaka, H.

article,Confined dense circumstellar material surrounding a regular type II supernova,"<p>With the advent of new wide-field, high-cadence optical transient surveys, our understanding of the diversity of core-collapse supernovae has grown tremendously in the last decade. However, the pre-supernova evolution of massive stars, which sets the physical backdrop to these violent events, is theoretically not well understood and difficult to probe observationally. Here we report the discovery of the supernova iPTF&#8201;13dqy = SN&#8201;2013fs a mere &#8764;3&#8201;h after explosion. Our rapid follow-up observations, which include multiwavelength photometry and extremely early (beginning at &#8764;6&#8201;h post-explosion) spectra, map the distribution of material in the immediate environment (&#8818;10<sup>15</sup>&#8201;cm) of the exploding star and establish that it was surrounded by circumstellar material (CSM) that was ejected during the final &#8764;1&#8201;yr prior to explosion at a high rate, around 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup> solar masses per year. The complete disappearance of flash-ionized emission lines within the first several days requires that the dense CSM be confined to within &#8818;10<sup>15</sup>&#8201;cm, consistent with radio non-detections at 70&#8211;100&#8201;days. The observations indicate that iPTF&#8201;13dqy&#160;was a regular type II supernova; thus, the finding that the probable red supergiant progenitor of this common explosion ejected material at a highly elevated rate just prior to its demise suggests that pre-supernova instabilities may be common among exploding massive stars.</p>",[],False,"[""O.
