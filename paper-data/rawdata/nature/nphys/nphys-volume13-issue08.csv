article,Proposal for gravitational-wave detection beyond the standard quantum limit through EPR entanglement,"<p>In continuously monitored systems the standard quantum limit is given by the trade-off between shot noise and back-action noise. In gravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, both contributions can be simultaneously squeezed in a broad frequency band by injecting a spectrum of squeezed vacuum states with a frequency-dependent squeeze angle. This approach requires setting up an additional long baseline, low-loss filter cavity in a vacuum system at the detector&#8217;s site. Here, we show that the need for such a filter cavity can be eliminated, by exploiting Einstein&#8211;Podolsky&#8211;Rosen (EPR)-entangled signals and idler beams. By harnessing their mutual quantum correlations and the difference in the way each beam propagates in the interferometer, we can engineer the input signal beam to have the appropriate frequency-dependent conditional squeezing once the out-going idler beam is detected. Our proposal is appropriate for all future gravitational-wave detectors for achieving sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit.</p>",[],False,"[""Yiqiu Ma"", ""Haixing Miao"", ""Belinda Heyun Pang"", ""Matthew Evans"", ""Chunnong Zhao"", ""Jan Harms"", ""Roman Schnabel"", ""Yanbei Chen""]","Ma, Y., Miao, H., Pang, B. et al.

article,Measuring out-of-time-order correlations and multiple quantum spectra in a trapped-ion quantum magnet,"<p>Controllable arrays of ions and ultracold atoms can simulate complex many-body phenomena and may provide insights into unsolved problems in modern science. To this end, experimentally feasible protocols for quantifying the buildup of quantum correlations and coherence are needed, as performing full state tomography does not scale favourably with the number of particles. Here we develop and experimentally demonstrate such a protocol, which uses time reversal of the many-body dynamics to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) in a long-range Ising spin quantum simulator with more than 100 ions in a Penning trap. By measuring a family of OTOCs as a function of a tunable parameter we obtain fine-grained information about the state of the system encoded in the multiple quantum coherence spectrum, extract the quantum state purity, and demonstrate the buildup of up to 8-body correlations. Future applications of this protocol could enable studies of many-body localization, quantum phase transitions, and tests of the holographic duality between quantum and gravitational&#160;systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Martin G\u00e4rttner"", ""Justin G.

article,A dissipative quantum reservoir for microwave light using a mechanical oscillator,"<p>Engineered dissipation can be used for quantum state preparation. This is achieved with a suitably engineered coupling to a dissipative cold reservoir usually formed by an electromagnetic mode. In the field of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the electromagnetic cavity naturally serves as a cold reservoir for the mechanical mode. Here, we realize the opposite scenario and engineer a mechanical oscillator cooled close to its ground state into a cold dissipative reservoir for microwave photons in a superconducting circuit. By tuning the coupling to this dissipative mechanical reservoir, we demonstrate dynamical backaction control of the microwave field, leading to stimulated emission and maser action. Moreover, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum resource, allowing the implementation of a near-quantum-limited phase-preserving microwave amplifier. Such engineered mechanical dissipation extends the toolbox of quantum manipulation techniques of the microwave field and constitutes a new ingredient for optomechanical protocols.</p>",[],False,"[""L.\u00a0D.

article,Möbius Kondo insulators,"<p>Heavy fermion materials have recently attracted attention for their potential to combine topological protection with strongly correlated electron physics. To date, the ideas of topological protection have been restricted to the heavy fermion or &#8216;Kondo&#8217; insulators with the simplest point-group symmetries. Here we argue that the presence of nonsymmorphic crystal symmetries in many heavy fermion materials opens up a new family of topologically protected heavy electron systems. Re-examination of archival resistivity measurements in the nonsymmorphic heavy fermion insulators Ce<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>4</sub>Pt<sub>3</sub> and CeNiSn reveals the presence of a low-temperature conductivity plateau, making them candidate members of the new class of material. We illustrate our ideas with a specific model for CeNiSn, showing how glide symmetries generate surface states with a novel M&#246;bius braiding that can be detected by ARPES or non-local conductivity measurements. One of the interesting effects of strong correlation is the development of partially localization or &#8216;Kondo breakdown&#8217; on the surfaces, which transforms M&#246;bius surface states into quasi-one-dimensional conductors, with the potential for novel electronic phase transitions.</p>",[],False,"[""Po-Yao Chang"", ""Onur Erten"", ""Piers Coleman""]","Chang, PY., Erten, O. & Coleman, P.

article,Quasiparticle interference and strong electron–mode coupling in the quasi-one-dimensional bands of Sr2RuO4,"<p>The single-layered ruthenate Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> is presented as a potential spin-triplet superconductor with an order parameter that may break time-reversal invariance and host half-quantized vortices with Majorana zero modes. Although the actual nature of the superconducting state is still a matter of controversy, it is believed to condense from a metallic state that is well described by a conventional Fermi liquid. In this work we use a combination of Fourier transform scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (FT-STS) and momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS) to probe interaction effects in the normal state of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>. Our high-resolution FT-STS data show signatures of the &#946;-band with a distinctly quasi-one-dimensional (1D) character. The band dispersion reveals surprisingly strong interaction effects that dramatically renormalize the Fermi velocity, suggesting that the normal state of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> is that of a &#8216;correlated metal&#8217; where correlations are strengthened by the quasi-1D nature of the bands. In addition, kinks at energies of approximately 10&#8201;meV, 38&#8201;meV and 70&#8201;meV are observed. By comparing STM and M-EELS data we show that the two higher energy features arise from coupling with collective modes.

article,Mottness at finite doping and charge instabilities in cuprates,"<p>The influence of Mott physics on the doping&#8211;temperature phase diagram of copper oxides represents a major issue that is the subject of intense theoretical and experimental efforts. Here, we investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics in prototypical single-layer Bi-based cuprates at the energy scale of the O-2p &#8594; Cu-3d charge-transfer (CT) process. We demonstrate a clear evolution of the CT excitations from incoherent and localized, as in a Mott insulator, to coherent and delocalized, as in a conventional metal. This reorganization of the high-energy degrees of freedom occurs at the critical doping p<sub>cr</sub> &#8776; 0.16 irrespective of the temperature, and it can be well described by dynamical mean-field theory calculations. We argue that the onset of low-temperature charge instabilities is the low-energy manifestation of the underlying Mottness that characterizes the p &lt; p<sub>cr</sub> region of the phase diagram.

article,Mixed electrochemical–ferroelectric states in nanoscale ferroelectrics,"<p>Ferroelectricity on the nanoscale has been the subject of much fascination in condensed-matter physics for over half a century. In recent years, multiple reports claiming ferroelectricity in ultrathin ferroelectric films based on the formation of remnant polarization states, local electromechanical hysteresis loops, and pressure-induced switching were made. However, similar phenomena were reported for traditionally non-ferroelectric materials, creating a significant level of uncertainty in the field. Here we show that in nanoscale systems the ferroelectric state is fundamentally inseparable from the electrochemical state of the surface, leading to the emergence of a mixed electrochemical&#8211;ferroelectric state. We explore the nature, thermodynamics, and thickness evolution of such states, and demonstrate the experimental pathway to establish its presence. This analysis reconciles multiple prior studies, provides guidelines for studies of ferroelectric materials on the nanoscale, and establishes the design paradigm for new generations of ferroelectric-based devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Sang Mo Yang"", ""Anna N.
