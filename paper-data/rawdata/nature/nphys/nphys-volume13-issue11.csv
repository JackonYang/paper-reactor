review article,The physics of quantum materials,"<p>The physical description of all materials is rooted in quantum mechanics, which describes how atoms bond and electrons interact at a fundamental level. Although these quantum effects can in many cases be approximated by a classical description at the macroscopic level, in recent years there has been growing interest in material systems where quantum effects remain manifest over a wider range of energy and length scales. Such quantum materials include superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, Weyl semimetals, quantum spin liquids, and spin ices. Many of them derive their properties from reduced dimensionality, in particular from confinement of electrons to two-dimensional sheets. Moreover, they tend to be materials in which electrons cannot be considered as independent particles but interact strongly and give rise to collective excitations known as quasiparticles. In all cases, however, quantum-mechanical effects fundamentally alter properties of the material. This Review surveys the electronic properties of quantum materials through the prism of the electron wavefunction, and examines how its entanglement and topology give rise to a rich variety of quantum states and phases; these are less classically describable than conventional ordered states also driven by quantum mechanics, such as ferromagnetism.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

review article,Emergent functions of quantum materials,"<p>Materials can harbour quantum many-body systems, most typically in the form of strongly correlated electrons in solids, that lead to novel and remarkable functions thanks to emergence&#8212;collective behaviours that arise from strong interactions among the elements. These include the Mott transition, high-temperature superconductivity, topological superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, giant magnetoelectric effect, and topological insulators. These phenomena will probably be crucial for developing the next-generation quantum technologies that will meet the urgent technological demands for achieving a sustainable and safe society. Dissipationless electronics using topological currents and quantum spins, energy harvesting such as photovoltaics and thermoelectrics, and secure quantum computing and communication are the three major fields of applications working towards this goal. Here, we review the basic principles and the current status of the emergent phenomena and functions in materials from the viewpoint of strong correlation and topology.</p>",[],False,"[""Yoshinori Tokura"", ""Masashi Kawasaki"", ""Naoto Nagaosa""]","Tokura, Y., Kawasaki, M. & Nagaosa, N.

article,Observation of topological edge states in parity–time-symmetric quantum walks,"<p>The study of non-Hermitian systems with parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry is a rapidly developing frontier. Realized in recent experiments, PT-symmetric classical optical systems with balanced gain and loss hold great promise for future applications. Here we report the experimental realization of passive PT-symmetric quantum dynamics for single photons by temporally alternating photon losses in the quantum walk interferometers. The ability to impose PT symmetry allows us to realize and investigate Floquet topological phases driven by PT-symmetric quantum walks. We observe topological edge states between regions with different bulk topological properties and confirm the robustness of these edge states with respect to PT-symmetry-preserving perturbations and PT-symmetry-breaking static disorder. Our results contribute towards the realization of quantum mechanical PT-synthetic devices and suggest exciting possibilities for the exploration of the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems using discrete-time quantum walks.</p>",[],False,"[""L.

article,Negative permittivity in bubble and stripe phases,"<p>The physics of itinerant electrons in condensed matter is by and large governed by repulsive Coulomb forces. However, attractive interactions may emerge and prevail in determining the ground state despite the pervasive Coulomb repulsion. A notable example is electron pairing and superconductivity. The interplay of attractive and repulsive interactions may also instigate spontaneous symmetry lowering and clustering of charges in geometric patterns even without net attraction. Both types of attractive interaction triggered physics&#8212;pairing and charge ordering&#8212;are at play in two-dimensional electron systems exposed to a quantizing magnetic field. The charge ordering has been concluded indirectly from transport behaviour. Here we report the observation of negative permittivity present solely when bubble and stripe phases form. In conjunction with a theoretical model, the negative permittivity provides evidence for the underlying attractive exchange-correlation energy which sufficiently countervails Coulomb repulsion at small distances to enable and mediate charge clustering.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

Here we report on an almost ideal spin liquid state that appears to be realized by atomic-cluster spins on the triangular lattice of a charge-density wave state of 1T-TaS<sub>2</sub>. In this system, the charge excitations have a well-defined gap of &#8764;0.3&#8201;eV, while nuclear quadrupole resonance and muon-spin-relaxation experiments reveal that the spins show gapless QSL dynamics and no long-range magnetic order at least down to 70&#8201;mK. Canonical T<sup>2</sup> power-law temperature dependence of the spin relaxation dynamics characteristic of a QSL is observed from 200&#8201;K to T<sub>f</sub> = 55&#8201;K.

article,Forward and inverse kinetic energy cascades in Jupiter's turbulent weather layer,"<p>Jupiter&#8217;s turbulent weather layer contains phenomena of many different sizes, from local storms up to the Great Red Spot and banded jets. The global circulation is driven by complex interactions with (as yet uncertain) small-scale processes. We have calculated structure functions and kinetic energy spectral fluxes from Cassini observations over a wide range of length scales in Jupiter&#8217;s atmosphere. We found evidence for an inverse cascade of kinetic energy from length scales comparable to the first baroclinic Rossby deformation radius up to the global jet scale, but also a forward cascade of kinetic energy from the deformation radius to smaller scales. This second result disagrees with the traditional picture of Jupiter&#8217;s atmospheric dynamics, but has some similarities with mesoscale phenomena in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and oceans. We conclude that the inverse cascade driving Jupiter&#8217;s jets may have a dominant energy source at scales close to the deformation radius, such as baroclinic instability.</p>",[],False,"[""Roland M.
