article,Coherence time of over a second in a telecom-compatible quantum memory storage material,"<p>Quantum memories for light will be essential elements in future long-range quantum communication networks. These memories operate by reversibly mapping the quantum state of light onto the quantum transitions of a material system. For networks, the quantum coherence times of these transitions must be long compared to the network transmission times, approximately 100&#8201;ms for a global communication network. Due to a lack of a suitable storage material, a quantum memory that operates in the 1,550&#8201;nm optical fibre communication band with a storage time greater than 1&#8201;&#956;s has not been demonstrated. Here we describe the spin dynamics of <sup>167</sup>Er<sup>3+</sup>: Y<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub> in a high magnetic field and demonstrate that this material has the characteristics for a practical quantum memory in the 1,550&#8201;nm communication band.

article,Topological materials discovery using electron filling constraints,"<p>Nodal semimetals are classes of topological materials that have nodal-point or nodal-line Fermi surfaces, which give them novel transport and topological properties. Despite being highly sought after, there are currently very few experimental realizations, and identifying new materials candidates has mainly relied on exhaustive database searches. Here we show how recent studies on the interplay between electron filling and nonsymmorphic space-group symmetries can guide the search for filling-enforced nodal semimetals. We recast the previously derived constraints on the allowed band-insulator fillings in any space group into a new form, which enables effective screening of materials candidates based solely on their space group, electron count in the formula unit, and multiplicity of the formula unit. This criterion greatly reduces the computation load for discovering topological materials in a database of previously synthesized compounds. As a demonstration, we focus on a few selected nonsymmorphic space groups which are predicted to host filling-enforced Dirac semimetals. Of the more than 30,000 entires listed, our filling criterion alone eliminates 96% of the entries before they are passed on for further analysis. We discover a handful of candidates from this guided search; among them, the monoclinic crystal Ca<sub>2</sub>Pt<sub>2</sub>Ga is particularly promising.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, USA', 'authors': ['Ru Chen', ',\xa0Hoi Chun Po', ',\xa0Jeffrey B.

article,Quantum tricritical points in NbFe2,"<p>Quantum critical points (QCPs) emerge when a second-order phase transition is suppressed to zero temperature. In metals the quantum fluctuations at such a QCP can give rise to new phases, including unconventional superconductivity. Whereas antiferromagnetic QCPs have been studied in considerable detail, ferromagnetic (FM) QCPs are much harder to access. In almost all metals FM QCPs are avoided through either a change to first-order transitions or through an intervening spin-density-wave (SDW) phase. Here, we study the prototype of the second case, NbFe<sub>2</sub>. We demonstrate that the phase diagram can be modelled using a two-order-parameter theory in which the putative FM QCP is buried within a SDW phase. We establish the presence of quantum tricritical points (QTCPs) at which both the uniform and finite wavevector susceptibility diverge. The universal nature of our model suggests that such QTCPs arise naturally from the interplay between SDW and FM order and exist generically near a buried FM QCP of this type. Our results promote NbFe<sub>2</sub> as the first example of a QTCP, which has been proposed as a key concept in a range of narrow-band metals, including the prominent heavy-fermion compound YbRh<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>.</p>",,"[{'address': 'HH Wills Laboratory, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TL, UK', 'authors': ['Sven Friedemann']}, {'address': 'Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0HE, UK', 'authors': ['Sven Friedemann', ',\xa0Max Hirschberger', '\xa0&\xa0F.\xa0Malte Grosche']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham TW20 0EX, UK', 'authors': ['Will J.

article,Probing electronic binding potentials with attosecond photoelectron wavepackets,"<p>The central goal of attosecond science is to visualize, understand and ultimately control electron dynamics in matter over the fastest relevant timescales. To date, numerous schemes have demonstrated exquisite temporal resolution, on the order of ten attoseconds, in measurements of the response of photo-excited electrons to time-delayed probes. However, attributing this response to specific dynamical mechanisms is difficult, requiring guidance from advanced calculations. Here we show that energy transfer between an oscillating field and low-energy attosecond photoelectron wavepackets directly provides coarse-grained information on the effective binding potential from which the electrons are liberated. We employ a dense extreme ultraviolet (XUV) harmonic comb to photoionize He, Ne and Ar atoms and record the electron spectra as a function of the phase of a mid-infrared dressing field. The amplitude and phase of the resulting interference modulations in the electron spectra reveal the average momentum and change in momentum of the electron wavepackets during the first quarter-period of the dressing field after their creation, reflecting the corresponding coarse characteristics of the binding potential.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA', 'authors': ['D.

article,Laser amplification in excited dielectrics,"<p>Wide-bandgap dielectrics such as glasses or water are transparent at visible and infrared wavelengths. This changes when they are exposed to ultrashort and highly intense laser pulses. Different interaction mechanisms lead to the appearance of various transient nonlinear optical phenomena. Using these, the optical properties of dielectrics can be controlled from the transparent to the metal-like state. Here we expand this range by a yet unexplored mechanism in excited dielectrics: amplification. In a two-colour pump&#8211;probe experiment, we show that a 400&#8201;nm femtosecond laser pulse is coherently amplified inside an excited sapphire sample on a scale of a few micrometres.

In inertial confinement fusion experiments indirectly driven with lasers, many beams overlap in the plasma inside a hohlraum, and cross-beam energy transfer by Brillouin scattering has been employed to redistribute energy between laser beams within the target. Here, we show that in a hot, under-dense plasma the energy of many input beams can be combined into a single well-collimated beam. The emerging beam has an energy of 4&#8201;kJ (over 1&#8201;ns) that is more than triple that of any incident beam, and a fluence that is more than double. Because the optic produced is plasma, and is diffractive, it is inherently capable of generating higher fluences in a single beam than solid-state refractive or reflective optics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California 94551, USA', 'authors': ['R.

article,Curvature-induced defect unbinding and dynamics in active nematic toroids,"<p>Nematic order on curved surfaces is often disrupted by the presence of topological defects, which are singular regions in which the orientational order is undefined. In the presence of force-generating active materials, these defects are able to migrate through space like swimming microorganisms. We use toroidal surfaces to show that despite their highly chaotic and non-equilibrium dynamics, pairs of defects unbind and segregate in regions of opposite Gaussian curvature. Using numerical simulations, we find that the degree of defect unbinding can be controlled by tuning the system activity, and even suppressed in strongly active systems. Furthermore, by using the defects as active microrheological tracers and quantitatively comparing our experimental and theoretical results, we are able to determine material properties of the active nematic. Our results illustrate how topology and geometry can be used to control the behaviour of active materials, and introduce a new avenue for the quantitative mechanical characterization of active fluids.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332, USA', 'authors': ['Perry W.

article,Role of graph architecture in controlling dynamical networks with applications to neural systems,"<p>Networked systems display complex patterns of interactions between components. In physical networks, these interactions often occur along structural connections that link components in a hard-wired connection topology, supporting a variety of system-wide dynamical behaviours such as synchronization. Although descriptions of these behaviours are important, they are only a first step towards understanding and harnessing the relationship between network topology and system behaviour. Here, we use linear network control theory to derive accurate closed-form expressions that relate the connectivity of a subset of structural connections (those linking driver nodes to non-driver nodes) to the minimum energy required to control networked systems. To illustrate the utility of the mathematics, we apply this approach to high-resolution connectomes recently reconstructed from Drosophila, mouse, and human brains. We use these principles to suggest an advantage of the human brain in supporting diverse network dynamics with small energetic costs while remaining robust to perturbations, and to perform clinically accessible targeted manipulation of the brain&#8217;s control performance by removing single edges in the network. Generally, our results ground the expectation of a control system&#8217;s behaviour in its network architecture, and directly inspire new directions in network analysis and design via distributed control.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA', 'authors': ['Jason Z.
