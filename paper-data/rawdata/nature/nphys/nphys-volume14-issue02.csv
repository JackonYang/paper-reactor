article,Symmetry breaking by quantum coherence in single electron attachment,"<p>Quantum coherence-induced effects in atomic and molecular systems are the basis of several proposals for laser-based control of chemical reactions. So far, these rely on coherent photon beams inducing coherent reaction pathways that may interfere with one another, to achieve the desired outcome. This concept has been successfully exploited for removing the inversion symmetry in the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules, but it remains to be seen if such quantum coherent effects can also be generated by the interaction of incoherent electrons with such molecules. Here we show that resonant electron attachment to H<sub>2</sub> and the subsequent dissociation into H (n&#160;=&#160;2) + H<sup>&#8722;</sup> is asymmetric about the inter-nuclear axis, whereas the asymmetry in D<sub>2</sub> is far less pronounced. We explain this observation as due to attachment of a single electron resulting in a coherent superposition of two resonances of opposite parity. In addition to exemplifying a new quantum coherent process, our observation of coherent quantum dynamics involves the active participation of all three electrons and two nuclei, which could provide new tools for studying electron correlations as a means to control chemical processes, and demonstrates the role of coherent effects in electron-induced chemistry.</p>",[],False,"[""E.

article,Cooling quasiparticles in A3C60 fullerides by excitonic mid-infrared absorption,"<p>Long after its discovery, superconductivity in alkali fullerides A<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub> still challenges conventional wisdom. The freshest inroad in such ever-surprising physics is the behaviour under intense infrared excitation. Signatures attributable to a transient superconducting state extending up to temperatures ten times higher than the equilibrium T<sub>c</sub> &#8764; 20&#8201;K have been discovered in K<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub> after ultra-short pulsed infrared irradiation&#8212;an effect which still appears as remarkable as mysterious. Motivated by the observation that the phenomenon is observed in a broad pumping frequency range that coincides with the mid-infrared electronic absorption peak still of unclear origin, rather than to transverse optical phonons as has been proposed, we advance here a radically new mechanism. First, we argue that this broad absorption peak represents a &#8216;super-exciton&#8217; involving the promotion of one electron from the t<sub>1u</sub> half-filled state to a higher-energy empty t<sub>1g</sub> state, dramatically lowered in energy by the large dipole&#8211;dipole interaction acting in conjunction with the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect within the enormously degenerate manifold of (t<sub>1u</sub>)<sup>2</sup>(t<sub>1g</sub>)<sup>1</sup> states. Both long-lived and entropy-rich because they are triplets, the infrared-induced excitons act as a sort of cooling mechanism that permits transient superconductive signals to persist up to much higher temperatures.</p>",[],False,"[""Andrea Nava"", ""Claudio Giannetti"", ""Antoine Georges"", ""Erio Tosatti"", ""Michele Fabrizio""]","Nava, A., Giannetti, C., Georges, A. et al.

article,Experimentally probing topological order and its breakdown through modular matrices,"<p>The modern concept of phases of matter has undergone tremendous developments since the first observation of topologically ordered states in fractional quantum Hall systems in the 1980s. In this paper, we explore the following question: in principle, how much detail of the physics of topological orders can be observed using state of the art technologies? We find that using surprisingly little data, namely the toric code Hamiltonian in the presence of generic disorders and detuning from its exactly solvable point, the modular matrices&#8212;characterizing anyonic statistics that are some of the most fundamental fingerprints of topological orders&#8212;can be reconstructed with very good accuracy solely by experimental means. This is an experimental realization of these fundamental signatures of a topological order, a test of their robustness against perturbations, and a proof of principle&#8212;that current technologies have attained the precision to identify phases of matter and, as such, probe an extended region of phase space around the soluble point before its breakdown. Given the special role of anyonic statistics in quantum computation, our work promises myriad applications both in probing and realistically harnessing these exotic phases of matter.</p>",[],False,"[""Zhihuang Luo"", ""Jun Li"", ""Zhaokai Li"", ""Ling-Yan Hung"", ""Yidun Wan"", ""Xinhua Peng"", ""Jiangfeng Du""]","Luo, Z., Li, J., Li, Z. et al.

article,Fermi surface in the absence of a Fermi liquid in the Kondo insulator SmB6,"<p>The search for a Fermi surface in the absence of a conventional Fermi liquid has thus far yielded very few potential candidates. Among promising materials are spin-frustrated Mott insulators near the insulator&#8211;metal transition, where theory predicts a Fermi surface associated with neutral low-energy excitations. Here we reveal another route to experimentally realize a Fermi surface in the absence of a Fermi liquid by the experimental study of a Kondo insulator SmB<sub>6</sub> positioned close to the insulator&#8211;metal transition. We present experimental signatures down to low temperatures (&#8810;1&#8201;K) associated with a Fermi surface in the bulk, including a sizeable linear specific heat coefficient, and on the application of a finite magnetic field, bulk magnetic quantum oscillations, finite quantum oscillatory entropy, and substantial enhancement in thermal conductivity well below the charge gap energy scale. Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that despite an extreme instance of Fermi liquid breakdown in Kondo insulating SmB<sub>6</sub>, a Fermi surface arises from novel itinerant low-energy excitations that couple to magnetic fields, but not weak DC electric fields.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

article,Quantum gas microscopy of an attractive Fermi–Hubbard system,"<p>The attractive Fermi&#8211;Hubbard model is the simplest theoretical model for studying pairing and superconductivity of fermions on a lattice. It exhibits many interesting features including a short-coherence length at intermediate coupling and a pseudogap regime with anomalous properties. Here we study an experimental realization of this model using a two-dimensional (2D) atomic Fermi gas in an optical lattice. Using a new technique for selective imaging of doublons with a quantum gas microscope, we observe chequerboard doublon density correlations in the normal state close to half-filling. With the aid of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the measured doublon density correlations allow us to put a lower bound on the strength of s-wave pairing correlations in our system. We compare the temperature sensitivity of the doublon density correlations and the paired atom fraction and find the correlations to be a much better thermometer. Accurate thermometry of attractive lattice systems will be essential in the quest for optimizing cooling schemes to reach superfluid phases in future experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Debayan Mitra"", ""Peter T.

article,Unconventional mass enhancement around the Dirac nodal loop in ZrSiS,"<p>The topological properties of fermions arise from their low-energy Dirac-like band dispersion and associated chirality. Initially confined to points, extensions of the Dirac dispersion to lines, and even loops, have now been uncovered, and semimetals hosting such features have been identified. However, experimental evidence for the enhanced correlation effects predicted to occur in these topological semimetals has been lacking. Here, we report a quantum oscillation study of the nodal-loop semimetal ZrSiS in high magnetic fields that reveals significant enhancement in the effective mass of the quasiparticles residing near the nodal loop. Above a threshold field, magnetic breakdown occurs across gaps in the loop structure with orbits that enclose different windings around its vertices, each winding accompanied by an additional &#960; Berry phase. The amplitudes of these breakdown orbits exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence. These findings demonstrate the emergence of novel, correlation-driven physics in ZrSiS associated with the Dirac-like quasiparticles.</p>",[],False,"[""S. Pezzini"", ""M. R. van Delft"", ""L. M.

The large transfer width of the instrument allows us to employ spot-profile analysis, resolving the phase-ordering kinetics in the nascent incommensurate charge density wave phase. We observe a coarsening that follows a power-law scaling of the correlation length, driven by the annihilation of dislocation-type topological defects of the charge-ordered lattice.

article,How drops start sliding over solid surfaces,"<p>It has been known for more than 200 years that the maximum static friction force between two solid surfaces is usually greater than the kinetic friction force&#8212;the force that is required to maintain the relative motion of the surfaces once the static force has been overcome. But the forces that impede the lateral motion of a drop of liquid on a solid surface are not as well characterized, and there is a lack of understanding about liquid&#8211;solid friction in general. Here, we report that the lateral adhesion force between a liquid drop and a solid can also be divided into a static and a kinetic regime. This striking analogy with solid&#8211;solid friction is a generic phenomenon that holds for liquids of different polarities and surface tensions on smooth, rough and structured surfaces.</p>",[],False,"[""Nan Gao"", ""Florian Geyer"", ""Dominik W.
