Although recent research has focused on monolayer stanene, the quantum size effect in few-layer stanene could profoundly change material properties, but remains unexplored. By exploring the layer degree of freedom, we discover superconductivity in few-layer stanene down to a bilayer grown on PbTe, while bulk &#945;-tin is not superconductive. Through substrate engineering, we further realize a transition from a single-band to a two-band superconductor with a doubling of the transition temperature. In situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) together with first-principles calculations elucidate the corresponding band structure.

letter,Three-component fermions with surface Fermi arcs in tungsten carbide,"<p>Topological Dirac and Weyl semimetals not only host quasiparticles analogous to the elementary fermionic particles in high-energy physics, but also have a non-trivial band topology manifested by gapless surface states, which induce exotic surface Fermi arcs. Recent advances suggest new types of topological semimetal, in which spatial symmetries protect gapless electronic excitations without high-energy analogues. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe triply degenerate nodal points near the Fermi level of tungsten carbide with space group \(P\bar{6}m2\) (no. 187), in which the low-energy quasiparticles are described as three-component fermions distinct from Dirac and Weyl fermions. We further observe topological surface states, whose constant-energy contours constitute pairs of &#8216;Fermi arcs&#8217; connecting to the surface projections of the triply degenerate nodal points, proving the non-trivial topology of the newly identified semimetal state.</p>",[],False,"[""J.-Z.

letter,Giant spin-splitting and gap renormalization driven by trions in single-layer WS2/h-BN heterostructures,"<p>In two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), new electronic phenomena such as tunable bandgaps and strongly bound excitons and trions emerge from strong many-body effects, beyond the spin and valley degrees of freedom induced by spin&#8211;orbit coupling and by lattice symmetry. Combining single-layer TMDs with other 2D materials in van der Waals heterostructures offers an intriguing means of controlling the electronic properties through these many-body effects, by means of engineered interlayer interactions. Here, we use micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) and in situ surface doping to manipulate the electronic structure of single-layer WS<sub>2</sub> on hexagonal boron nitride (WS<sub>2</sub>/h-BN). Upon electron doping, we observe an unexpected giant renormalization of the spin&#8211;orbit splitting of the single-layer WS<sub>2</sub> valence band, from 430&#8201;meV to 660&#8201;meV, together with a bandgap reduction of at least 325&#8201;meV, attributed to the formation of trionic quasiparticles. These findings suggest that the electronic, spintronic and excitonic properties are widely tunable in 2D TMD/h-BN heterostructures, as these are intimately linked to the quasiparticle dynamics of the materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Jyoti Katoch"", ""S\u00f8ren Ulstrup"", ""Roland J.

letter,Self-hybridization within non-Hermitian localized plasmonic systems,"<p>The orthogonal eigenmodes are well-defined solutions of Hermitian equations describing many physical situations from quantum mechanics to acoustics. However, a large variety of non-Hermitian problems, including gravitational waves close to black holes or leaky electromagnetic cavities, require the use of a bi-orthogonal eigenbasis with consequences challenging our physical understanding. The need to compensate for energy losses made the few successful attempts to experimentally probe non-Hermiticity extremely complicated. We overcome this problem by considering localized plasmonic systems. As the non-Hermiticity in these systems does not stem from temporal invariance breaking but from spatial symmetry breaking, its consequences can be observed more easily. We report on the theoretical and experimental evidence for non-Hermiticity-induced strong coupling between surface plasmon modes of different orders within silver nanodaggers. The symmetry conditions for triggering this counter-intuitive self-hybridization phenomenon are provided.

letter,Signatures of a dissipative phase transition in photon correlation measurements,"<p>Understanding and characterizing phase transitions in driven-dissipative systems constitutes a new frontier for many-body physics. A generic feature of dissipative phase transitions is a vanishing gap in the Liouvillian spectrum, which leads to long-lived deviations from the steady state as the system is driven towards the transition. Here, we show that photon correlation measurements can be used to characterize the corresponding critical slowing down of non-equilibrium dynamics. We focus on the extensively studied phenomenon of optical bistability in GaAs cavity polaritons, which can be described as a first-order dissipative phase transition. Increasing the excitation strength towards the bistable range results in an increasing photon-bunching signal along with a decay time that is prolonged by more than nine orders of magnitude as compared with that of single polaritons. In the limit of strong polariton interactions leading to pronounced quantum fluctuations, the mean-field bistability threshold is washed out. Nevertheless, the functional form with which the Liouvillian gap closes as the thermodynamic limit is approached provides a signature of the emerging dissipative phase transition. Our results establish photon correlation measurements as an invaluable tool for studying dynamical properties of dissipative phase transitions without requiring phase-sensitive interferometric measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""Thomas Fink"", ""Anne Schade"", ""Sven H\u00f6fling"", ""Christian Schneider"", ""Ata\u00e7 Imamoglu""]","Fink, T., Schade, A., Höfling, S. et al.

letter,Femtosecond activation of magnetoelectricity,"<p>In magnetoelectric and multiferroic materials, the magnetic degree of freedom can be controlled by electric field, and vice versa. A significant amount of research has been devoted to exploiting this effect for magnetoelectric data storage and manipulation devices driven by d.c. electric fields. Aiming at ever-faster schemes of magnetoelectric manipulation, a promising alternative approach offers similar control on a femtosecond timescale, relying on laser pulses to control both the charge and the magnetic order of solids. Here we photo-induce magnetoelectricity and multiferroicity in CuB<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> on a sub-picosecond timescale. This process is triggered by the resonant optical generation of the highest-energy magnetic excitations&#8212;magnons with wavevectors near the edges of the Brillouin zone. The most striking consequence of the photo-excitation is that the absorption of light becomes non-reciprocal, which means that the material exhibits a different transparency for two opposite directions of propagation of light. The photo-induced magnetoelectricity does not show any decay on the picosecond timescale. Our findings uncover a path for ultrafast manipulations of the intrinsic coupling between charges and spins in multiferroics, which may reveal unexplored magnetic configurations and unravel new functionalities in terms of femtosecond optical control of magnetism.</p>",[],False,"[""D.

letter,Interaction modifiers in artificial spin ices,"<p>The modification of geometry and interactions in two-dimensional magnetic nanosystems has enabled a range of studies addressing the magnetic order, collective low-energy dynamics and emergent magnetic properties in, for example, artificial spin-ice structures. The common denominator of all these investigations is the use of Ising-like mesospins as building blocks, in the form of elongated magnetic islands. Here, we introduce a new approach: single interaction modifiers, using slave mesospins in the form of discs, within which the mesospin is free to rotate in the disc plane. We show that by placing these on the vertices of square artificial spin-ice arrays and varying their diameter, it is possible to tailor the strength and the ratio of the interaction energies. We demonstrate the existence of degenerate ice-rule-obeying states in square artificial spin-ice structures, enabling the exploration of thermal dynamics in a spin-liquid manifold. Furthermore, we even observe the emergence of flux lattices on larger length scales, when the energy landscape of the vertices is reversed. The work highlights the potential of a design strategy for two-dimensional magnetic nano-architectures, through which mixed dimensionality of mesospins can be used to promote thermally emergent mesoscale magnetic states.</p>",[],False,"[""Erik \u00d6stman"", ""Henry Stopfel"", ""Ioan-Augustin Chioar"", ""Unnar B.

letter,Amorphous topological insulators constructed from random point sets,"<p>The discovery that the band structure of electronic insulators may be topologically non-trivial has revealed distinct phases of electronic matter with novel properties. Recently, mechanical lattices have been found to have similarly rich structure in their phononic excitations, giving rise to protected unidirectional edge modes. In all of these cases, however, as well as in other topological metamaterials, the underlying structure was finely tuned, be it through periodicity, quasi-periodicity or isostaticity. Here we show that amorphous Chern insulators can be readily constructed from arbitrary underlying structures, including hyperuniform, jammed, quasi-crystalline and uniformly random point sets. While our findings apply to mechanical and electronic systems alike, we focus on networks of interacting gyroscopes as a model system. Local decorations control the topology of the vibrational spectrum, endowing amorphous structures with protected edge modes&#8212;with a chirality of choice. Using a real-space generalization of the Chern number, we investigate the topology of our structures numerically, analytically and experimentally.

letter,Destabilizing turbulence in pipe flow,"<p>Turbulence is the major cause of friction losses in transport processes and it is responsible for a drastic drag increase in flows over bounding surfaces. While much effort is invested into developing ways to control and reduce turbulence intensities, so far no methods exist to altogether eliminate turbulence if velocities are sufficiently large. We demonstrate for pipe flow that appropriate distortions to the velocity profile lead to a complete collapse of turbulence and subsequently friction losses are reduced by as much as 90%. Counterintuitively, the return to laminar motion is accomplished by initially increasing turbulence intensities or by transiently amplifying wall shear. Since neither the Reynolds number nor the shear stresses decrease (the latter often increase), these measures are not indicative of turbulence collapse.

letter,Critical regimes driven by recurrent mobility patterns of reaction–diffusion processes in networks,"<p>Reaction&#8211;diffusion processes have been widely used to study dynamical processes in epidemics and ecology in networked metapopulations. In the context of epidemics, reaction processes are understood as contagions within each subpopulation (patch), while diffusion represents the mobility of individuals between patches. Recently, the characteristics of human mobility, such as its recurrent nature, have been proven crucial to understand the phase transition to endemic epidemic states. Here, by developing a framework able to cope with the elementary epidemic processes, the spatial distribution of populations and the commuting mobility patterns, we discover three different critical regimes of the epidemic incidence as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, we reveal a regime of the reaction&#8211;diffussion process in which, counter-intuitively, mobility is detrimental to the spread of disease. We analytically determine the precise conditions for the emergence of any of the three possible critical regimes in real and synthetic networks.</p>",[],False,"[""J. G\u00f3mez-Garde\u00f1es"", ""D.

letter,Linking high-energy cosmic particles by black-hole jets embedded in large-scale structures,"<p>The origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is a half-century-old enigma. The mystery has been deepened by an intriguing coincidence: over ten orders of magnitude in energy, the energy generation rates of UHECRs, PeV neutrinos and isotropic sub-TeV &#947;-rays are comparable, which hints at a grand unified picture. Here we report that powerful black hole jets in aggregates of galaxies can supply the common origin for all of these phenomena. Once accelerated by a jet, low-energy cosmic rays confined in the radio lobe are adiabatically cooled; higher-energy cosmic rays leaving the source interact with the magnetized cluster environment and produce neutrinos and &#947;-rays; the highest-energy particles escape from the host cluster and contribute to the observed cosmic rays above 100&#8201;PeV. The model is consistent with the spectrum, composition and isotropy of the observed UHECRs, and also explains the IceCube neutrinos and the non-blazar component of the Fermi &#947;-ray background, assuming a reasonable energy output from black hole jets in clusters.</p>",[],False,"[""Ke Fang"", ""Kohta Murase""]","Fang, K., Murase, K.

article,Dynamics of interacting fermions under spin–orbit coupling in an optical lattice clock,"<p>Quantum statistics and symmetrization dictate that identical fermions do not interact via s-wave collisions. However, in the presence of spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC), fermions prepared in identical internal states with distinct momenta become distinguishable. The resulting strongly interacting system can exhibit exotic topological and pairing behaviours, many of which are yet to be observed in condensed matter systems. Ultracold atomic gases offer a promising pathway for simulating these rich phenomena, but until recently have been hindered by heating and losses. Here we enter a new regime of many-body interacting SOC in a fermionic optical lattice clock (OLC), where the long-lived electronic clock states mitigate unwanted dissipation. Using clock spectroscopy, we observe the precession of the collective magnetization and the emergence of spin-locking effects arising from an interplay between p-wave and SOC-induced exchange interactions. The many-body dynamics are well captured by a collective XXZ spin model, which describes a broad class of condensed matter systems ranging from superconductors to quantum magnets. Furthermore, our work will aid in the design of next-generation OLCs by offering a route for avoiding the observed large density shifts caused by SOC-induced exchange interactions.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

article,A quantum dipolar spin liquid,"<p>Quantum spin liquids are a class of magnetic ground states reliant on non-local entanglement. Motivated by recent advances in the control of ultracold polar molecules and the development of dipolar quantum materials, we show that dipolar interactions between S&#8201;=&#8201;1/2 moments stabilize spin liquids on the triangular and kagome lattices. In the latter case, the moments spontaneously break time-reversal, forming a chiral spin liquid with robust edge modes and emergent semions.

article,Robust integer and fractional helical modes in the quantum Hall effect,"<p>Electronic systems harboring one-dimensional helical modes, where spin and momentum are locked, have lately become an important field of their own. When coupled to a conventional superconductor, such systems are expected to manifest topological superconductivity; a unique phase hosting exotic Majorana zero modes. Even more interesting are fractional helical modes, yet to be observed, which open the route for realizing generalized parafermions. Possessing non-Abelian exchange statistics, these quasiparticles may serve as building blocks in topological quantum computing. Here, we present a new approach to form protected one-dimensional helical edge modes in the quantum Hall regime. The novel platform is based on a carefully designed double-quantum-well structure in a GaAs-based system hosting two electronic sub-bands; each tuned to the quantum Hall effect regime. By electrostatic gating of different areas of the structure, counter-propagating integer, as well as fractional, edge modes with opposite spins are formed. We demonstrate that, due to spin protection, these helical modes remain ballistic over large distances. In addition to the formation of helical modes, this platform can serve as a rich playground for artificial induction of compounded fractional edge modes, and for construction of edge-mode-based interferometers.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuval Ronen"", ""Yonatan Cohen"", ""Daniel Banitt"", ""Moty Heiblum"", ""Vladimir Umansky""]","Ronen, Y., Cohen, Y., Banitt, D. et al.

article,Wall roughness induces asymptotic ultimate turbulence,"<p>Turbulence governs the transport of heat, mass and momentum on multiple scales. In real-world applications, wall-bounded turbulence typically involves surfaces that are rough; however, characterizing and understanding the effects of wall roughness on turbulence remains a challenge. Here, by combining extensive experiments and numerical simulations, we examine the paradigmatic Taylor&#8211;Couette system, which describes the closed flow between two independently rotating coaxial cylinders. We show how wall roughness greatly enhances the overall transport properties and the corresponding scaling exponents associated with wall-bounded turbulence. We reveal that if only one of the walls is rough, the bulk velocity is slaved to the rough side, due to the much stronger coupling to that wall by the detaching flow structures. If both walls are rough, the viscosity dependence is eliminated, giving rise to asymptotic ultimate turbulence&#8212;the upper limit of transport&#8212;the existence of which was predicted more than 50 years ago. In this limit, the scaling laws can be extrapolated to arbitrarily large Reynolds numbers.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaojue Zhu"", ""Ruben A. Verschoof"", ""Dennis Bakhuis"", ""Sander G.
