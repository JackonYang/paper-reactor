letter,Geodesy and metrology with a transportable optical clock,"<p>Optical atomic clocks, due to their unprecedented stability and uncertainty, are already being used to test physical theories and herald a revision of the International System of Units. However, to unlock their potential for cross-disciplinary applications such as relativistic geodesy, a major challenge remains: their transformation from highly specialized instruments restricted to national metrology laboratories into flexible devices deployable in different locations. Here, we report the first field measurement campaign with a transportable <sup>87</sup>Sr optical lattice clock. We use it to determine the gravity potential difference between the middle of a mountain and a location 90&#8201;km away, exploiting both local and remote clock comparisons to eliminate potential clock errors. A local comparison with a <sup>171</sup>Yb lattice clock also serves as an important check on the international consistency of independently developed optical clocks.

letter,Observation of roton mode population in a dipolar quantum gas,"<p>The concept of a roton, a special kind of elementary excitation forming a minimum of energy at finite momentum, has been essential for the understanding of the properties of superfluid <sup>4</sup>He (ref.&#8201;). In quantum liquids, rotons arise from the strong interparticle interactions, whose microscopic description remains debated. In the realm of highly controllable quantum gases, a roton mode has been predicted to emerge due to magnetic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions despite their weakly interacting character. This prospect has raised considerable interest; yet roton modes in dipolar quantum gases have remained elusive to observations. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies of the momentum distribution in Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates of highly magnetic erbium atoms, revealing the existence of the long-sought roton mode. Following an interaction quench, the roton mode manifests itself with the appearance of symmetric peaks at well-defined finite momentum. The roton momentum follows the predicted geometrical scaling with the inverse of the confinement length along the magnetization axis. From the growth of the roton population, we probe the roton softening of the excitation spectrum in time and extract the corresponding imaginary roton gap. Our results provide a further step in the quest towards supersolidity in dipolar quantum gases.</p>",[],False,"[""L. Chomaz"", ""R. M. W. van Bijnen"", ""D. Petter"", ""G. Faraoni"", ""S.

letter,Neural-network quantum state tomography,"<p>The experimental realization of increasingly complex synthetic quantum systems calls for the development of general theoretical methods to validate and fully exploit quantum resources. Quantum state tomography (QST) aims to reconstruct the full quantum state from simple measurements, and therefore provides a key tool to obtain reliable analytics. However, exact brute-force approaches to QST place a high demand on computational resources, making them unfeasible for anything except small systems. Here we show how machine learning techniques can be used to perform QST of highly entangled states with more than a hundred qubits, to a high degree of accuracy. We demonstrate that machine learning allows one to reconstruct traditionally challenging many-body quantities&#8212;such as the entanglement entropy&#8212;from simple, experimentally accessible measurements.

letter,Anomalous Hall effect in ZrTe5,"<p>Research in topological matter has expanded to include the Dirac and Weyl semimetals, which feature three-dimensional Dirac states protected by symmetry. Zirconium pentatelluride has been of recent interest as a potential Dirac or Weyl semimetal material. Here, we report the results of experiments performed by in situ three-dimensional double-axis rotation to extract the full 4&#960; solid angular dependence of the transport properties. A clear anomalous Hall effect is detected in every sample studied, with no magnetic ordering observed in the system to the experimental sensitivity of torque magnetometry. Large anomalous Hall signals develop when the magnetic field is rotated in the plane of the stacked quasi-two-dimensional layers, with the values vanishing above about 60 K, where the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance also disappears. This suggests a close relation in their origins, which we attribute to the Berry curvature generated by the Weyl nodes.</p>",[],False,"[""Tian Liang"", ""Jingjing Lin"", ""Quinn Gibson"", ""Satya Kushwaha"", ""Minhao Liu"", ""Wudi Wang"", ""Hongyu Xiong"", ""Jonathan A.

letter,Tunable emergent heterostructures in a prototypical correlated metal,"<p>At the interface between two distinct materials, desirable properties, such as superconductivity, can be greatly enhanced, or entirely new functionalities may emerge. Similar to in artificially engineered heterostructures, clean functional interfaces alternatively exist in electronically textured bulk materials. Electronic textures emerge spontaneously due to competing atomic-scale interactions, the control of which would enable a top-down approach for designing tunable intrinsic heterostructures. This is particularly attractive for correlated electron materials, where spontaneous heterostructures strongly affect the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom. Here we report high-resolution neutron spectroscopy on the prototypical strongly correlated metal CeRhIn<sub>5</sub>, revealing competition between magnetic frustration and easy-axis anisotropy&#8212;a well-established mechanism for generating spontaneous superstructures. Because the observed easy-axis anisotropy is field-induced and anomalously large, it can be controlled efficiently with small magnetic fields. The resulting field-controlled magnetic superstructure is closely tied to the formation of superconducting and electronic nematic textures in CeRhIn<sub>5</sub>, suggesting that in situ tunable heterostructures can be realized in correlated electron materials.</p>",[],False,"[""D.

letter,Experimental discovery of nodal chains,"<p>Three-dimensional Weyl and Dirac nodal points have attracted widespread interest across multiple disciplines and in many platforms but allow for few structural variations. In contrast, nodal lines can have numerous topological configurations in momentum space, forming nodal rings, nodal chains, nodal links and nodal knots. However, nodal lines are much less explored because of the lack of an ideal experimental realization. For example, in condensed-matter systems, nodal lines are often fragile to spin&#8211;orbit coupling, located away from the Fermi level, coexist with energy-degenerate trivial bands or have a degeneracy line that disperses strongly in energy. Here, overcoming all these difficulties, we theoretically predict and experimentally observe nodal chains in a metallic-mesh photonic crystal having frequency-isolated linear band-touching rings chained across the entire Brillouin zone. These nodal chains are protected by mirror symmetry and have a frequency variation of less than 1%. We use angle-resolved transmission measurements to probe the projected bulk dispersion and perform Fourier-transformed field scans to map out the dispersion of the drumhead surface state. Our results establish an ideal nodal-line material for further study of topological line degeneracies with non-trivial connectivity and consequent wave dynamics that are richer than those in Weyl and Dirac materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Qinghui Yan"", ""Rongjuan Liu"", ""Zhongbo Yan"", ""Boyuan Liu"", ""Hongsheng Chen"", ""Zhong Wang"", ""Ling Lu""]","Yan, Q., Liu, R., Yan, Z. et al.

letter,Topological domain walls in helimagnets,"<p>Domain walls naturally arise whenever a symmetry is spontaneously broken. They interconnect regions with different realizations of the broken symmetry, promoting structure formation from cosmological length scales to the atomic level. In ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, domain walls with unique functionalities emerge, holding great promise for nanoelectronics and spintronics applications. These walls are usually of Ising, Bloch or N&#233;el type and separate homogeneously ordered domains. Here we demonstrate that a wide variety of new domain walls occurs in the presence of spatially modulated domain states. Using magnetic force microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we show three fundamental classes of domain walls to arise in the near-room-temperature helimagnet iron germanium. In contrast to conventional ferroics, the domain walls exhibit a well-defined inner structure, which&#8212;analogous to cholesteric liquid crystals&#8212;consists of topological disclination and dislocation defects. Similar to the magnetic skyrmions that form in the same material, the domain walls can carry a finite topological charge, permitting an efficient coupling to spin currents and contributions to a topological Hall effect. Our study establishes a new family of magnetic nano-objects with non-trivial topology, opening the door to innovative device concepts based on helimagnetic domain walls.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

letter,Universality of clone dynamics during tissue development,"<p>The emergence of complex organs is driven by the coordinated proliferation, migration and differentiation of precursor cells. The fate behaviour of these cells is reflected in the time evolution of their progeny, termed clones, which serve as a key experimental observable. In adult tissues, where cell dynamics is constrained by the condition of homeostasis, clonal tracing studies based on transgenic animal models have advanced our understanding of cell fate behaviour and its dysregulation in disease. But what can be learnt from clonal dynamics in development, where the spatial cohesiveness of clones is impaired by tissue deformations during tissue growth? Drawing on the results of clonal tracing studies, we show that, despite the complexity of organ development, clonal dynamics may converge to a critical state characterized by universal scaling behaviour of clone sizes. By mapping clonal dynamics onto a generalization of the classical theory of aerosols, we elucidate the origin and range of scaling behaviours and show how the identification of universal scaling dependences may allow lineage-specific information to be distilled from experiments. Our study shows the emergence of core concepts of statistical physics in an unexpected context, identifying cellular systems as a laboratory to study non-equilibrium statistical physics.</p>",[],False,"[""Steffen Rulands"", ""Fabienne Lescroart"", ""Samira Chabab"", ""Christopher J.

letter,Electron acceleration by wave turbulence in a magnetized plasma,"<p>Astrophysical shocks are commonly revealed by the non-thermal emission of energetic electrons accelerated in situ. Strong shocks are expected to accelerate particles to very high energies; however, they require a source of particles with velocities fast enough to permit multiple shock crossings. While the resulting diffusive shock acceleration process can account for observations, the kinetic physics regulating the continuous injection of non-thermal particles is not well understood. Indeed, this injection problem is particularly acute for electrons, which rely on high-frequency plasma fluctuations to raise them above the thermal pool. Here we show, using laboratory laser-produced shock experiments, that, in the presence of a strong magnetic field, significant electron pre-heating is achieved. We demonstrate that the key mechanism in producing these energetic electrons is through the generation of lower-hybrid turbulence via shock-reflected ions. Our experimental results are analogous to many astrophysical systems, including the interaction of a comet with the solar wind, a setting where electron acceleration via lower-hybrid waves is possible.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

letter,Alfvén wave dissipation in the solar chromosphere,"<p>Magnetohydrodynamic Alfv&#233;n waves have been a focus of laboratory plasma physics and astrophysics for over half a century. Their unique nature makes them ideal energy transporters, and while the solar atmosphere provides preferential conditions for their existence, direct detection has proved difficult as a result of their evolving and dynamic observational signatures. The viability of Alfv&#233;n waves as a heating mechanism relies upon the efficient dissipation and thermalization of the wave energy, with direct evidence remaining elusive until now. Here we provide the first observational evidence of Alfv&#233;n waves heating chromospheric plasma in a sunspot umbra through the formation of shock fronts. The magnetic field configuration of the shock environment, alongside the tangential velocity signatures, distinguish them from conventional umbral flashes. Observed local temperature enhancements of 5% are consistent with the dissipation of mode-converted Alfv&#233;n waves driven by upwardly propagating magneto-acoustic oscillations, providing an unprecedented insight into the behaviour of Alfv&#233;n waves in the solar atmosphere and beyond.</p>",[],False,"[""Samuel D.

The standard technique of chiral discrimination&#8212;photoabsorption circular dichroism&#8212;relies on the magnetic properties of a chiral medium and yields an extremely weak chiral response. Here, we propose and demonstrate an orders of magnitude more sensitive type of circular dichroism in neutral molecules: photoexcitation circular dichroism. This technique does not rely on weak magnetic effects, but takes advantage of the coherent helical motion of bound electrons excited by ultrashort circularly polarized light. It results in an ultrafast chiral response and the efficient excitation of a macroscopic chiral density in an initially isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We probe this excitation using linearly polarized laser pulses, without the aid of further chiral interactions. Our time-resolved study of vibronic chiral dynamics opens a way to the efficient initiation, control and monitoring of chiral chemical change in neutral molecules at the level of electrons.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

article,Emergence of anisotropic Gilbert damping in ultrathin Fe layers on GaAs(001),"<p>As a fundamental parameter in magnetism, the phenomenological Gilbert damping constant &#945; determines the performance of many spintronic devices. For most magnetic materials, &#945; is treated as an isotropic parameter entering the Landau&#8211;Lifshitz&#8211;Gilbert equation. However, could the Gilbert damping be anisotropic? Although several theoretical approaches have suggested that anisotropic &#945; could appear in single-crystalline bulk systems, experimental evidence of its existence is scarce. Here, we report the emergence of anisotropic magnetic damping by exploring a quasi-two-dimensional single-crystalline ferromagnetic metal/semiconductor interface&#8212;that is, a Fe/GaAs(001) heterojunction. The observed anisotropic damping shows twofold C<sub>2v</sub> symmetry, which is expected from the interplay of interfacial Rashba and Dresselhaus spin&#8211;orbit interaction, and is manifested by the anisotropic density of states at the Fe/GaAs (001) interface. This discovery of anisotropic damping will enrich the understanding of magnetization relaxation mechanisms and can provide a route towards the search for anisotropic damping at other ferromagnetic metal/semiconductor interfaces.</p>",[],False,"[""L.

article,Bilinear magnetoelectric resistance as a probe of three-dimensional spin texture in topological surface states,"<p>Surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators exhibit the phenomenon of spin&#8211;momentum locking, whereby the orientation of an electron spin is determined by its momentum. Probing the spin texture of these states is of critical importance for the realization of topological insulator devices, but the main technique currently available is spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Here we reveal a close link between the spin texture and a new kind of magnetoresistance, which depends on the relative orientation of the current with respect to the magnetic field as well as the crystallographic axes, and scales linearly with both the applied electric and magnetic fields. This bilinear magnetoelectric resistance can be used to map the spin texture of topological surface states by simple transport measurements. For a prototypical Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> single layer, we can map both the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the spin texture (the latter arising from hexagonal warping). Theoretical calculations suggest that the bilinear magnetoelectric resistance originates from conversion of a non-equilibrium spin current into a charge current under application of the external magnetic field.</p>",[],False,"[""Pan He"", ""Steven S.-L.

article,Detecting the phonon spin in magnon–phonon conversion experiments,"<p>Recent advances in the emerging field of magnon spintronics have stimulated renewed interest in phenomena involving the interaction between spin waves, the collective excitations of spins in magnetic materials that quantize as magnons, and the elastic waves that arise from excitations in the crystal lattice, which quantize as phonons. In magnetic insulators, owing to the magnetostrictive properties of materials, spin waves can become strongly coupled to elastic waves, forming magnetoelastic waves&#8212;a hybridized magnon&#8211;phonon excitation. While several aspects of this interaction have been subject to recent scrutiny, it remains unclear whether or not phonons can carry spin. Here we report experiments on a film of the ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet under a non-uniform magnetic field demonstrating the conversion of coherent magnons generated by a microwave field into phonons that have spin. While it is well established that photons in circularly polarized light carry a spin, the spin of phonons has had little attention in the literature. By means of wavevector-resolved Brillouin light-scattering measurements, we show that the magnon&#8211;phonon conversion occurs with constant energy and varying linear momentum, and that the light scattered by the phonons is circularly polarized, thus demonstrating that the phonons have spin.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Rethinking pattern formation in reaction–diffusion systems,"<p>The present theoretical framework for the analysis of pattern formation in complex systems is mostly limited to the vicinity of fixed (global) equilibria. Here we present a new theoretical approach to characterize dynamical states arbitrarily far from (global) equilibrium. We show that reaction&#8211;diffusion systems that are driven by locally mass-conserving interactions can be understood in terms of local equilibria of diffusively coupled compartments. Diffusive coupling generically induces lateral redistribution of the globally conserved quantities, and the variable local amounts of these quantities determine the local equilibria in each compartment. We find that, even far from global equilibrium, the system is well characterized by its moving local equilibria. We apply this framework to in vitro Min protein pattern formation, a paradigmatic model for biological pattern formation. Within our framework we can predict and explain transitions between chemical turbulence and order arbitrarily far from global equilibrium. Our results reveal conceptually new principles of self-organized pattern formation that may well govern diverse dynamical systems.</p>",[],False,"[""J. Halatek"", ""E. Frey""]","Halatek, J., Frey, E.

article,Human brain organoids on a chip reveal the physics of folding,"<p>Human brain wrinkling has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and yet its origins remain unknown. Polymer gel models suggest that wrinkling emerges spontaneously due to compression forces arising during differential swelling, but these ideas have not been tested in a living system. Here, we report the appearance of surface wrinkles during the in vitro development and self-organization of human brain organoids in a microfabricated compartment that supports in situ imaging over a timescale of weeks. We observe the emergence of convolutions at a critical cell density and maximal nuclear strain, which are indicative of a mechanical instability. We identify two opposing forces contributing to differential growth: cytoskeletal contraction at the organoid core and cell-cycle-dependent nuclear expansion at the organoid perimeter. The wrinkling wavelength exhibits linear scaling with tissue thickness, consistent with balanced bending and stretching energies. Lissencephalic (smooth brain) organoids display reduced convolutions, modified scaling and a reduced elastic modulus. Although the mechanism here does not include the neuronal migration seen in vivo, it models the physics of the folding brain remarkably well. Our on-chip approach offers a means for studying the emergent properties of organoid development, with implications for the embryonic human brain.</p>",[],False,"[""Eyal Karzbrun"", ""Aditya Kshirsagar"", ""Sidney R.
