letter,Network structure from rich but noisy data,"<p>Driven by growing interest across the sciences, a large number of empirical studies have been conducted in recent years of the structure of networks ranging from the Internet and the World Wide Web to biological networks and social networks. The data produced by these experiments are often rich and multimodal, yet at the same time they may contain substantial measurement error. Accurate analysis and understanding of networked systems requires a way of estimating the true structure of networks from such rich but noisy data. Here we describe a technique that allows us to make optimal estimates of network structure from complex data in arbitrary formats, including cases where there may be measurements of many different types, repeated observations, contradictory observations, annotations or metadata, or missing data. We give example applications to two different social networks, one derived from face-to-face interactions and one from self-reported friendships.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and Center for the Study of Complex Systems, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA', 'authors': ['M.

letter,Quantum non-demolition detection of an itinerant microwave photon,"<p>Photon detectors are an elementary tool to measure electromagnetic waves at the quantum limit and are heavily demanded in the emerging quantum technologies such as communication, sensing and computing. Of particular interest is a quantum non-demolition (QND)-type detector, which projects an electromagnetic wave onto the photon-number basis. This is in stark contrast to conventional photon detectors that absorb a photon to trigger a &#8216;click&#8217;. The long-sought QND detection of a flying photon was recently demonstrated in the optical domain using a single atom in a cavity. However, the counterpart for microwaves has been elusive despite the recent progress in microwave quantum optics using superconducting circuits. Here, we implement a deterministic entangling gate between a superconducting qubit and an itinerant microwave photon reflected by a cavity containing the qubit. Using the entanglement and the high-fidelity qubit readout, we demonstrate a QND detection of a single photon with the quantum efficiency of 0.84 and the photon survival probability of 0.87. Our scheme can serve as a building block for quantum networks connecting distant qubit modules as well as a microwave-photon-counting device for multiple-photon signals.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan', 'authors': ['S.

letter,A strongly interacting polaritonic quantum dot,"<p>Polaritons are promising constituents of both synthetic quantum matter and quantum information processors, whose properties emerge from their components: from light, polaritons draw fast dynamics and ease of transport; from matter, they inherit the ability to collide with one another. Cavity polaritons are particularly promising as they may be confined and subjected to synthetic magnetic fields controlled by cavity geometry, and furthermore they benefit from increased robustness due to the cavity enhancement in light&#8211;matter coupling. Nonetheless, until now, cavity polaritons have operated only in a weakly interacting mean-field regime. Here we demonstrate strong interactions between individual cavity polaritons enabled by employing highly excited Rydberg atoms as the matter component of the polaritons. We assemble a quantum dot composed of approximately 150 strongly interacting Rydberg-dressed <sup>87</sup>Rb atoms in a cavity, and observe blockaded transport of photons through it. We further observe coherent photon tunnelling oscillations, demonstrating that the dot is zero-dimensional. This work establishes the cavity Rydberg polariton as a candidate qubit in a photonic information processor and, by employing multiple resonator modes as the spatial degrees of freedom of a photonic particle, the primary ingredient to form photonic quantum matter.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics and James Franck Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Ningyuan Jia', ',\xa0Nathan Schine', ',\xa0Alexandros Georgakopoulos', ',\xa0Albert Ryou', ',\xa0Logan W.

letter,Rotational spectroscopy of cold and trapped molecular ions in the Lamb–Dicke regime,"<p>Sympathetic cooling of trapped ions has been established as a powerful technique for the manipulation of non-laser-coolable ions. For molecular ions, it promises vastly enhanced spectroscopic resolution and accuracy. However, this potential remains untapped so far, with the best resolution achieved being not better than 5&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;8</sup> fractionally, due to residual Doppler broadening being present in ion clusters even at the lowest achievable translational temperatures. Here we introduce a general and accessible approach that enables Doppler-free rotational spectroscopy. It makes use of the strong radial spatial confinement of molecular ions when trapped and crystallized in a linear quadrupole trap, providing the Lamb&#8211;Dicke regime for rotational transitions. We achieve a linewidth of 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> fractionally and 1.3&#8201;kHz absolute, an improvement of &#8771;50-fold over the previous highest resolution in rotational spectroscopy. As an application, we demonstrate the most precise test of ab initio molecular theory and the most accurate (1.3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;9</sup>) determination of the proton mass using molecular spectroscopy. The results represent the long overdue extension of Doppler-free microwave spectroscopy of laser-cooled atomic ion clusters to higher spectroscopy frequencies and to molecules.

letter,Attosecond optical-field-enhanced carrier injection into the GaAs conduction band,"<p>Resolving the fundamental carrier dynamics induced in solids by strong electric fields is essential for future applications, ranging from nanoscale transistors to high-speed electro-optical switches. How fast and at what rate can electrons be injected into the conduction band of a solid? Here, we investigate the sub-femtosecond response of GaAs induced by resonant intense near-infrared laser pulses using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. In particular, we unravel the distinct role of intra- versus interband transitions. Surprisingly, we found that despite the resonant driving laser, the optical response during the light&#8211;matter interaction is dominated by intraband motion. Furthermore, we observed that the coupling between the two mechanisms results in a significant enhancement of the carrier injection from the valence into the conduction band. This is especially unexpected as the intraband mechanism itself can accelerate carriers only within the same band. This physical phenomenon could be used to control ultrafast carrier excitation and boost injection rates in electronic switches in the petahertz regime.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['F.

letter,Quantum Landauer erasure with a molecular nanomagnet,"<p>The erasure of a bit of information is an irreversible operation whose minimal entropy production of k<sub>B</sub>&#8201;ln&#8201;2 is set by the Landauer limit. This limit has been verified in a variety of classical systems, including particles in traps and nanomagnets. Here, we extend it to the quantum realm by using a crystal of molecular nanomagnets as a quantum spin memory and showing that its erasure is still governed by the Landauer principle. In contrast to classical systems, maximal energy efficiency is achieved while preserving fast operation owing to its high-speed spin dynamics. The performance of our spin register in terms of energy&#8211;time cost is orders of magnitude better than existing memory devices to date. The result shows that thermodynamics sets a limit on the energy cost of certain quantum operations and illustrates a way to enhance classical computations by using a quantum system.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands', 'authors': ['R.

letter,Doping-induced disappearance of ice II from water's phase diagram,"<p>Water and the many phases of ice display a plethora of complex physical properties and phase relationships that are of paramount importance in a range of settings including processes in Earth&#8217;s hydrosphere, the geology of icy moons, industry and even the evolution of life. Well-known examples include the unusual behaviour of supercooled water, the emergent ferroelectric ordering in ice films and the fact that the &#8216;ordinary&#8217; ice Ih floats on water. We report the intriguing observation that ice II, one of the high-pressure phases of ice, disappears in a selective fashion from water&#8217;s phase diagram following the addition of small amounts of ammonium fluoride. This finding exposes the strict topologically constrained nature of the ice II hydrogen-bond network, which is not found for the competing phases. In analogy to the behaviour of frustrated magnets, the presence of the exceptional ice II is argued to have a wider impact on water&#8217;s phase diagram, potentially explaining its general tendency to display anomalous behaviour. Furthermore, the impurity-induced disappearance of ice II raises the prospect that specific dopants may not only be able to suppress certain phases but also induce the formation of new phases of ice in future studies.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Chemistry, University College London, London, UK', 'authors': ['Jacob J.

article,Entanglement of purification through holographic duality,"<p>The gauge/gravity correspondence discovered two decades ago has had a profound influence on how the basic laws in physics should be formulated. In spite of the predictive power of holographic approaches (for example, when they are applied to strongly coupled condensed-matter physics problems), the fundamental reasons behind their success remain unclear. Recently, the role of quantum entanglement has come to the fore. Here we explore a quantity that connects gravity and quantum information in the light of the gauge/gravity correspondence. This is given by the minimal cross-section of the entanglement wedge that connects two disjoint subsystems in a gravity dual. In particular, we focus on various inequalities that are satisfied by this quantity. They suggest that it is a holographic counterpart of the quantity called entanglement of purification, which measures a bipartite correlation in a given mixed state. We give a heuristic argument that supports this identification based on a tensor network interpretation of holography. This predicts that the entanglement of purification satisfies the strong superadditivity for holographic conformal field theories.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics,  Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan', 'authors': ['Koji Umemoto', '\xa0&\xa0Tadashi Takayanagi']}, {'address': 'Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Japan', 'authors': ['Tadashi Takayanagi']}]",False,"['Koji Umemoto', 'Tadashi Takayanagi']","Umemoto, K., Takayanagi, T.

article,"Mutual information, neural networks and the renormalization group","<p>Physical systems differing in their microscopic details often display strikingly similar behaviour when probed at macroscopic scales. Those universal properties, largely determining their physical characteristics, are revealed by the powerful renormalization group (RG) procedure, which systematically retains &#8216;slow&#8217; degrees of freedom and integrates out the rest. However, the important degrees of freedom may be difficult to identify. Here we demonstrate a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying the relevant degrees of freedom and executing RG steps iteratively without any prior knowledge about the system. We introduce an artificial neural network based on a model-independent, information-theoretic characterization of a real-space RG procedure, which performs this task. We apply the algorithm to classical statistical physics problems in one and two dimensions. We demonstrate RG flow and extract the Ising critical exponent. Our results demonstrate that machine-learning techniques can extract abstract physical concepts and consequently become an integral part of theory- and model-building.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Maciej Koch-Janusz']}, {'address': 'Racah Institute of Physics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel', 'authors': ['Zohar Ringel']}]",False,"['Maciej Koch-Janusz', 'Zohar Ringel']","Koch-Janusz, M., Ringel, Z.

article,Multiscale unfolding of real networks by geometric renormalization,"<p>Symmetries in physical theories denote invariance under some transformation, such as self-similarity under a change of scale. The renormalization group provides a powerful framework to study these symmetries, leading to a better understanding of the universal properties of phase transitions. However, the small-world property of complex networks complicates application of the renormalization group by introducing correlations between coexisting scales. Here, we provide a framework for the investigation of complex networks at different resolutions. The approach is based on geometric representations, which have been shown to sustain network navigability and to reveal the mechanisms that govern network structure and evolution. We define a geometric renormalization group for networks by embedding them into an underlying hidden metric space. We find that real scale-free networks show geometric scaling under this renormalization group transformation. We unfold the networks in a self-similar multilayer shell that distinguishes the coexisting scales and their interactions. This in turn offers a basis for exploring critical phenomena and universality in complex networks. It also affords us immediate practical applications, including high-fidelity smaller-scale replicas of large networks and a multiscale navigation protocol in hyperbolic space, which betters those on single layers.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Departament de Física de la Matèria Condensada, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Guillermo García-Pérez', ',\xa0Marián Boguñá', '\xa0&\xa0M.

article,Characterizing quantum supremacy in near-term devices,"<p>A critical question for quantum computing in the near future is whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of supercomputers. Such a demonstration of what is referred to as quantum supremacy requires a reliable evaluation of the resources required to solve tasks with classical approaches. Here, we propose the task of sampling from the output distribution of random quantum circuits as a demonstration of quantum supremacy. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We introduce cross-entropy benchmarking to obtain the experimental fidelity of complex multiqubit dynamics. This can be estimated and extrapolated to give a success metric for a quantum supremacy demonstration. We study the computational cost of relevant classical algorithms and conclude that quantum supremacy can be achieved with circuits in a two-dimensional lattice of 7&#8201;&#215;&#8201;7 qubits and around 40 clock cycles. This requires an error rate of around 0.5% for two-qubit gates (0.05% for one-qubit gates), and it would demonstrate the basic building blocks for a fault-tolerant quantum computer.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Google Inc., Venice, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Sergio Boixo', ',\xa0Vadim N.

article,Bulk crystalline optomechanics,"<p>Control of long-lived, high-frequency phonons using light offers a path towards creating robust quantum links, and could lead to tools for precision metrology with applications to quantum information processing. Optomechanical systems based on bulk acoustic-wave resonators are well suited for this goal in light of their high quality factors, and because they do not suffer from surface interactions as much as their microscale counterparts. However, so far these phonons have been accessible only electromechanically, using piezoelectric interactions. Here, we demonstrate customizable optomechanical coupling to macroscopic phonon modes of a bulk acoustic-wave resonator at cryogenic temperatures. These phonon modes, which are formed by shaping the surfaces of a crystal into a plano-convex phononic resonator, yield appreciable optomechanical coupling rates, providing access to high acoustic quality factors (4.2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>7</sup>) at high phonon frequencies (13&#8201;GHz). This simple approach, which uses bulk properties rather than nanostructural control, is appealing for the ability to engineer optomechanical systems at high frequencies that are robust against thermal decoherence. Moreover, we show that this optomechanical system yields a unique form of dispersive symmetry-breaking that enables phonon heating or cooling without an optical cavity.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Applied Physics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA', 'authors': ['W.

article,Towards anti-causal Green's function for three-dimensional sub-diffraction focusing,"<p>In causal physics, the causal Green&#8217;s function describes the radiation of a point source. Its counterpart, the anti-causal Green&#8217;s function, depicts a spherically converging wave. However, in free space, any converging wave must be followed by a diverging one. Their interference gives rise to the diffraction limit that constrains the smallest possible dimension of a wave&#8217;s focal spot in free space, which is half the wavelength. Here, we show with three-dimensional acoustic experiments that we can realize a stand-alone anti-causal Green&#8217;s function in a large portion of space up to a subwavelength distance from the focus point by introducing a near-perfect absorber for spherical waves at the focus. We build this subwavelength absorber based on membrane-type acoustic metamaterial, and experimentally demonstrate focusing of spherical waves beyond the diffraction limit.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Advanced Study, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China', 'authors': ['Guancong Ma', ',\xa0Ping Sheng', '\xa0&\xa0Mathias Fink']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China', 'authors': ['Guancong Ma', ',\xa0Xiying Fan', ',\xa0Fuyin Ma', '\xa0&\xa0Ping Sheng']}, {'address': 'Institut Langevin, CNRS, ESPCI Paris, PSL Research University, Paris, France', 'authors': ['Julien de Rosny', '\xa0&\xa0Mathias Fink']}]",False,"['Guancong Ma', 'Xiying Fan', 'Fuyin Ma', 'Julien de Rosny', 'Ping Sheng', 'Mathias Fink']","Ma, G., Fan, X., Ma, F. et al.

article,Geometric constraints during epithelial jamming,"<p>As an injury heals, an embryo develops or a carcinoma spreads, epithelial cells systematically change their shape. In each of these processes cell shape is studied extensively whereas variability of shape from cell to cell is regarded most often as biological noise. But where do cell shape and its variability come from? Here we report that cell shape and shape variability are mutually constrained through a relationship that is purely geometrical. That relationship is shown to govern processes as diverse as maturation of the pseudostratified bronchial epithelial layer cultured from non-asthmatic or asthmatic donors, and formation of the ventral furrow in the Drosophila embryo. Across these and other epithelial systems, shape variability collapses to a family of distributions that is common to all. That distribution, in turn, is accounted for by a mechanistic theory of cell&#8211;cell interaction, showing that cell shape becomes progressively less elongated and less variable as the layer becomes progressively more jammed. These findings suggest a connection between jamming and geometry that spans living organisms and inert jammed systems, and thus transcends system details. Although molecular events are needed for any complete theory of cell shape and cell packing, observations point to the hypothesis that jamming behaviour at larger scales of organization sets overriding geometric constraints.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Harvard T.H.

article,Mitotic cells generate protrusive extracellular forces to divide in three-dimensional microenvironments,"<p>During mitosis, or cell division, mammalian cells undergo extensive morphological changes, including elongation along the mitotic axis, which is perpendicular to the plane that bisects the two divided cells. Although much is known about the intracellular dynamics of mitosis, it is unclear how cells are able to divide in tissues, where the changes required for mitosis are mechanically constrained by surrounding cells and extracellular matrix. Here, by confining cells three dimensionally in hydrogels, we show that dividing cells generate substantial protrusive forces that deform their surroundings along the mitotic axis, clearing space for mitotic elongation. When forces are insufficient to create space for mitotic elongation, mitosis fails. We identify one source of protrusive force as the elongation of the interpolar spindle, an assembly of microtubules aligned with the mitotic axis. Another source of protrusive force is shown to be contraction of the cytokinetic ring, the polymeric structure that cleaves a dividing cell at its equator, which drives expansion along the mitotic axis. These findings reveal key functions for the interpolar spindle and cytokinetic ring in protrusive extracellular force generation, and explain how dividing cells overcome mechanical constraints in confining microenvironments, including some types of tumour.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Sungmin Nam', '\xa0&\xa0Ovijit Chaudhuri']}]",False,"['Sungmin Nam', 'Ovijit Chaudhuri']","Nam, S., Chaudhuri, O.
