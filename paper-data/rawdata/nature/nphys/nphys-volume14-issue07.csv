review article,Physical biology of the cancer cell glycocalyx,"<p>The glycocalyx coating the outside of most cells is a polymer meshwork comprising proteins and complex sugar chains called glycans. From a physical perspective, the glycocalyx has long been considered a simple &#8216;slime&#8217; that protects cells from mechanical disruption or against pathogen interactions, but the great complexity of the structure argues for the evolution of more advanced functionality: the glycocalyx serves as the complex physical environment within which cell-surface receptors reside and operate. Recent studies have demonstrated that the glycocalyx can exert thermodynamic and kinetic control over cell signalling by serving as the local medium within which receptors diffuse, assemble and function. The composition and structure of the glycocalyx change markedly with changes in cell state, including transformation. Notably, cancer-specific changes fuel the synthesis of monomeric building blocks and machinery for production of long-chain polymers that alter the physical and chemical structure of the glycocalyx. In this Review, we discuss these changes and their physical consequences on receptor function and emergent cell behaviours.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA', 'authors': ['Joe Chin-Hun Kuo', ',\xa0Jay G.

review article,Mesoscale physical principles of collective cell organization,"<p>We review recent evidence showing that cell and tissue dynamics are governed by mesoscale physical principles. These principles can be understood in terms of simple state diagrams in which control variables include force, density, shape, adhesion and self-propulsion. An appropriate combination of these physical quantities gives rise to emergent phenomena such as cell jamming, topological defects and underdamped waves. Mesoscale physical properties of cell assemblies are found to precede and instruct biological functions such as cell division, extrusion, invasion and gradient sensing. These properties are related to properties of biomolecules, but cannot be predicted from biochemical principles. Thus, biological function is governed by emergent mesoscale states that can be predicted by a simple set of physical properties.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Xavier Trepat']}, {'address': 'Unitat de Biofísica i Bioenginyeria, Facultat de Medicina, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Xavier Trepat']}, {'address': 'Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Xavier Trepat']}, {'address': 'Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red en Bioingeniería, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Xavier Trepat']}, {'address': 'The Francis Crick Institute, London, UK', 'authors': ['Erik Sahai']}]",False,"['Xavier Trepat', 'Erik Sahai']","Trepat, X., Sahai, E.

review article,The physics of cooperative transport in groups of ants,"<p>Anyone who has moved furniture together with friends will appreciate that cooperative transport requires some non-trivial communication. Yet ants are adept at collectively moving objects several times their size. How they do so has long been a subject of research, but recent advances have suggested that this communication occurs through the forces the ants exert on the load. This implies that the collective transport problem can be mapped to an Ising model, in which decisions by individual ants are described by spin flips. Within this framework, the group is poised in the vicinity of the transition between uncoordinated and coordinated motion. It thus profits from both internal coordination and maximal responsiveness to external information, mediated by temporarily informed leader ants. Here, we review the implications of these findings for cooperative transport, and discuss the way in which a more complete multiscale understanding of such systems would require the development of a new formalism that combines statistical physics of interacting particles with the cognitive capabilities of individuals.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel', 'authors': ['Ofer Feinerman', ',\xa0Aviram Gelblum', '\xa0&\xa0Ehud Fonio']}, {'address': 'Departments of Biology and Physics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA', 'authors': ['Itai Pinkoviezky']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemical and Biological Physics, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel', 'authors': ['Nir S.

letter,Amplification of intense light fields by nearly free electrons,"<p>Light can be used to modify and control properties of media, as in the case of electromagnetically induced transparency or, more recently, for the generation of slow light or bright coherent extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. Particularly unusual states of matter can be created by light fields with strengths comparable to the Coulomb field that binds valence electrons in atoms, leading to nearly free electrons oscillating in the laser field and yet still loosely bound to the core. These are known as Kramers&#8211;Henneberger states, a specific example of laser-dressed states. Here, we demonstrate that these states arise not only in isolated atoms, but also in rare gases, at and above atmospheric pressure, where they can act as a gain medium during laser filamentation. Using shaped laser pulses, gain in these states is achieved within just a few cycles of the guided field. The corresponding lasing emission is a signature of population inversion in these states and of their stability against ionization. Our work demonstrates that these unusual states of neutral atoms can be exploited to create a general ultrafast gain mechanism during laser filamentation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'GAP, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Mary Matthews', ',\xa0Julien Gateau', ',\xa0Nicolas Berti', ',\xa0Sylvain Hermelin', ',\xa0Jérôme Kasparian', '\xa0&\xa0Jean-Pierre Wolf']}, {'address': 'Max-Born-Institut für Nichtlineare Optik und Kurzzeitspektroskopie, Berlin, Germany', 'authors': ['Felipe Morales', ',\xa0Maria Richter', ',\xa0Timm Bredtmann', ',\xa0Olga Smirnova', '\xa0&\xa0Misha Ivanov']}, {'address': 'Inst. für Exp.

letter,Ultrafast preparation and detection of ring currents in single atoms,"<p>Quantum particles can penetrate potential barriers by tunnelling. If that barrier is rotating, the tunnelling process is modified. This is typical for electrons in atoms, molecules or solids exposed to strong circularly polarized laser pulses. Here we measure how the transmission probability through a rotating tunnel depends on the sign of the magnetic quantum number m of the electron and thus on the initial direction of rotation of its quantum phase. We further show that our findings agree with a semiclassical picture, in which the electron keeps part of that rotary motion on its way through the tunnel by measuring m-dependent modification of the electron emission pattern. These findings are relevant for attosecond metrology as well as for interpretation of strong-field electron emission from atoms and molecules and directly demonstrate the creation of ring currents in bound states of ions with attosecond precision. In solids, this could open a way to inducing and controlling ring-current-related topological phenomena.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut für Kernphysik, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany', 'authors': ['Sebastian Eckart', ',\xa0Maksim Kunitski', ',\xa0Martin Richter', ',\xa0Alexander Hartung', ',\xa0Jonas Rist', ',\xa0Florian Trinter', ',\xa0Kilian Fehre', ',\xa0Nikolai Schlott', ',\xa0Kevin Henrichs', ',\xa0Lothar Ph.

letter,On-demand quantum state transfer and entanglement between remote microwave cavity memories,"<p>Coupling isolated quantum systems through propagating photons is a central theme in quantum science, with the potential for groundbreaking applications such as distributed, fault-tolerant quantum computing. To date, photons have been used widely to realize high-fidelity remote entanglement and state transfer by compensating for inefficiency with conditioning, a fundamentally probabilistic strategy that places limits on the rate of communication. In contrast, here we experimentally realize a long-standing proposal for deterministic, direct quantum state transfer. Using efficient, parametrically controlled emission and absorption of microwave photons, we show on-demand, high-fidelity state transfer and entanglement between two isolated superconducting cavity quantum memories. The transfer rate is faster than the rate of photon loss in either memory, an essential requirement for complex networks. By transferring states in a multiphoton encoding, we further show that the use of cavity memories and state-independent transfer creates the striking opportunity to deterministically mitigate transmission loss with quantum error correction. Our results establish a compelling approach for deterministic quantum communication across networks, and will enable modular scaling of superconducting quantum circuits.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Departments of Applied Physics and Physics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA', 'authors': ['Christopher J.

letter,Experimental signatures of emergent quantum electrodynamics in Pr2Hf2O7,"<p>In a quantum spin liquid, the magnetic moments of the constituent electron spins evade classical long-range order to form an exotic state that is quantum entangled and coherent over macroscopic length scales. Such phases offer promising perspectives for device applications in quantum information technologies, and their study can reveal new physics in quantum matter. Quantum spin ice is an appealing proposal of one such state, in which the fundamental ground state properties and excitations are described by an emergent U(1) lattice gauge theory. This quantum-coherent regime has quasiparticles that are predicted to behave like magnetic and electric monopoles, along with a gauge boson playing the role of an artificial photon. However, this emergent lattice quantum electrodynamics has proved elusive in experiments. Here we report neutron scattering measurements of the rare-earth pyrochlore magnet Pr<sub>2</sub>Hf<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> that provide evidence for a quantum spin ice ground state. We find a quasi-elastic structure factor with pinch points&#8212;a signature of a classical spin ice&#8212;that are partially suppressed, as expected in the quantum-coherent regime of the lattice field theory at finite temperature. Our result allows an estimate for the speed of light associated with magnetic photon excitations. We also reveal a continuum of inelastic spin excitations, which resemble predictions for the fractionalized, topological excitations of a quantum spin ice. Taken together, these two signatures suggest that the low-energy physics of Pr<sub>2</sub>Hf<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> can be described by emergent quantum electrodynamics. If confirmed, the observation of a quantum spin ice ground state would constitute a concrete example of a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid&#8212;a topical state of matter that has so far mostly been explored in lower dimensionalities.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratory for Neutron Scattering and Imaging, Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Romain Sibille', ',\xa0Michel Kenzelmann', '\xa0&\xa0Tom Fennell']}, {'address': 'Laboratory for Scientific Developments and Novel Materials, Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Romain Sibille', ',\xa0Nicolas Gauthier', ',\xa0Uwe Filges', '\xa0&\xa0Michel Kenzelmann']}, {'address': 'Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Onna-son, Okinawa, Japan', 'authors': ['Han Yan', '\xa0&\xa0Nic Shannon']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK', 'authors': ['Monica Ciomaga Hatnean', '\xa0&\xa0Geetha Balakrishnan']}, {'address': 'Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France', 'authors': ['Jacques Ollivier']}, {'address': 'Neutron Scattering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA', 'authors': ['Barry Winn']}]",False,"['Romain Sibille', 'Nicolas Gauthier', 'Han Yan', 'Monica Ciomaga Hatnean', 'Jacques Ollivier', 'Barry Winn', 'Uwe Filges', 'Geetha Balakrishnan', 'Michel Kenzelmann', 'Nic Shannon', 'Tom Fennell']","Sibille, R., Gauthier, N., Yan, H. et al.

letter,Topological quantum phase transition in the Ising-like antiferromagnetic spin chain BaCo2V2O8,"<p>Since the seminal ideas of Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless, topological excitations have been at the heart of our understanding of a whole novel class of phase transitions. In most cases, those transitions are controlled by a single type of topological objects. There are, however, some situations, still poorly understood, where two dual topological excitations fight to control the phase diagram and the transition. Finding experimental realizations of such cases is thus of considerable interest. We show here that this situation occurs in BaCo<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, a spin-1/2 Ising-like quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet, when subjected to a uniform magnetic field transverse to the Ising axis. Using neutron scattering experiments, we measure a drastic modification of the quantum excitations beyond a critical value of the magnetic field. This quantum phase transition is identified, through a comparison with theoretical calculations, to be a transition between two different types of solitonic topological object, which are captured by different components of the dynamical structure factor.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Univ.

letter,Classical topological order in the kinetics of artificial spin ice,"<p>Systems of interacting nanomagnets known as artificial spin ice have allowed the design, realization and study of geometrically frustrated exotic collective states that are absent in natural magnets. We have experimentally measured the thermally induced moment fluctuations in the Shakti geometry of artificial spin ice. We show that its disordered moment configuration is a topological phase described by an emergent dimer-cover model with excitations that can be characterized as topologically charged defects. Examination of the low-energy dynamics of the system confirms that these effective topological charges have long lifetimes associated with their topological protection, that is, they can be created and annihilated only as charge pairs with opposite sign and are kinetically constrained. This manifestation of classical topological order demonstrates that geometrical design in nanomagnetic systems can lead to emergent, topologically protected kinetics that can limit pathways to equilibration and ergodicity.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Yuyang Lao', ',\xa0Mohammed Sheikh', ',\xa0Joseph Sklenar', ',\xa0Daniel Gardeazabal', ',\xa0Karin Dahmen', '\xa0&\xa0Peter Schiffer']}, {'address': 'Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Yuyang Lao', ',\xa0Joseph Sklenar', ',\xa0Daniel Gardeazabal', '\xa0&\xa0Peter Schiffer']}, {'address': 'Theoretical Division, Institute for Materials Science, and Center for Nonlinear Studies, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA', 'authors': ['Francesco Caravelli', '\xa0&\xa0Cristiano Nisoli']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA', 'authors': ['Justin D.

letter,Spontaneous shear flow in confined cellular nematics,"<p>In embryonic development or tumour evolution, cells often migrate collectively within confining tracks defined by their microenvironment. In some of these situations, the displacements within a cell strand are antiparallel, giving rise to shear flows. However, the mechanisms underlying these spontaneous flows remain poorly understood. Here, we show that an ensemble of spindle-shaped cells plated in a well-defined stripe spontaneously develops a shear flow whose characteristics depend on the width of the stripe. On wide stripes, the cells self-organize in a nematic phase with a director at a well-defined angle with the stripe&#8217;s direction, and develop a shear flow close to the stripe&#8217;s edges. However, on stripes narrower than a critical width, the cells perfectly align with the stripe&#8217;s direction and the net flow vanishes. A hydrodynamic active gel theory provides an understanding of these observations and identifies the transition between the non-flowing phase oriented along the stripe and the tilted phase exhibiting shear flow as a Fr&#233;edericksz transition driven by the activity of the cells. This physical theory is grounded in the active nature of the cells and based on symmetries and conservation laws, providing a generic mechanism to interpret in vivo antiparallel cell displacements.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire PhysicoChimie Curie, Institut Curie, PSL Research University - Sorbonne Universités, UPMC – CNRS, Equipe Labellisée Ligue Contre le Cancer, Paris, France', 'authors': ['G.

article,Attosecond coupled electron and nuclear dynamics in dissociative ionization of H2,"<p>The interaction of an extreme-ultraviolet attosecond pulse with a molecular system suddenly removes electrons, which can lead to significant changes in the chemical bonding and hence to rearrangements of the residual molecular cation. The timescales of the electronic and nuclear dynamics are usually very different, thus supporting separate treatment. However, when light nuclei are involved, as in most organic and biological molecules containing atomic hydrogen, the correlation between electronic and nuclear motion cannot be ignored. Using an advanced attosecond pump&#8211;probe spectroscopic method, we show that the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion in H<sub>2</sub> leaves a clear trace in the phase of the entangled electron&#8211;nuclear wave packet. This requires us to re-evaluate the physical meaning of the measured phase, which depends on the energy distribution between electrons and nuclei. The conclusions are supported by ab initio calculations that explicitly account for the coupling between electronic and nuclear dynamics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics Department, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['L.

article,Bose–Einstein condensation in a plasmonic lattice,"<p>Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation is a remarkable manifestation of quantum statistics and macroscopic quantum coherence. Superconductivity and superfluidity have their origin in Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation. Ultracold quantum gases have provided condensates close to the original ideas of Bose and Einstein, while condensation of polaritons and magnons has introduced novel concepts of non-equilibrium condensation. Here, we demonstrate a Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate of surface plasmon polaritons in lattice modes of a metal nanoparticle array. Interaction of the nanoscale-confined surface plasmons with a room-temperature bath of dye molecules enables thermalization and condensation in picoseconds. The ultrafast thermalization and condensation dynamics are revealed by an experiment that exploits thermalization under propagation and the open-cavity character of the system. A crossover from a Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate to usual lasing is realized by tailoring the band structure.

article,Weak ergodicity breaking from quantum many-body scars,"<p>The thermodynamic description of many-particle systems rests on the assumption of ergodicity, the ability of a system to explore all allowed configurations in the phase space. Recent studies on many-body localization have revealed the existence of systems that strongly violate ergodicity in the presence of quenched disorder. Here, we demonstrate that ergodicity can be weakly broken by a different mechanism, arising from the presence of special eigenstates in the many-body spectrum that are reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic non-interacting systems. In the single-particle case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum but lead to direct experimental signatures, as we show for periodic recurrences that reproduce those observed in the experiment. Our results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, opening up opportunities for the creation of novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now experimentally realizable.</p>",,"[{'address': 'School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK', 'authors': ['C.

article,Dynamic force patterns promote collective cell movements during embryonic wound repair,"<p>Embryonic wounds heal rapidly, in a process driven by coordinated cell movements. Polarization of actin and the molecular motor non-muscle myosin II in the cells adjacent to the wound results in the formation of a supracellular cable around the wound that drives repair. In Drosophila embryos, the distribution of actin around wounds is heterogeneous, with regions of high and low actin density, and actin heterogeneity is necessary for rapid repair. Here, we demonstrate that actin and myosin display stochastic patterns around embryonic wounds, and that contractile forces around wounds are heterogeneous. Mathematical modelling suggests that actomyosin heterogeneity favours wound closure if myosin is regulated by tension and strain, a hypothesis that we validate experimentally. We show that inhibition of stretch-activated ion channels disrupts myosin dynamics and tissue repair. Together, our results indicate that staggered contractile events, mechanical signals and force-regulated myosin dynamics coordinate cell behaviours to drive efficient wound closure.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Teresa Zulueta-Coarasa', '\xa0&\xa0Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalez']}, {'address': 'Translational Biology and Engineering Program, Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Teresa Zulueta-Coarasa', '\xa0&\xa0Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalez']}, {'address': 'Department of Cell and Systems Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalez']}, {'address': 'Developmental and Stem Cell Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalez']}]",False,"['Teresa Zulueta-Coarasa', 'Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalez']","Zulueta-Coarasa, T., Fernandez-Gonzalez, R.

article,Aeolian sand sorting and megaripple formation,"<p>Sand is blown across beaches and deserts by turbulent winds. This seemingly chaotic process creates two dominant bedforms: decametre-scale dunes and centimetre-scale ripples, but hardly anything in between. By the very same process, grains are constantly sorted. Smaller grains advance faster, while heavier grains trail behind. Here, we argue that, under erosive conditions, sand sorting and structure formation can conspire to create distinct bedforms in the &#8216;forbidden wavelength gap&#8217; between aeolian ripples and dunes. These so-called megaripples are shown to co-evolve with an unusual, predominantly bimodal grain-size distribution. Combining theory and field measurements, we develop a mechanistic understanding of their formation, shape and migration, as well as their cyclic ageing, renewal and sedimentary memory, in terms of the intermittent wind statistics.
