letter,Observation of Feshbach resonances between alkali and closed-shell atoms,"<p>Magnetic Feshbach resonances allow control of the interactions between ultracold atoms. They are an invaluable tool in studies of few-body and many-body physics, and can be used to convert pairs of atoms into molecules by ramping an applied magnetic field across a resonance. Molecules formed from pairs of alkali atoms have been transferred to low-lying states, producing dipolar quantum gases. There is great interest in making molecules formed from an alkali atom and a closed-shell atom such as ground-state Sr or Yb. Such molecules have both a strong electric dipole and an electron spin; they will open up new possibilities for designing quantum many-body systems, and for tests of fundamental symmetries. The crucial first step is to observe Feshbach resonances in the corresponding atomic mixtures. Very narrow resonances have been predicted theoretically, but until now have eluded observation. Here we present the observation of magnetic Feshbach resonances of this type, for an alkali atom, Rb, interacting with ground-state Sr.</p>",[],False,"[""Vincent Barb\u00e9"", ""Alessio Ciamei"", ""Benjamin Pasquiou"", ""Lukas Reichs\u00f6llner"", ""Florian Schreck"", ""Piotr S. \u017buchowski"", ""Jeremy M.

letter,Strong coupling between photons of two light fields mediated by one atom,"<p>All-optical sensing of the number of photons in one light field with another light field is a longstanding goal with intriguing prospects for various quantum applications. A suitable system must be capable of strongly coupling individual photons of the two fields. Here we report on the realization of such a system for two fields at wavelengths 780&#8201;nm and 795&#8201;nm. These fields drive two modes of an optical cavity, each strongly coupled to separate transitions of a single rubidium atom. An additional control laser addresses the atom and induces a tunable coupling between the modes, resulting in a doubly nonlinear energy-level structure of the photon&#8211;photon&#8211;atom system. We observe strong correlations between the light fields, with photons either mutually blocking each other or transiting the system conjunctly, and demonstrate all-optical switching at the single-photon level as a first application. In this new setting of strongly coupled light fields, nondestructive counting of photons with photons and heralded n-photon sources might be within reach.</p>",[],False,"[""Christoph Hamsen"", ""Karl Nicolas Tolazzi"", ""Tatjana Wilk"", ""Gerhard Rempe""]","Hamsen, C., Tolazzi, K.N., Wilk, T. et al.

letter,Laser cooling of optically trapped molecules,"<p>Ultracold molecules are ideal platforms for many important applications, ranging from quantum simulation and quantum information processing  to precision tests of fundamental physics. Producing trapped, dense samples of ultracold molecules is a challenging task. One promising approach is direct laser cooling, which can be applied to several classes of molecules not easily assembled from ultracold atoms. Here, we report the production of trapped samples of laser-cooled CaF molecules with densities of 8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>7</sup> cm<sup>&#8722;3</sup> and at phase-space densities of 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;9</sup>, 35 times higher than for sub-Doppler-cooled samples in free space. These advances are made possible by efficient laser cooling of optically trapped molecules to well below the Doppler limit, a key step towards many future applications. These range from ultracold chemistry to quantum simulation, where conservative trapping of cold and dense samples is desirable. In addition, the ability to cool optically trapped molecules opens up new paths towards quantum degeneracy.</p>",[],False,"[""Lo\u00efc Anderegg"", ""Benjamin L.

letter,Maximal spontaneous photon emission and energy loss from free electrons,"<p>Free-electron radiation such as Cerenkov, Smith&#8211;Purcell and transition radiation can be greatly affected by structured optical environments, as has been demonstrated in a variety of polaritonic, photonic-crystal and metamaterial systems. However, the amount of radiation that can ultimately be extracted from free electrons near an arbitrary material structure has remained elusive. Here we derive a fundamental upper limit to the spontaneous photon emission and energy loss of free electrons, regardless of geometry, which illuminates the effects of material properties and electron velocities. We obtain experimental evidence for our theory with quantitative measurements of Smith&#8211;Purcell radiation. Our framework allows us to make two predictions. One is a new regime of radiation operation&#8212;at subwavelength separations, slower (non-relativistic) electrons can achieve stronger radiation than fast (relativistic) electrons. The other is a divergence of the emission probability in the limit of lossless materials. We further reveal that such divergences can be approached by coupling free electrons to photonic bound states in the continuum. Our findings suggest that compact and efficient free-electron radiation sources from microwaves to the soft X-ray regime may be achievable without requiring ultrahigh accelerating voltages.</p>",[],False,"[""Yi Yang"", ""Aviram Massuda"", ""Charles Roques-Carmes"", ""Steven E.

letter,Electrically switchable Berry curvature dipole in the monolayer topological insulator WTe2,"<p>Recent experimental evidence for the quantum spin Hall (QSH) state in monolayer WTe<sub>2</sub> has linked the fields of two-dimensional materials and topological physics. This two-dimensional topological crystal also displays unconventional spin&#8211;torque and gate-tunable superconductivity. Whereas the realization of the QSH has demonstrated the nontrivial topology of the electron wavefunctions of monolayer WTe<sub>2</sub>, the geometrical properties of the wavefunction, such as the Berry curvature, remain unstudied. Here we utilize mid-infrared optoelectronic microscopy to investigate the Berry curvature in monolayer WTe<sub>2</sub>. By optically exciting electrons across the inverted QSH gap, we observe an in-plane circular photogalvanic current even under normal incidence. The application of an out-of-plane displacement field allows further control of the direction and magnitude of the photocurrent. The observed photocurrent reveals a Berry curvature dipole that arises from the nontrivial wavefunctions near the inverted gap edge. The Berry curvature dipole and strong electric field effect are enabled by the inverted band structure and tilted crystal lattice of monolayer WTe<sub>2</sub>. Such an electrically switchable Berry curvature dipole may facilitate the observation of a wide range of quantum geometrical phenomena such as the quantum nonlinear Hall, orbital-Edelstein and chiral polaritonic effects.</p>",[],False,"[""Su-Yang Xu"", ""Qiong Ma"", ""Huitao Shen"", ""Valla Fatemi"", ""Sanfeng Wu"", ""Tay-Rong Chang"", ""Guoqing Chang"", ""Andr\u00e9s M.

letter,Long-distance spin transport through a graphene quantum Hall antiferromagnet,"<p>Because of their ultrafast intrinsic dynamics and robustness against stray fields, antiferromagnetic insulators are promising candidates for spintronic components. Therefore, long-distance, low-dissipation spin transport and electrical manipulation of antiferromagnetic order are key research goals in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we report experimental evidence of robust spin transport through an antiferromagnetic insulator, in our case the gate-controlled state that appears in charge-neutral graphene in a magnetic field. Utilizing quantum Hall edge states as spin-dependent injectors and detectors, we observe large, non-local electrical signals across charge-neutral channels that are up to 5&#8201;&#956;m long. The dependence of the signal on magnetic field, temperature and filling factor is consistent with spin superfluidity as the spin-transport mechanism.

letter,Pair-breaking quantum phase transition in superconducting nanowires,"<p>Quantum phase transitions (QPT) between distinct ground states of matter are widespread phenomena, yet there are only a few experimentally accessible systems where the microscopic mechanism of the transition can be tested and understood. These cases are unique and form the experimentally established foundation for our understanding of quantum critical phenomena. Here we report that a magnetic-field-driven QPT in superconducting nanowires&#8212;a prototypical one-dimensional system (d=1)&#8212;can be fully explained by the critical theory of pair-breaking transitions characterized by a correlation length exponent v&#8776;1 and dynamic critical exponent z&#8776;2. We find that in the quantum critical regime, the electrical conductivity is in agreement with a theoretically predicted scaling function and, moreover, that the theory quantitatively describes the dependence of conductivity on the critical temperature, field magnitude and orientation, nanowire cross-sectional area, and microscopic parameters of the nanowire material. At the critical field, the conductivity follows a T<sup>(d&#8211;2)/z</sup> dependence predicted by phenomenological scaling theories and more recently obtained within a holographic framework. Our work uncovers the microscopic processes governing the transition: the pair-breaking effect of the magnetic field on interacting Cooper pairs overdamped by their coupling to electronic degrees of freedom.

article,Higher-order topology in bismuth,"<p>The mathematical field of topology has become a framework in which to describe the low-energy electronic structure of crystalline solids. Typical of a bulk insulating three-dimensional topological crystal are conducting two-dimensional surface states. This constitutes the topological bulk&#8211;boundary correspondence. Here, we establish that the electronic structure of bismuth, an element consistently described as bulk topologically trivial, is in fact topological and follows a generalized bulk&#8211;boundary correspondence of higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal. We support our claim theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis is based on symmetry arguments, topological indices, first-principles calculations, and the recently introduced framework of topological quantum chemistry. We provide supporting evidence from two complementary experimental techniques. With scanning-tunnelling spectroscopy, we probe the signatures of the rotational symmetry of the one-dimensional states located at the step edges of the crystal surface. With Josephson interferometry, we demonstrate their universal topological contribution to the electronic transport.

article,Topolectrical-circuit realization of topological corner modes,"<p>Quantized electric quadrupole insulators have recently been proposed as novel quantum states of matter in two spatial dimensions. Gapped otherwise, they can feature zero-dimensional topological corner mid-gap states protected by the bulk spectral gap, reflection symmetries and a spectral symmetry. Here we introduce a topolectrical circuit design for realizing such corner modes experimentally and report measurements in which the modes appear as topological boundary resonances in the corner impedance profile of the circuit. Whereas the quantized bulk quadrupole moment of an electronic crystal does not have a direct analogue in the classical topolectrical-circuit framework, the corner modes inherit the identical form from the quantum case. Due to the flexibility and tunability of electrical circuits, they are an ideal platform for studying the reflection symmetry-protected character of corner modes in detail. Our work therefore establishes an instance where topolectrical circuitry is employed to bridge the gap between quantum theoretical modelling and the experimental realization of topological band structures.</p>",[],False,"[""Stefan Imhof"", ""Christian Berger"", ""Florian Bayer"", ""Johannes Brehm"", ""Laurens W.

article,Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states at an isospin transition in monolayer graphene,"<p>In monolayer graphene, the two inequivalent sublattices of carbon atoms combine with the electron spin to give electrons a nearly fourfold degenerate internal isospin. At high magnetic fields, the isospin degeneracy increases the already large intrinsic degeneracy of the two-dimensional Landau levels, making low-disorder graphene systems a versatile platform for studying multicomponent quantum magnetism. Here, we describe magnetocapacitance experiments of ultraclean monolayer graphene devices in which a hexagonal boron nitride substrate breaks the symmetry between carbon sublattices. We observe a phase transition in the isospin system, which is marked by unusual transitions in odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall states for filling factors &#957; near charge neutrality and by the unexpected appearance of incompressible even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states at &#957;&#8201;=&#8201;&#177;1/2 and &#957;&#8201;=&#8201;&#177;1/4. We propose a scenario in which the observed states are multicomponent fractional quantum Hall states incorporating correlations between electrons on different carbon sublattices, associated with a quantum Hall analogue of the N&#233;el-to-valence bond solid transition that occurs at charge neutrality.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Observation of two independent skyrmion phases in a chiral magnetic material,"<p>Magnetic materials can host skyrmions, which are topologically non-trivial spin textures. In chiral magnets with cubic lattice symmetry, all previously observed skyrmion phases require thermal fluctuations to become thermodynamically stable in bulk materials, and therefore exist only at relatively high temperature, close to the helimagnetic transition temperature. Other stabilization mechanisms require a lowering of the cubic crystal symmetry. Here, we report the identification of a second skyrmion phase in Cu<sub>2</sub>OSeO<sub>3</sub> at low temperature and in the presence of an applied magnetic field. The new skyrmion phase is thermodynamically disconnected from the well-known, nearly isotropic, high-temperature phase, and exists, in contrast, when the external magnetic field is oriented along the &#12296;100&#12297; crystal axis only. Theoretical modelling provides evidence that the stabilization mechanism is given by well-known cubic anisotropy terms, and accounts for an additional observation of metastable helices tilted away from the applied field. The identification of two distinct skyrmion phases in the same material and the generic character of the underlying mechanism suggest a new avenue for the discovery, design and manipulation of topological spin textures.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Constant-pressure sound waves in non-Hermitian disordered media,"<p>When waves impinge on a disordered material they are back-scattered and form a highly complex interference pattern. Suppressing any such distortions of a wave&#8217;s free propagation is a challenging task with many applications in a number of different disciplines. In a recent theoretical proposal, it was pointed out that both perfect transmission through disorder as well as a complete suppression of any variation in a wave&#8217;s intensity can be achieved by adding a continuous gain&#8211;loss distribution to the disorder. Here we propose a practical discretized version of this abstract concept and implement it in a realistic acoustic system. Our prototype consists of an acoustic waveguide containing several inclusions that scatter the incoming wave in a passive configuration and provide the gain or loss when being actively controlled. Our measurements on this non-Hermitian acoustic metamaterial demonstrate the creation of a reflectionless scattering wave state that features a unique form of discrete constant-amplitude pressure waves. In addition to demonstrating that gain&#8211;loss additions can turn localized systems into transparent ones, we expect our proof-of-principle demonstration to trigger interesting new developments, not only in sound engineering, but also in other related fields such as in non-Hermitian photonics.</p>",[],False,"[""Etienne Rivet"", ""Andre Brandst\u00f6tter"", ""Konstantinos G.

article,Topography-driven surface renewal,"<p>Natural surfaces excel in self-renewal and preventing bio-fouling, while synthetic materials placed in contact with complex fluids quickly foul. We present a novel biophysics-inspired mechanism for surface renewal using actuating surface topography, generated by wrinkling. We calculate a critical surface curvature, given by an intrinsic characteristic length scale of the fouling layer that accounts for its effective flexural or bending stiffness and adhesion energy, beyond which surface renewal occurs. The effective bending stiffness includes the elasticity and thickness of the fouling patch, but also the boundary layer depth of the imposed wrinkled topography. The analytical scaling laws are validated using finite-element simulations and physical experiments. Our data span over five orders of magnitude in critical curvatures and are well normalized by the analytically calculated scaling. Moreover, our numerics suggests an energy-release mechanism whereby stored elastic energy in the fouling layer drives surface renewal. The strategy is broadly applicable to any surface with tunable topography and fouling layers with elastic response.</p>",[],False,"[""Luka Pocivavsek"", ""Joseph Pugar"", ""Robert O\u2019Dea"", ""Sang-Ho Ye"", ""William Wagner"", ""Edith Tzeng"", ""Sachin Velankar"", ""Enrique Cerda""]","Pocivavsek, L., Pugar, J., O’Dea, R. et al.

article,Verticalization of bacterial biofilms,"<p>Biofilms are communities of bacteria adhered to surfaces. Recently, biofilms of rod-shaped bacteria were observed at single-cell resolution and shown to develop from a disordered, two-dimensional layer of founder cells into a three-dimensional structure with a vertically aligned core. Here, we elucidate the physical mechanism underpinning this transition using a combination of agent-based and continuum modelling. We find that verticalization proceeds through a series of localized mechanical instabilities on the cellular scale. For short cells, these instabilities are primarily triggered by cell division, whereas long cells are more likely to be peeled off the surface by nearby vertical cells, creating an &#8216;inverse domino effect&#8217;. The interplay between cell growth and cell verticalization gives rise to an exotic mechanical state in which the effective surface pressure becomes constant throughout the growing core of the biofilm surface layer. This dynamical isobaricity determines the expansion speed of a biofilm cluster and thereby governs how cells access the third dimension. In particular, theory predicts that a longer average cell length yields more rapidly expanding, flatter biofilms. We experimentally show that such changes in biofilm development occur by exploiting chemicals that modulate cell length.</p>",[],False,"[""Farzan Beroz"", ""Jing Yan"", ""Yigal Meir"", ""Benedikt Sabass"", ""Howard A.

article,Neutrino interferometry for high-precision tests of Lorentz symmetry with IceCube,"<p>Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental spacetime symmetry underlying both the standard model of particle physics and general relativity. This symmetry guarantees that physical phenomena are observed to be the same by all inertial observers. However, unified theories, such as string theory, allow for violation of this symmetry by inducing new spacetime structure at the quantum gravity scale. Thus, the discovery of Lorentz symmetry violation could be the first hint of these theories in nature. Here we report the results of the most precise test of spacetime symmetry in the neutrino sector to date. We use high-energy atmospheric neutrinos observed at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for anomalous neutrino oscillations as signals of Lorentz violation. We find no evidence for such phenomena. This allows us to constrain the size of the dimension-four operator in the standard-model extension for Lorentz violation to the \(10^{-28}\) level and to set limits on higher-dimensional operators in this framework. These are among the most stringent limits on Lorentz violation set by any physical experiment.</p>",[],False,"[""M. G. Aartsen"", ""G. C. Hill"", ""A. Kyriacou"", ""S. Robertson"", ""A.
