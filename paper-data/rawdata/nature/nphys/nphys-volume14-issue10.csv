letter,Tunable photonic heat transport in a quantum heat valve,"<p>Quantum thermodynamics is emerging both as a topic of fundamental research and as a means to understand and potentially improve the performance of quantum devices. A prominent platform for achieving the necessary manipulation of quantum states is superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this platform, thermalization of a quantum system can be achieved by interfacing the circuit QED subsystem with a thermal reservoir of appropriate Hilbert dimensionality. Here we study heat transport through an assembly consisting of a superconducting qubit capacitively coupled between two nominally identical coplanar waveguide resonators, each equipped with a heat reservoir in the form of a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor termination. We report the observation of tunable photonic heat transport through the resonator&#8211;qubit&#8211;resonator assembly, showing that the reservoir-to-reservoir heat flux depends on the interplay between the qubit&#8211;resonator and the resonator&#8211;reservoir couplings, yielding qualitatively dissimilar results in different coupling regimes. Our quantum heat valve is relevant for the realization of quantum heat engines and refrigerators, which can be obtained, for example, by exploiting the time-domain dynamics and coherence of driven superconducting qubits. This effort would ultimately bridge the gap between the fields of quantum information and thermodynamics of mesoscopic systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Alberto Ronzani"", ""Bayan Karimi"", ""Jorden Senior"", ""Yu-Cheng Chang"", ""Joonas T.

letter,A passive photon–atom qubit swap operation,"<p>Deterministic quantum interactions between single photons and single quantum emitters are a vital building block towards the distribution of quantum information between remote systems. Deterministic photon&#8211;atom state transfer has previously been demonstrated with protocols that include active feedback or synchronized control pulses. Here we demonstrate a passive swap operation between the states of a single photon and a single atom. The underlying mechanism is single-photon Raman interaction&#8212;an interference-based scheme that leads to deterministic interaction between two photonic modes and the two ground states of a &#923;-system. Using a nanofibre-coupled microsphere resonator coupled to single Rb atoms, we swap a photonic qubit into the atom and back, demonstrating fidelities exceeding the classical threshold of 2/3 in both directions. In this simultaneous write and read process, the returning photon, which carries the readout of the atomic qubit, also heralds the successful arrival of the write photon. Requiring no control fields, this single-step gate takes place automatically at the timescale of the atom&#8217;s cavity-enhanced spontaneous emission. Applicable to any waveguide-coupled &#923;-system, this mechanism, which can also be harnessed to construct universal gates, provides a versatile building block for the modular scaling up of quantum information systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Orel Bechler"", ""Adrien Borne"", ""Serge Rosenblum"", ""Gabriel Guendelman"", ""Ori Ezrah Mor"", ""Moran Netser"", ""Tal Ohana"", ""Ziv Aqua"", ""Niv Drucker"", ""Ran Finkelstein"", ""Yulia Lovsky"", ""Rachel Bruch"", ""Doron Gurovich"", ""Ehud Shafir"", ""Barak Dayan""]","Bechler, O., Borne, A., Rosenblum, S. et al.A passive photon–atom qubit swap operation.

letter,Superlight inverse Doppler effect,"<p>It has long been thought that the inverse Doppler frequency shift of light is impossible in homogeneous systems with a positive refractive index. Here we break this long-held tenet by predicting a previously unconsidered Doppler effect of light inside a radiation cone, the so-called Vavilov&#8211;Cherenkov cone, under specific circumstances. It has been known from the classic work of Ginzburg and Frank that a superlight (that is, superluminal) normal Doppler effect appears inside the Vavilov&#8211;Cherenkov cone if the velocity of the source v is larger than the phase velocity of light v<sub>p</sub>. By further developing their theory, we discover that an inverse Doppler frequency shift will arise if v&#8201;&gt;&#8201;2v<sub>p</sub>. We denote this as the superlight inverse Doppler effect. Moreover, we show that the superlight inverse Doppler effect can be spatially separated from the other Doppler effects by using highly squeezed polaritons (such as graphene plasmons), which may facilitate the experimental observation.</p>",[],False,"[""Xihang Shi"", ""Xiao Lin"", ""Ido Kaminer"", ""Fei Gao"", ""Zhaoju Yang"", ""John D.

letter,Enhanced high-harmonic generation from an all-dielectric metasurface,"<p>The recent observation of high-harmonic generation from solids creates a new possibility for engineering fundamental strong-field processes by patterning the solid target with subwavelength nanostructures. All-dielectric metasurfaces exhibit high damage thresholds and strong enhancement of the driving field, making them attractive platforms to control high harmonics and other high-field processes at the nanoscale. Here we report enhanced non-perturbative high-harmonic emission from a Fano-resonant Si metasurface that possesses a classical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency. The harmonic emission is enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to unpatterned samples. The enhanced high harmonics are highly anisotropic with respect to the excitation polarization and are selective by the excitation wavelength due to its resonant features. By combining nanofabrication technology and ultrafast strong-field physics, our work paves the way for the design of new compact ultrafast photonic devices that operate under high intensities and at short wavelengths.</p>",[],False,"[""Hanzhe Liu"", ""Cheng Guo"", ""Giulio Vampa"", ""Jingyuan Linda Zhang"", ""Tomas Sarmiento"", ""Meng Xiao"", ""Philip H.

letter,Topological spin excitations in a three-dimensional antiferromagnet,"<p>Band topology, namely the global wavefunction structure that gives rise to the properties observed in the bulk and on the surface of crystalline materials, is currently a topic under intense investigation for both fundamental interest and its technological potential. While topological band crossing in three dimensions was first studied for electrons in semimetals, the underlying physical idea is not restricted to fermions and similar band structures of electromagnetic waves have been observed in artificial structures. Fundamental bosonic excitations in real crystals, however, have not been observed to exhibit any counterparts. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to reveal the presence of topological spin excitations (magnons) in a three-dimensional antiferromagnet, Cu<sub>3</sub>TeO<sub>6</sub>, which features a unique lattice of magnetic spin-1/2 Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions. Further to previous works on this system, we find that the Cu<sup>2+</sup> spins interact over a variety of distances, with the ninth-nearest-neighbour interaction being particularly strong. While the presence of topological magnon band crossing is independent of model details, the far-reaching interactions suppress quantum fluctuations and make the magnon signals sharp and intense. Using accurate measurement and calculation, we visualize two magnon bands that cross at Dirac points protected by (approximate) U(1) spin-rotation symmetry. As a limiting case of topological nodal lines with Z<sub>2</sub>-monopole charges, these Dirac points are new to the family of experimentally confirmed topological band structures. Our results render magnon systems a fertile ground for exploring novel band topology with neutron scattering, along with distinct observables in other related experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Weiliang Yao"", ""Chenyuan Li"", ""Lichen Wang"", ""Shangjie Xue"", ""Yang Dan"", ""Kazuki Iida"", ""Kazuya Kamazawa"", ""Kangkang Li"", ""Chen Fang"", ""Yuan Li""]","Yao, W., Li, C., Wang, L. et al.

letter,Entropic effects in cell lineage tree packings,"<p>Optimal packings of unconnected objects have been studied for centuries, but the packing principles of linked objects, such as topologically complex polymers or cell lineages, are yet to be fully explored. Here, we identify and investigate a generic class of geometrically frustrated tree packing problems, arising during the initial stages of animal development when interconnected cells assemble within a convex enclosure. Using a combination of 3D imaging, computational image analysis and mathematical modelling, we study the tree packing problem in Drosophila egg chambers, where 16 germline cells are linked by cytoplasmic bridges to form a branched tree. Our imaging data reveal non-uniformly distributed tree packings, in agreement with predictions from energy-based computations. This departure from uniformity is entropic and affects cell organization during the first stages of the animal&#8217;s development. Considering mathematical models of increasing complexity, we investigate spherically confined tree packing problems on convex polyhedra that generalize Platonic and Archimedean solids. Our experimental and theoretical results provide a basis for understanding the principles that govern positional ordering in linked multicellular structures, with implications for tissue organization and dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""Jasmin Imran Alsous"", ""Paul Villoutreix"", ""Norbert Stoop"", ""Stanislav Y.

letter,Acoustic Rabi oscillations between gravitational quantum states and impact on symmetron dark energy,"<p>The standard model of cosmology provides a robust description of the evolution of the Universe. Nevertheless, the small magnitude of the vacuum energy is troubling from a theoretical point of view. An appealing resolution to this problem is to introduce additional scalar fields. However, these have so far escaped experimental detection, suggesting some kind of screening mechanism may be at play. Although extensive exclusion regions in parameter space have been established for one screening candidate&#8212;chameleon fields&#8212;another natural screening mechanism based on spontaneous symmetry breaking has also been proposed, in the form of symmetrons. Such fields would change the energy of quantum states of ultracold neutrons in the gravitational potential of the Earth. Here, we demonstrate a spectroscopic approach based on the Rabi resonance method that probes these quantum states with a resolution of &#916;E&#8201;=2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;15</sup>&#8201;eV.

article,Quantum formulation of the Einstein equivalence principle,"<p>The validity of just a few physical conditions comprising the Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) suffices to ensure that gravity can be understood as spacetime geometry. The EEP is therefore subject to ongoing experimental verification, with present-day tests reaching the regime in which quantum mechanics becomes relevant. Here we show that the classical expression of the EEP does not apply in such a regime. The EEP requires equivalence between the rest mass-energy of a system, the mass-energy that constitutes its inertia, and the mass-energy that constitutes its weight. In quantum mechanics, the energy contributing to the mass is given by a Hamiltonian operator of the internal degrees of freedom. Therefore, we introduce a quantum expression of the EEP&#8212;equivalence between the rest, inertial and gravitational internal energy operators. Validity of the classical EEP does not imply the validity of its quantum formulation, which thus requires independent experimental verification. We propose new tests as well as re-analysing existing experiments, and we discuss to what extent they allow quantum aspects of the EEP to be tested.</p>",[],False,"[""Magdalena Zych"", ""\u010caslav Brukner""]","Zych, M., Brukner, Č.

article,Measurements in two bases are sufficient for certifying high-dimensional entanglement,"<p>High-dimensional encoding of quantum information provides a way of transcending the limitations of current approaches to quantum communication, which are mostly based on the entanglement between qubits&#8212;two-dimensional quantum systems. One of the central challenges in the pursuit of high-dimensional alternatives is ascertaining the presence of high-dimensional entanglement within a given high-dimensional quantum state. In particular, it would be desirable to carry out such entanglement certification without resorting to inefficient full state tomography. Here, we show how carefully constructed measurements in two bases (one of which is not orthonormal) can be used to faithfully and efficiently certify bipartite high-dimensional states and their entanglement for any physical platform. To showcase the practicality of this approach under realistic conditions, we put it to the test for photons entangled in their orbital angular momentum. In our experimental set-up, we are able to verify 9-dimensional entanglement for a pair of photons on a 11-dimensional subspace each, at present the highest amount certified without any assumptions on the state.</p>",[],False,"[""Jessica Bavaresco"", ""Natalia Herrera Valencia"", ""Claude Kl\u00f6ckl"", ""Matej Pivoluska"", ""Paul Erker"", ""Nicolai Friis"", ""Mehul Malik"", ""Marcus Huber""]","Bavaresco, J., Herrera Valencia, N., Klöckl, C. et al.

article,Routing the emission of a near-surface light source by a magnetic field,"<p>Magneto-optical phenomena such as the Faraday and Kerr effects play a central role in controlling the polarization and intensity of optical fields propagating through a medium. Intensity effects in which the direction of light emission depends on the orientation of the external magnetic field are of particular interest, as they can be harnessed for routing light. Effects known so far for accomplishing such routing all control light emission along the axis parallel to the magnetic field. Here we report a new class of emission phenomena where directionality is established perpendicular to the externally applied magnetic field for light sources located in the vicinity of a surface. As a proof of principle for this effect, which we call transverse magnetic routing of light emission, we demonstrate the routing of emission for excitons in a diluted-magnetic-semiconductor quantum well. In hybrid plasmonic semiconductor structures, we observe significantly enhanced directionality of up to 60%.</p>",[],False,"[""F. Spitzer"", ""A. N. Poddubny"", ""I. A. Akimov"", ""V. F.

article,Doping the holographic Mott insulator,"<p>Mott insulators form because of strong electron repulsions and are at the heart of strongly correlated electron physics. Conventionally these are understood as classical &#8216;traffic jams&#8217; of electrons described by a short-ranged entangled product ground state. Exploiting the holographic duality, which maps the physics of densely entangled matter onto gravitational black hole physics, we show how Mott-like insulators can be constructed departing from entangled non-Fermi liquid metallic states, such as the strange metals found in cuprate superconductors. These &#8216;entangled Mott insulators&#8217; have traits in common with the &#8216;classical&#8217; Mott insulators, such as the formation of a Mott gap in the optical conductivity, super-exchange-like interactions and the formation of &#8216;stripes&#8217; upon doping. They also exhibit new properties: the ordering wavevectors are detached from the number of electrons in the unit cell, and the d.c. resistivity diverges algebraically instead of exponentially as a function of temperature. These results may shed light on the mysterious ordering phenomena observed in underdoped cuprates.</p>",[],False,"[""Tomas Andrade"", ""Alexander Krikun"", ""Koenraad Schalm"", ""Jan Zaanen""]","Andrade, T., Krikun, A., Schalm, K. et al.

article,Coexisting first- and second-order electronic phase transitions in a correlated oxide,"<p>The explanation and control of phase transitions remain cornerstones of contemporary physics. Landau provided an invaluable insight into the thermodynamics of complex systems by formulating their phase transitions in terms of an order parameter. Within this formulation, continuous evolution of the order parameter away from zero classifies the phase transition as second-order, whereas a discontinuous change signals a first-order transition. Here we show that the temperature-tuned insulator&#8211;metal transition in the prototypical correlated electron system NdNiO<sub>3</sub> defies this established binary classification. By harnessing a nanoscale optical probe of the local electronic conductivity, we reveal two physically distinct yet concurrent phase transitions in epitaxial NdNiO<sub>3</sub> films. Whereas the sample bulk exhibits a first-order transition between metal and insulator phases, we resolve anomalous nanoscale domain walls in the insulating state that undergo a distinctly continuous insulator&#8211;metal transition, with hallmarks of second-order behaviour. We ascribe these domain walls to boundaries between antiferromagnetically ordered domains within the charge ordered bulk. The close correspondence of these observations to predictions from a Landau theory of coupled charge and magnetic orders highlights the importance of coupled order parameters in driving the complex phase transition in NdNiO<sub>3</sub>.</p>",[],False,"[""K.

article,Experimental evidence for ultrafast intermolecular relaxation processes in hydrated biomolecules,"<p>Cell and gene damage caused by ionizing radiation has been studied for many years. It is accepted that DNA lesions (single- and double-strand breaks, for example) are induced by secondary species such as radicals, ions and the abundant low-energy secondary electrons generated by the primary radiation. Particularly harmful are dense ionization clusters of several ionization processes within a volume typical for the biomolecular system. Here we report the observation of a damage mechanism in the form of a non-local autoionizing process called intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD). It directly involves DNA constituents or other organic molecules in an aqueous environment. The products are two energetic ions and three reactive secondary electrons that can cause further damage in their vicinity. Hydrogen-bonded complexes that consist of one tetrahydrofuran (THF) molecule&#8212;a surrogate of deoxyribose in the DNA backbone&#8212;and one water molecule are used as a model system. After electron impact ionization of the water molecule in the inner-valence shell the vacancy is filled by an outer-valence electron. The released energy is transferred across the hydrogen bridge and leads to ionization of the neighbouring THF molecule. This energy transfer from water to THF is faster than the otherwise occurring intermolecular proton transfer. The signature of the ICD reaction is identified in triple-coincidence measurements of both ions and one of the final state electrons. These results could improve the understanding of radiation damage in biological tissue.</p>",[],False,"[""Xueguang Ren"", ""Enliang Wang"", ""Anna D. Skitnevskaya"", ""Alexander B.
