letter,Reconstructing the topology of optical polarization knots,"<p>Knots are topological structures describing how a looped thread can be arranged in space. Although most familiar as knotted material filaments, it is also possible to create knots in singular structures within three-dimensional physical fields such as fluid vortices and the nulls of optical fields. Here we produce, in the transverse polarization profile of optical beams, knotted lines of circular transverse polarization. We generate and observe both simple torus knots and links as well as the topologically more complicated figure-eight knot. The presence of these knotted polarization singularities endows a nontrivial topological structure on the entire three-dimensional propagating wavefield. In particular, the contours of constant polarization azimuth form Seifert surfaces of high genus, which we are able to resolve experimentally in a process we call seifertometry. This analysis reveals a level of topological complexity, present in all experimentally generated polarization fields, that goes beyond the conventional reconstruction of polarization singularity lines.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Hugo Larocque', ',\xa0Dominic Mortimer', ',\xa0Robert Fickler', ',\xa0Robert W.

letter,Direct entropy measurement in a mesoscopic quantum system,"<p>The entropy of an electronic system offers important insights into the nature of its quantum mechanical ground state. This is particularly valuable in cases where the state is difficult to identify by conventional experimental probes, such as conductance. Traditionally, entropy measurements are based on bulk properties, such as heat capacity, that are easily observed in macroscopic samples but are unmeasurably small in systems that consist of only a few particles. Here, we develop a mesoscopic circuit to directly measure the entropy of just a few electrons, and demonstrate its efficacy using the well-understood spin statistics of the first, second and third electron ground states in a GaAs quantum dot. The precision of this technique, quantifying the entropy of a single spin-1/2 to within 5% of the expected value of k<sub>B</sub>&#8201;ln&#8201;2, shows its potential for probing more exotic systems. For example, entangled states or those with non-Abelian statistics could be clearly distinguished by their low-temperature entropy.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada', 'authors': ['Nikolaus Hartman', ',\xa0Christian Olsen', ',\xa0Silvia Lüscher', ',\xa0Mohammad Samani', '\xa0&\xa0Joshua Folk']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada', 'authors': ['Nikolaus Hartman', ',\xa0Christian Olsen', ',\xa0Silvia Lüscher', ',\xa0Mohammad Samani', '\xa0&\xa0Joshua Folk']}, {'address': 'Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Mohammad Samani']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA', 'authors': ['Saeed Fallahi', '\xa0&\xa0Michael Manfra']}, {'address': 'Station Q Purdue, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA', 'authors': ['Saeed Fallahi', ',\xa0Geoffrey C.

letter,Phase-controlled coherent dynamics of a single spin under closed-contour interaction,"<p>In three-level quantum systems, interference between two simultaneously driven excitation pathways can give rise to effects such as coherent population trapping and electromagnetically induced transparency. The possibility to exploit these effects has made three-level systems a cornerstone of quantum optics. Coherent driving of the third available transition forms a closed-contour interaction (CCI), which yields fundamentally new phenomena, including phase-controlled coherent population trapping and phase-controlled coherent population dynamics. Despite attractive prospects, prevalent dephasing in experimental systems suitable for CCI driving has made its observation elusive. Here, we exploit recently developed methods for coherent manipulation of nitrogen&#8211;vacancy electronic spins to implement and study highly coherent CCI driving of a single spin. Our experiments reveal phase-controlled quantum interference, reminiscent of electron dynamics on a closed loop threaded by a magnetic flux, which we synthesize from the driving-field phase. Owing to the nature of the dressed states created under CCI, we achieve nearly two orders of magnitude improvement of the dephasing times, even for moderate drive strengths. CCI driving constitutes a novel approach to coherent control of few-level systems, with potential for applications in quantum sensing or quantum information processing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Arne Barfuss', ',\xa0Johannes Kölbl', ',\xa0Lucas Thiel', ',\xa0Jean Teissier', ',\xa0Mark Kasperczyk', '\xa0&\xa0Patrick Maletinsky']}]",False,"['Arne Barfuss', 'Johannes Kölbl', 'Lucas Thiel', 'Jean Teissier', 'Mark Kasperczyk', 'Patrick Maletinsky']","Barfuss, A., Kölbl, J., Thiel, L. et al.

letter,Biexcitonic optical Stark effects in monolayer molybdenum diselenide,"<p>Floquet states, where a periodic optical field coherently drives electrons in solids, can enable novel quantum states of matter. A prominent approach to realize Floquet states is based on the optical Stark effect. Previous studies on the optical Stark effect often treated the excited state in solids as free quasi-particles. However, exciton&#8211;exciton interactions can be sizeably enhanced in low-dimensional systems and may lead to light&#8211;matter interactions that are qualitatively different from those in the non-interacting picture. Here we use monolayer molybdenum diselenide (MoSe<sub>2</sub>) as a model system to demonstrate that the driving optical field can couple a hierarchy of excitonic states, and the many-body inter-valley biexciton state plays a dominant role in the optical Stark effect. Specifically, the exciton&#8211;biexciton coupling in monolayer MoSe<sub>2</sub> breaks down the valley selection rules based on the non-interacting exciton picture. The photon-dressed excitonic states exhibit an energy redshift, splitting or blueshift as the driving photon frequency varies below the exciton transition. We determine a binding energy of 21&#8201;meV for the inter-valley biexciton and a transition dipole moment of 9.3&#8201;debye for the exciton&#8211;biexciton transition. Our study reveals the crucial role of many-body effects in coherent light&#8211;matter interaction in atomically thin two-dimensional materials.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Chaw-Keong Yong', ',\xa0Jason Horng', ',\xa0Alex Wang', ',\xa0Chan-Shan Yang', ',\xa0Chung-Kuan Lin', '\xa0&\xa0Feng Wang']}, {'address': 'School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA', 'authors': ['Yuxia Shen', ',\xa0Hui Cai', '\xa0&\xa0Sefaattin Tongay']}, {'address': 'Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China', 'authors': ['Shilong Zhao']}, {'address': 'National Institute for Materials Science, Tsukuba, Japan', 'authors': ['Kenji Watanabe', '\xa0&\xa0Takashi Taniguchi']}, {'address': 'Material Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Feng Wang']}, {'address': 'Kavli Energy NanoScience Institute at University of California Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Feng Wang']}]",False,"['Chaw-Keong Yong', 'Jason Horng', 'Yuxia Shen', 'Hui Cai', 'Alex Wang', 'Chan-Shan Yang', 'Chung-Kuan Lin', 'Shilong Zhao', 'Kenji Watanabe', 'Takashi Taniguchi', 'Sefaattin Tongay', 'Feng Wang']","Yong, C., Horng, J., Shen, Y. et al.

letter,Complex magnetic order in nickelate slabs,"<p>Magnetic ordering phenomena have a profound influence on the macroscopic properties of correlated-electron materials, but their realistic prediction remains a formidable challenge. An archetypical example is the ternary nickel oxide system RNiO<sub>3</sub> (R&#8201;=&#8201;rare earth), where the period-four magnetic order with proposals of collinear and non-collinear structures and the amplitude of magnetic moments on different Ni sublattices have been subjects of debate for decades. Here we introduce an elementary model system&#8212;NdNiO<sub>3</sub> slabs embedded in a non-magnetic NdGaO<sub>3</sub> matrix&#8212;and use polarized resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) to show that both collinear and non-collinear magnetic structures can be realized, depending on the slab thickness. The crossover between both spin structures is correctly predicted by density functional theory and can be qualitatively understood in a low-energy spin model. We further demonstrate that the amplitude ratio of magnetic moments in neighbouring NiO<sub>6</sub> octahedra can be accurately determined by RXS in combination with a correlated double cluster model. Targeted synthesis of model systems with controlled thickness and synergistic application of polarized RXS and ab initio theory thus provide new perspectives for research on complex magnetism, in analogy to two-dimensional materials created by exfoliation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart, Germany', 'authors': ['M.

letter,Time-resolved collapse and revival of the Kondo state near a quantum phase transition,"<p>One of the most successful paradigms of many-body physics is the concept of quasiparticles: excitations in strongly interacting matter behaving like weakly interacting particles in free space. Quasiparticles in metals are very robust objects. Nevertheless, when a system&#8217;s ground state undergoes a qualitative change at a quantum critical point (QCP), the quasiparticles may disintegrate and give way to an exotic quantum-fluid state of matter. The nature of this breakdown is intensely debated, because the emergent quantum fluid dominates material properties up to high temperatures and might even be related to the occurrence of superconductivity in some compounds. Here we trace the dynamics of heavy-fermion quasiparticles in CeCu<sub>6&#8722;x</sub>Au<sub>x</sub> and monitor their evolution towards the QCP in time-resolved experiments, supported by many-body calculations. A terahertz pulse disrupts the many-body heavy-fermion state. Under emission of a delayed, phase-coherent terahertz reflex the heavy-fermion state recovers, with a coherence time 100 times longer than typically associated with correlated metals. The quasiparticle weight collapses towards the QCP, yet its formation temperature remains constant&#8212;phenomena believed to be mutually exclusive. Coexistence in the same experiment calls for revisions in our view on quantum criticality.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Materials, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['C.

letter,Transport and dispersion across wiggling nanopores,"<p>The transport of fluids at the nanoscale has achieved major breakthroughs over recent years; however, artificial channels still cannot match the efficiency of biological porins in terms of fluxes or selectivity. Pore shape agitation&#8212;due to thermal fluctuations or in response to external stimuli&#8212;is believed to facilitate transport in biochannels, but its impact on transport in artificial pores remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce a general theory for transport through thermally or actively fluctuating channels, which quantifies the impact of pore fluctuations on confined diffusion in terms of the spectral statistics of the channel fluctuations. Our findings demonstrate a complex interplay between transport and surface wiggling: agitation enhances diffusion via the induced fluid flow, but spatial variations in pore geometry can induce a slowing down via entropic trapping, in full agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and existing observations from the literature. Our results elucidate the impact of pore agitation in a broad range of artificial and biological porins, but also, at larger scales, in vascular motion in fungi, intestinal contractions and microfluidic surface waves. These results open up the possibility that transport across membranes can be actively tuned by external stimuli, with potential applications to nanoscale pumping, osmosis and dynamical ultrafiltration.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Laboratoire de Physique Statistique, Ecole Normale Supérieure and CNRS, PSL University, Paris, France', 'authors': ['Sophie Marbach', '\xa0&\xa0Lydéric Bocquet']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire Ondes et Matière d’Aquitaine (LOMA), CNRS, UMR 5798 Université de Bordeaux, Talence, France', 'authors': ['David S.

letter,Targeted assembly and synchronization of self-spinning microgears,"<p>Self-assembly is the autonomous organization of components into patterns or structures: an essential ingredient of biology and a desired route to complex organization. At equilibrium, the structure is encoded through specific interactions, at an unfavourable entropic cost for the system. An alternative approach, widely used by nature, uses energy input to bypass the entropy bottleneck and develop features otherwise impossible at equilibrium. Dissipative building blocks that inject energy locally were made available by recent advances in colloidal science but have not been used to control self-assembly. Here we show the targeted formation of self-powered microgears from active particles and their autonomous synchronization into dynamical superstructures. We use a photoactive component that consumes fuel, haematite, to devise phototactic microswimmers that form self-spinning microgears following spatiotemporal light patterns. The gears are coupled via their chemical clouds by diffusiophoresis and constitute the elementary bricks of synchronized superstructures, which autonomously regulate their dynamics. The results are quantitatively rationalized on the basis of a stochastic description of diffusio-phoretic oscillators dynamically coupled by chemical gradients. Our findings harness non-equilibrium phoretic phenomena to program interactions and direct self-assembly with fidelity and specificity. It lays the groundwork for the autonomous construction of dynamical architectures and functional micro-machinery.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Antoine Aubret', '\xa0&\xa0Jérémie Palacci']}, {'address': 'Department of Chemistry, New York University, New York, NY, USA', 'authors': ['Mena Youssef', '\xa0&\xa0Stefano Sacanna']}]",False,"['Antoine Aubret', 'Mena Youssef', 'Stefano Sacanna', 'Jérémie Palacci']","Aubret, A., Youssef, M., Sacanna, S. et al.

letter,Giant anomalous Nernst effect and quantum-critical scaling in a ferromagnetic semimetal,"<p>In conducting ferromagnets, an anomalous Nernst effect&#8212;the generation of an electric voltage perpendicular to both the magnetization and an applied temperature gradient&#8212;can be driven by the nontrivial geometric structure, or Berry curvature, of the wavefunction of the electrons. Here, we report the observation of a giant anomalous Nernst effect at room temperature in the full-Heusler ferromagnet Co<sub>2</sub>MnGa, an order of magnitude larger than the previous maximum value reported for a magnetic conductor. Our numerical and analytical calculations indicate that the proximity to a quantum Lifshitz transition between type-I and type-II magnetic Weyl fermions is responsible for the observed &#8211;Tlog(T) behaviour, with T denoting the temperature, and the enhanced value of the transverse thermoelectric conductivity. The temperature dependence of the thermoelectric response in experiments and numerical calculations can be understood in terms of a quantum critical-scaling function predicted by the low-energy effective theory over more than a decade of temperatures. Moreover, the observation of an unsaturated positive longitudinal magnetoconductance, or chiral anomaly, also provides evidence for the existence of Weyl fermions in Co<sub>2</sub>MnGa.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Japan', 'authors': ['Akito Sakai', ',\xa0Agustinus Agung Nugroho', ',\xa0Rombang Sihombing', ',\xa0Rieko Ishii', ',\xa0Daisuke Nishio-Hamane', '\xa0&\xa0Satoru Nakatsuji']}, {'address': 'CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Kawaguchi, Japan', 'authors': ['Akito Sakai', ',\xa0Takashi Koretsune', ',\xa0Michi-To Suzuki', ',\xa0Ryotaro Arita', '\xa0&\xa0Satoru Nakatsuji']}, {'address': 'Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan', 'authors': ['Yo Pierre Mizuta']}, {'address': 'Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), RIKEN, Hirosawa, Wako, Japan', 'authors': ['Yo Pierre Mizuta', ',\xa0Takashi Koretsune', ',\xa0Michi-To Suzuki', ',\xa0Nayuta Takemori', '\xa0&\xa0Ryotaro Arita']}, {'address': 'Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia', 'authors': ['Agustinus Agung Nugroho', '\xa0&\xa0Rombang Sihombing']}, {'address': 'Condensed Matter Theory Center and Joint Quantum Institute, Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA', 'authors': ['Pallab Goswami']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA', 'authors': ['Pallab Goswami']}]",False,"['Akito Sakai', 'Yo Pierre Mizuta', 'Agustinus Agung Nugroho', 'Rombang Sihombing', 'Takashi Koretsune', 'Michi-To Suzuki', 'Nayuta Takemori', 'Rieko Ishii', 'Daisuke Nishio-Hamane', 'Ryotaro Arita', 'Pallab Goswami', 'Satoru Nakatsuji']","Sakai, A., Mizuta, Y.P., Nugroho, A.A. et al.

article,Giant anomalous Hall effect in a ferromagnetic kagome-lattice semimetal,"<p>Magnetic Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry are expected to generate strong intrinsic anomalous Hall effects, due to their large Berry curvature. Here, we report a magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate, Co<sub>3</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, with a quasi-two-dimensional crystal structure consisting of stacked kagome lattices. This lattice provides an excellent platform for hosting exotic topological quantum states. We observe a negative magnetoresistance that is consistent with the chiral anomaly expected from the presence of Weyl fermions close to the Fermi level. The anomalous Hall conductivity is robust against both increased temperature and charge conductivity, which corroborates the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism in momentum space. Owing to the low carrier density in this material and the considerably enhanced Berry curvature from its band structure, the anomalous Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall angle simultaneously reach 1,130&#8201;&#937;<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> and 20%, respectively, an order of magnitude larger than typical magnetic systems.

article,Precision spectroscopy of helium in a magic wavelength optical dipole trap,"<p>Improvements in both theory and frequency metrology of few-electron systems such as hydrogen and helium have enabled increasingly sensitive tests of quantum electrodynamics, as well as ever more accurate determinations of fundamental constants and the size of the nucleus. At the same time, advances in cooling and trapping of neutral atoms have revolutionized the development of increasingly accurate atomic clocks. Here, we combine these fields to reach very high precision on an optical transition in the helium atom by employing a <sup>4</sup>He Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate confined in a magic wavelength optical dipole trap. The measured transition accurately connects the ortho- and parastates of helium and constitutes a stringent test of quantum electrodynamics theory. In addition, we test polarizability calculations and ultracold scattering properties of the helium atom. Finally, our measurement lays the foundation for a determination of the <sup>3</sup>He&#8211;<sup>4</sup>He nuclear charge radius difference with an accuracy exceeding that of muonic helium measurements currently being performed in the context of the proton radius puzzle.</p>",,"[{'address': 'LaserLaB, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands', 'authors': ['R.

article,"Superconducting, insulating and anomalous metallic regimes in a gated two-dimensional semiconductor–superconductor array","<p>The superconductor&#8211;insulator transition in two dimensions has been widely investigated as a paradigmatic quantum phase transition. The topic remains controversial because many experiments exhibit a metallic regime with saturating low-temperature resistance, which is at odds with conventional theory. Here, we explore this transition in a highly controllable system, a semiconductor heterostructure with epitaxial aluminium, patterned to form a regular array of superconducting islands connected by a gateable quantum well. Spanning nine orders of magnitude in resistance, the system exhibits regimes of superconducting, metallic and insulating behaviour, along with signatures of flux commensurability and vortex penetration. An in-plane magnetic field eliminates the metallic regime, restoring the direct superconductor&#8211;insulator transition; it also improves the scaling behaviour while strongly altering the scaling exponent.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark', 'authors': ['C.
