letter,Characterization of the shape-staggering effect in mercury nuclei,"<p>In rare cases, the removal of a single proton (Z) or neutron (N) from an atomic nucleus leads to a dramatic shape change. These instances are crucial for understanding the components of the nuclear interactions that drive deformation. The mercury isotopes (Z&#8201;=&#8201;80) are a striking example: their close neighbours, the lead isotopes (Z&#8201;=&#8201;82), are spherical and steadily shrink with decreasing N. The even-mass (A&#8201;=&#8201;N&#8201;+&#8201;Z) mercury isotopes follow this trend. The odd-mass mercury isotopes <sup>181,183,185</sup>Hg, however, exhibit noticeably larger charge radii. Due to the experimental difficulties of probing extremely neutron-deficient systems, and the computational complexity of modelling such heavy nuclides, the microscopic origin of this unique shape staggering has remained unclear. Here, by applying resonance ionization spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and nuclear spectroscopy as far as <sup>177</sup>Hg, we determine <sup>181</sup>Hg as the shape-staggering endpoint. By combining our experimental measurements with Monte Carlo shell model calculations, we conclude that this phenomenon results from the interplay between monopole and quadrupole interactions driving a quantum phase transition, for which we identify the participating orbitals. Although shape staggering in the mercury isotopes is a unique and localized feature in the nuclear chart, it nicely illustrates the concurrence of single-particle and collective degrees of freedom at play in atomic nuclei.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

letter,Superradiant emission from colour centres in diamond,"<p>Superradiance is a fundamental collective effect where radiation is amplified by the coherence of multiple emitters. Superradiance plays a prominent role in optics (where it enables the design of lasers with substantially reduced linewidths) and quantum mechanics, and is even used to explain cosmological observations such as Hawking radiation from black holes. Resonators coupled to spin ensembles are promising future building blocks of integrated quantum devices that will involve superradiance. As such, it is important to study its fundamental properties within such devices. Although experiments in the strong-coupling regime have shown oscillatory behaviour in these systems, a clear signature of Dicke superradiance has so far been missing. Here we explore superradiance in a system composed of a three-dimensional lumped element resonator in the fast cavity limit inductively coupled to an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of nitrogen&#8211;vacancy centres. We observe a superradiant pulse being emitted a trillion times faster than the decay for an individual nitrogen&#8211;vacancy centre. This is further confirmed by the nonlinear scaling of the emitted radiation intensity with respect to the ensemble size. Our work provides the foundation for future quantum technologies including solid-state superradiant masers.</p>",[],False,"[""Andreas Angerer"", ""Kirill Streltsov"", ""Thomas Astner"", ""Stefan Putz"", ""Hitoshi Sumiya"", ""Shinobu Onoda"", ""Junichi Isoya"", ""William J.

letter,Driven-dissipative non-equilibrium Bose–Einstein condensation of less than ten photons,"<p>In a Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate, bosons condense in the lowest-energy mode available and exhibit high coherence. Quantum condensation is inherently a multimode phenomenon, yet understanding of the condensation transition in the macroscopic limit is hampered by the difficulty in resolving populations of individual modes and the coherences between them. Here, we report non-equilibrium Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation of 7&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2 photons in a sculpted dye-filled microcavity, where the extremely small particle number and large mode spacing of the condensate allow us to measure occupancies and coherences of the individual energy levels of the bosonic field. Coherence of the individual modes is found to generally increase with increasing photon number. However, at the break-down of thermal equilibrium we observe phase transitions to a multimode condensate regime wherein coherence unexpectedly decreases with increasing population, suggesting the presence of strong intermode phase or number correlations despite the absence of a direct nonlinearity. Experiments are well-matched to a detailed non-equilibrium model. We find that microlaser and Bose&#8211;Einstein statistics each describe complementary parts of our data and are limits of our model in appropriate regimes, providing elements to inform the debate on the differences between the two concepts.</p>",[],False,"[""Benjamin T.

letter,Visualization of the periodic modulation of Cooper pairing in a cuprate superconductor,"<p>In cuprate superconductors, the existence of various intertwined orders associated with spin, charge and Cooper pairs is an obstacle in understanding the mechanism of Cooper pairing. The ubiquitous charge order is particularly important. Various theories have been proposed to explain the origin of the charge order and its implications for the superconducting phase, including charge stripes, electronic nematicity and Fermi surface instability. A highly appealing physical picture is the &#8216;pair density wave&#8217;, a spatially periodic modulation of Cooper pairing, which may also induce a charge order. To elucidate the existence and nature of the pair density wave, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to investigate a severely underdoped cuprate, in which superconductivity just emerges on top of a pronounced chequerboard charge order. We observe a periodic modulation of both the superconducting coherence peak and gap depth, indicating the existence of a density wave order of Cooper pairing based on the empirical relationship between superconducting coherence and superfluid density. The pair density wave has the same spatial periodicity as the charge order, and the amplitudes of the two orders exhibit clear positive correlation. These results shed new light on the origin of and interplay between the charge order and Cooper pairing modulation in the cuprates.</p>",[],False,"[""Wei Ruan"", ""Xintong Li"", ""Cheng Hu"", ""Zhenqi Hao"", ""Haiwei Li"", ""Peng Cai"", ""Xingjiang Zhou"", ""Dung-Hai Lee"", ""Yayu Wang""]","Ruan, W., Li, X., Hu, C. et al.

letter,Charge trapping and super-Poissonian noise centres in a cuprate superconductor,"<p>The electronic properties of cuprate high-temperature superconductors in their normal state are highly two-dimensional: transport along the crystal planes is perfectly metallic, but is insulating along the perpendicular &#8216;c-axis&#8217; direction. The ratio of the in-plane to the perpendicular resistance can exceed 10<sup>4</sup> (refs ). This anisotropy was identified as one of the mysteries of the cuprates early on, and although widely different proposals exist for its microscopic origin, there is little empirical information on the microscopic scale. Here, we elucidate the properties of the insulating layers with a newly developed scanning noise spectroscopy technique that can spatially map the current and its time-resolved fluctuations. We discover atomic-scale noise centres that exhibit megahertz current fluctuations 40 times the expectation from Poissonian noise, more than what has been observed in mesoscopic systems. Such behaviour can happen only in highly polarizable insulators and represents strong evidence for trapping of charge in the charge reservoir layers. Our measurements suggest a picture of metallic layers separated by polarizable insulators within a three-dimensional superconducting state.</p>",[],False,"[""K. M. Bastiaans"", ""D. Cho"", ""T.

letter,Leidenfrost wheels,"<p>As reported in 1756 by Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, volatile liquids on hot solids form &#8220;gleaming drops resembling quicksilver&#8221;, a consequence of their levitation on a vapour cushion. This makes the drops spectacularly mobile, moving away as soon as they are deposited&#8212;an observation commonly attributed to gravity or surrounding airflows. This mobility has been exploited to manipulate drops, because tiny forces such as those generated on asymmetric substrates can move them in well-defined directions, a situation that also provides heat evacuation. Here we report that Leidenfrost droplets initially at rest on horizontal substrates self-rotate and self-propel in the direction they are rolling, in the absence of any source of asymmetry or external force. Their rapid internal flow is found to be accompanied by a tilting of their base, which creates a permanent ratchet-like mechanism, entraining the rolling liquid despite the fact that it is not in contact with its substrate.</p>",[],False,"[""Ambre Bouillant"", ""Timoth\u00e9e Mouterde"", ""Philippe Bourrianne"", ""Antoine Lagarde"", ""Christophe Clanet"", ""David Qu\u00e9r\u00e9""]","Bouillant, A., Mouterde, T., Bourrianne, P. et al.

letter,Collective mechanical adaptation of honeybee swarms,"<p>Honeybee Apis mellifera swarms form large congested tree-hanging clusters made solely of bees attached to each other. How these structures are maintained under the influence of dynamic mechanical forcing is unknown. To address this, we created pendant clusters and subject them to dynamic loads of varying orientation, amplitude, frequency and duration. We find that horizontally shaken clusters adapt by spreading out to form wider, flatter cones that recover their original shape when unloaded. Measuring the response of a cluster to an impulsive pendular excitation shows that flattened cones deform less and relax faster than the elongated ones (that is, they are more stable). Particle-based simulations of a passive assemblage suggest a behavioural hypothesis: individual bees respond to local variations in strain by moving up the strain gradient, which is qualitatively consistent with our observations of individual bee movement during dynamic loading. The simulations also suggest that vertical shaking will not lead to significant differential strains and thus no shape adaptation, which we confirmed experimentally. Together, our findings highlight how a super-organismal structure responds to dynamic loading by actively changing its morphology to improve the collective stability of the cluster at the expense of increasing the average mechanical burden of an individual.</p>",[],False,"[""O.

article,Biexciton fine structure in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides,<p>The optical properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors are shaped by the emergence of correlated many-body complexes due to strong Coulomb interaction. Exceptional electron&#8211;hole exchange predestines TMDCs to be used to study fundamental and applied properties of Coulomb complexes such as valley depolarization of excitons and fine-structure splitting of trions. Biexcitons in these materials are less well understood and it has been established only recently that they are spectrally located between excitons and trions.

Ultrafast pump&#8211;probe experiments on monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub> reveal decisive biexciton signatures and a fine structure in excellent agreement with a microscopic theory.

article,Imaging quantum fluctuations near criticality,"<p>A quantum phase transition (QPT) occurs between two competing phases of matter at zero temperature, driven by quantum fluctuations. Although the presence of these fluctuations is well established, they have not been locally imaged in space, and their local dynamics has not been studied so far. We use a scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image quantum fluctuations near the QPT from a superconductor to an insulator. We find fluctuations of the diamagnetic response in both space and time that survive well below the transition temperature, demonstrating their quantum nature. The fluctuations appear as telegraph-like noise with a range of characteristic times and a non-monotonic temperature dependence, revealing unexpected quantum granularity. The lateral dimension of these fluctuations grows towards criticality, offering a new measurable length scale.

article,Membrane-induced hydroelastic migration of a particle surfing its own wave,"<p>While coupling between fluid flow and soft elastic surfaces is common in biology and engineering, an analytical description is challenging as it often involves non-linear dynamics. Here we show using theory and experiments that a small particle moving along an elastic membrane through a viscous fluid is repelled from the membrane due to hydroelastic forces. The flow field produces an elastic disturbance in the membrane leading to particle&#8211;wave coupling. We derive an analytic expression for the particle trajectory and find that the normal migration velocity of the particle is quadratic in its speed and depends on a combination of the tension and bending resistance of the membrane. Experimentally, we measure the normal displacement of spheres sedimenting under gravity along a suspended elastic membrane and find quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions with no fitting parameters. We experimentally demonstrate that the effect is strong enough for separation and sorting of particles on the basis of both their size and density. We discuss the significance of our results for particles interacting with biological membranes, and propose the use of our model for membrane elasticity measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""Bhargav Rallabandi"", ""Naomi Oppenheimer"", ""Matan Yah Ben Zion"", ""Howard A.

article,Polygonal motion and adaptable phototaxis via flagellar beat switching in the microswimmer Euglena gracilis,"<p>Biological microswimmers exhibit versatile strategies for sensing and navigating their environment, such as run-and-tumble and curvature modulation. Here, we report a striking phototactic behaviour of the microswimmer Euglena gracilis, where these eukaryotic cells swim in polygonal trajectories due to a sudden increase in light intensity. While smoothly curved trajectories are common for microswimmers, such quantized ones have not been reported previously. We find that this polygonal behaviour emerges from periodic switching between the flagellar beating patterns of helical swimming and spinning behaviours. We develop and experimentally validate a biophysical model that describes the phase relationship between the eyespot, cell orientation, light detection and cellular reorientation, accounting for all three behavioural states. Coordinated switching between these behaviours selects for ballistic, superdiffusive, diffusive or subdiffusive motion (including tuning the effective diffusion constant over several orders of magnitude), thereby enabling navigation in spatially structured light fields, such as edge avoidance and gradient descent. This feedback control links multiple system scales (flagellar beats, cellular behaviours and phototaxis strategies), with implications for other natural and synthetic microswimmers.</p>",[],False,"[""Alan C.

article,3D field phase-space control in tokamak plasmas,"<p>A small relaxation of the axisymmetric magnetic field of a tokamak into a non-axisymmetric three-dimensional (3D) configuration can be effective to control magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, such as edge-localized modes. However, a major challenge to the concept of 3D tokamaks is that there are virtually unlimited possible choices for a 3D magnetic field, and most of them will only destabilize or degrade plasmas by symmetry breaking. Here, we demonstrate the phase-space visualization of the full 3D field-operating windows of a tokamak, which allows us to predict which configurations will maintain high confinement without magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in an entire region of plasmas. We test our approach at the Korean Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) facility, whose 3D coils with many degrees of freedom in the coil space make it unique for this purpose. Our experiments show that only a small subset of coil configurations can accomplish edge-localized mode suppression without terminating the discharge with core magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, as predicted by the perturbative 3D expansion of plasma equilibrium and the optimizing principle of local resonance. The prediction provided excellent guidance, implying that our method can substantially improve the efficiency and fidelity of the 3D optimization process in tokamaks.</p>",[],False,"[""Jong-Kyu Park"", ""YoungMu Jeon"", ""Yongkyoon In"", ""Joon-Wook Ahn"", ""Raffi Nazikian"", ""Gunyoung Park"", ""Jaehyun Kim"", ""HyungHo Lee"", ""WonHa Ko"", ""Hyun-Seok Kim"", ""Nikolas C.
