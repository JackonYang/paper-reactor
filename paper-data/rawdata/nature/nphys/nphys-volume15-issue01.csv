review article,High-harmonic generation from solids,"<p>High-harmonic generation in atomic gases has been studied for decades, and has formed the basis of attosecond science. Observation of high-order harmonics from bulk crystals was, however, reported much more recently, in 2010. This Review surveys the subsequent efforts aimed at understanding the microscopic mechanism of solid-state harmonics in terms of what it can tell us about the electronic structure of the source materials, how it can be used to probe driven ultrafast dynamics and its prospects for novel, compact short-wavelength light sources. Although most of this work has focused on bulk materials as the source, recent experiments have investigated high-harmonic generation from engineered structures, which could form flexible platforms for attosecond photonics.</p>",[],False,"[""Shambhu Ghimire"", ""David A.

letter,Wavelength-scale errors in optical localization due to spin–orbit coupling of light,"<p>Far-field optical imaging techniques allow the determination of the position of point-like emitters and scatterers. Although the optical wavelength sets a fundamental limit to the image resolution of unknown objects, the position of an individual emitter can in principle be estimated from the image with arbitrary precision. This is used, for example, in the determination of the position of stars or in optical super-resolution microscopy. Furthermore, precise position determination is an experimental prerequisite for the manipulation and measurement of individual quantum systems, such as atoms, ions and solid-state-based quantum emitters. Here we demonstrate that spin&#8211;orbit coupling of light in the emission of elliptically polarized emitters can lead to systematic, wavelength-scale errors in the estimation of the emitter&#8217;s position. Imaging a single trapped atom as well as a single sub-wavelength-diameter gold nanoparticle, we demonstrate a shift between the emitters&#8217; measured and actual positions, which is comparable to the optical wavelength. For certain settings, the expected shift can become arbitrarily large. Beyond optical imaging techniques, our findings could be relevant for the localization of objects using any type of wave that carries orbital angular momentum relative to the emitter&#8217;s position with a component orthogonal to the direction of observation.</p>",[],False,"[""G.

letter,Spin pumping from nuclear spin waves,"<p>Various spintronic phenomena originate from the exchange of angular momentum between the spin of electrons and other degrees of freedom in crystalline materials. Many degrees of freedom, such as magnetization and mechanical motion, have already been united into this exchange framework. However, the nuclear spin&#8212;a key angular momentum&#8212;has yet to be incorporated. Here we observe spin pumping from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), in which nuclear spin dynamics emits a spin current, a flow of spin angular momentum of electrons. By using the canted antiferromagnet MnCO<sub>3</sub>, in which typical nuclear spin-wave formation is established due to the reinforced hyperfine coupling, we find that a spin current is generated from an NMR. Nuclear spins are indispensable for quantum information technology and are also frequently used in various sensors, such as in magnetic resonance imaging. The observed NMR spin pumping allows spin-current generation from nuclei and will enable spintronic detection of nuclear spin states.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuki Shiomi"", ""Jana Lustikova"", ""Shingo Watanabe"", ""Daichi Hirobe"", ""Saburo Takahashi"", ""Eiji Saitoh""]","Shiomi, Y., Lustikova, J., Watanabe, S. et al.

letter,Evidence for topological defects in a photoinduced phase transition,"<p>Upon excitation with an intense laser pulse, a symmetry-broken ground state can undergo a non-equilibrium phase transition through pathways different from those in thermal equilibrium. The mechanism underlying these photoinduced phase transitions has long been researched in the study of condensed matter systems, but many details in this ultrafast, non-adiabatic regime still remain to be clarified. To this end, we investigate the light-induced melting of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in LaTe<sub>3</sub>. Using a suite of time-resolved probes, we independently track the amplitude and phase dynamics of the CDW. We find that a fast (approximately 1 picosecond) recovery of the CDW amplitude is followed by a slower re-establishment of phase coherence. This longer timescale is dictated by the presence of topological defects: long-range order is inhibited and is only restored when the defects annihilate. Our results provide a framework for understanding other photoinduced phase transitions by identifying the generation of defects as a governing mechanism.</p>",[],False,"[""Alfred Zong"", ""Anshul Kogar"", ""Ya-Qing Bie"", ""Timm Rohwer"", ""Changmin Lee"", ""Edoardo Baldini"", ""Emre Erge\u00e7en"", ""Mehmet B.

letter,Excess resistivity in graphene superlattices caused by umklapp electron–electron scattering,"<p>In electronic transport, umklapp processes play a fundamental role as the only intrinsic mechanism that allows electrons to transfer momentum to the crystal lattice and, therefore, provide a finite electrical resistance in pure metals. However, umklapp scattering is difficult to demonstrate in experiment, as it is easily obscured by other dissipation mechanisms. Here we show that electron&#8211;electron umklapp scattering dominates the transport properties of graphene-on-boron-nitride superlattices over a wide range of temperature and carrier density. The umklapp processes cause giant excess resistivity that rapidly increases with increasing superlattice period and are responsible for deterioration of the room-temperature mobility by more than an order of magnitude as compared to standard, non-superlattice graphene devices. The umklapp scattering exhibits a quadratic temperature dependence accompanied by a pronounced electron&#8211;hole asymmetry with the effect being much stronger for holes than electrons. In addition to being of fundamental interest, our results have direct implications for design of possible electronic devices based on heterostructures featuring superlattices.</p>",[],False,"[""J. R.

letter,Neutrino tomography of Earth,"<p>Cosmic-ray interactions with the atmosphere produce a flux of neutrinos in all directions with energies extending above the TeV scale. The Earth is not a fully transparent medium for neutrinos with energies above a few TeV, as the neutrino&#8211;nucleon cross-section is large enough to make the absorption probability non-negligible. Since absorption depends on energy and distance travelled, studying the distribution of the TeV atmospheric neutrinos passing through the Earth offers an opportunity to infer its density profile. This has never been done, however, due to the lack of relevant data. Here we perform a neutrino-based tomography of the Earth using actual data&#8212;one-year of through-going muon atmospheric neutrino data collected by the IceCube telescope. Using only weak interactions, in a way that is completely independent of gravitational measurements, we are able to determine the mass of the Earth and its core, its moment of inertia, and to establish that the core is denser than the mantle. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to study the Earth&#8217;s internal structure, which is complementary to traditional geophysics methods. Neutrino tomography could become more competitive as soon as more statistics is available, provided that the sources of systematic uncertainties are fully under control.</p>",[],False,"[""Andrea Donini"", ""Sergio Palomares-Ruiz"", ""Jordi Salvado""]","Donini, A., Palomares-Ruiz, S. & Salvado, J.

article,Multiple topological states in iron-based superconductors,"<p>Topological materials and unconventional iron-based superconductors are both important areas of study but, to date, relatively little overlap has been identified between these two fields. However, the combination of topological bands and superconductivity promises the manifestation of exotic superconducting states, including Majorana fermions, the central component of topological quantum computation. Here, using laser-based, spin-resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we have identified both topological insulator and Dirac semimetal states near the Fermi energy in different iron-based superconducting compounds. Carrier doping can tune these topologically non-trivial bands to the Fermi energy, potentially allowing access to several different superconducting topological states in the same material. These results reveal the generic coexistence of superconductivity and multiple topological states in iron-based superconductors, indicating that this broad class of materials is a promising platform for high-temperature topological superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Peng Zhang"", ""Zhijun Wang"", ""Xianxin Wu"", ""Koichiro Yaji"", ""Yukiaki Ishida"", ""Yoshimitsu Kohama"", ""Guangyang Dai"", ""Yue Sun"", ""Cedric Bareille"", ""Kenta Kuroda"", ""Takeshi Kondo"", ""Kozo Okazaki"", ""Koichi Kindo"", ""Xiancheng Wang"", ""Changqing Jin"", ""Jiangping Hu"", ""Ronny Thomale"", ""Kazuki Sumida"", ""Shilong Wu"", ""Koji Miyamoto"", ""Taichi Okuda"", ""Hong Ding"", ""G.

article,Low-temperature anomaly in disordered superconductors near Bc2 as a vortex-glass property,"<p>Strongly disordered superconductors in a magnetic field exhibit many characteristic properties of type-II superconductivity&#8212;except at low temperatures, where an anomalous linear temperature dependence of the resistive critical field B<sub>c2</sub> is routinely observed. This behaviour violates the conventional theory of superconductivity, and its origin has posed a long-standing puzzle. Here we report systematic measurements of the critical magnetic field and current on amorphous indium oxide films with various levels of disorder. Surprisingly, our measurements show that the B<sub>c2</sub> anomaly is accompanied by mean-field-like scaling of the critical current. Based on a comprehensive theoretical study we argue that these observations are a consequence of the vortex-glass ground state and its thermal fluctuations. Our theory further predicts that the linear-temperature anomaly occurs more generally in both films and disordered bulk superconductors, with a slope that depends on the normal-state sheet resistance, which we confirm experimentally.</p>",[],False,"[""Benjamin Sac\u00e9p\u00e9"", ""Johanna Seidemann"", ""Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gay"", ""Kevin Davenport"", ""Andrey Rogachev"", ""Maoz Ovadia"", ""Karen Michaeli"", ""Mikhail V.

article,Selective breakdown of phonon quasiparticles across superionic transition in CuCrSe2,"<p>Superionic crystals exhibit ionic mobilities comparable to liquids while maintaining a periodic crystalline lattice. The atomic dynamics leading to large ionic mobility have long been debated. A central question is whether phonon quasiparticles&#8212;which conduct heat in regular solids&#8212;survive in the superionic state, where a large fraction of the system exhibits liquid-like behaviour. Here we present the results of energy- and momentum-resolved scattering studies combined with first-principles calculations and show that in the superionic phase of CuCrSe<sub>2</sub>, long-wavelength acoustic phonons capable of heat conduction remain largely intact, whereas specific phonon quasiparticles dominated by the Cu ions break down as a result of anharmonicity and disorder. The weak bonding and large anharmonicity of the Cu sublattice are present already in the normal ordered state, resulting in low thermal conductivity even below the superionic transition. These results demonstrate that anharmonic phonon dynamics are at the origin of low thermal conductivity and superionicity in this class of materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Jennifer L.

article,Active wetting of epithelial tissues,"<p>Development, regeneration and cancer involve drastic transitions in tissue morphology. In analogy with the behaviour of inert fluids, some of these transitions have been interpreted as wetting transitions. The validity and scope of this analogy are unclear, however, because the active cellular forces that drive tissue wetting have been neither measured nor theoretically accounted for. Here we show that the transition between two-dimensional epithelial monolayers and three-dimensional spheroidal aggregates can be understood as an active wetting transition whose physics differs fundamentally from that of passive wetting phenomena. By combining an active polar fluid model with measurements of physical forces as a function of tissue size, contractility, cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;substrate adhesion, and substrate stiffness, we show that the wetting transition results from the competition between traction forces and contractile intercellular stresses. This competition defines a new intrinsic length scale that gives rise to a critical size for the wetting transition in tissues, a striking feature that has no counterpart in classical wetting. Finally, we show that active shape fluctuations are dynamically amplified during tissue dewetting. Overall, we conclude that tissue spreading constitutes a prominent example of active wetting&#8212;a novel physical scenario that may explain morphological transitions during tissue morphogenesis and tumour progression.</p>",[],False,"[""Carlos P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez"", ""Ricard Alert"", ""Carles Blanch-Mercader"", ""Manuel G\u00f3mez-Gonz\u00e1lez"", ""Tomasz Kolodziej"", ""Elsa Bazellieres"", ""Jaume Casademunt"", ""Xavier Trepat""]","Pérez-González, C., Alert, R., Blanch-Mercader, C. et al.

article,Phase transition lowering in dynamically compressed silicon,"<p>Silicon, being one of the most abundant elements in nature, attracts wide-ranging scientific and technological interest. Specifically, in its elemental form, crystals of remarkable purity can be produced. One may assume that this would lead to silicon being well understood, and indeed, this is the case for many ambient properties, as well as for higher-pressure behaviour under quasi-static loading. However, despite many decades of study, a detailed understanding of the response of silicon to rapid compression&#8212;such as that experienced under shock impact&#8212;remains elusive. Here, we combine a novel free-electron laser-based X-ray diffraction geometry with laser-driven compression to elucidate the importance of shear generated during shock compression on the occurrence of phase transitions. We observe lowering of the hydrostatic phase boundary in elemental silicon, an ideal model system for investigating high-strength materials, analogous to planetary constituents. Moreover, we unambiguously determine the onset of melting above 14&#8201;GPa, previously ascribed to a solid&#8211;solid phase transition, undetectable in the now conventional shocked diffraction geometry; transitions to the liquid state are expected to be ubiquitous in all systems at sufficiently high pressures and temperatures.</p>",[],False,"[""E.

article,The k-core as a predictor of structural collapse in mutualistic ecosystems,"<p>Collapses of dynamical systems into irrecoverable states are observed in ecosystems, human societies, financial systems and network infrastructures. Despite their widespread occurrence and impact, these events remain largely unpredictable. In searching for the causes for collapse and instability, theoretical investigations have so far been unable to determine quantitatively the influence of the structural features of the network formed by the interacting species. Here, we derive the condition for the stability of a mutualistic ecosystem as a constraint on the strength of the dynamical interactions between species and a topological invariant of the network: the k-core. Our solution predicts that when species located at the maximum k-core of the network go extinct, as a consequence of sufficiently weak interaction strengths, the system will reach the tipping point of its collapse. As a key variable involved in collapse phenomena, monitoring the k-core of the network may prove a powerful method to anticipate catastrophic events in the vast context that stretches from ecological and biological networks to finance.</p>",[],False,"[""Flaviano Morone"", ""Gino Del Ferraro"", ""Hern\u00e1n A.
