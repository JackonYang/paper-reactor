letter,Isotopic variation of parity violation in atomic ytterbium,"<p>The weak force is the only fundamental interaction known to violate the symmetry with respect to spatial inversion (parity). This parity violation can be used to isolate the effects of the weak interaction in atomic systems, providing a unique, low-energy test of the standard model (see, for example, reviews). These experiments are primarily sensitive to the weak force between the valence electrons and the nucleus, mediated by the neutral Z<sup>0</sup> boson and dependent on the weak charge of the nucleus, Q<sub>w</sub>. The standard model parameter Q<sub>w</sub> was most precisely determined in caesium and has provided a stringent test of the standard model at low energy. The standard model also predicts a variation of Q<sub>w</sub> with the number of neutrons in the nucleus, an effect whose direct observation we are reporting here. Our studies, made on a chain of ytterbium isotopes, provide a measurement of isotopic variation in atomic parity violation, confirm the predicted standard model Q<sub>w</sub> scaling and offer information about an additional Z&#8242; boson.</p>",[],False,"[""D.

letter,A photon–photon quantum gate based on Rydberg interactions,"<p>The interaction between Rydberg states of neutral atoms is strong and long-range, making it appealing to put it to use in the context of quantum technologies. Recently, first applications of this idea have been reported in the fields of quantum computation and quantum simulation. Furthermore, electromagnetically induced transparency allows one to map these Rydberg interactions to light. Here we exploit this mapping and the resulting interaction between photons to realize a photon&#8211;photon quantum gate, demonstrating the potential of Rydberg systems as a platform also for quantum communication and quantum networking. We measure a controlled-NOT truth table with a fidelity of 70(8)% and an entangling-gate fidelity of 63.7(4.5)%, both post-selected upon detection of a control and a target photon. The level of control reached here is an encouraging step towards exploring novel many-body states of photons or for future applications in quantum communication and quantum networking.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel Tiarks"", ""Steffen Schmidt-Eberle"", ""Thomas Stolz"", ""Gerhard Rempe"", ""Stephan D\u00fcrr""]","Tiarks, D., Schmidt-Eberle, S., Stolz, T. et al.A photon–photon quantum gate based on Rydberg interactions.

letter,Design and characterization of electrons in a fractal geometry,"<p>The dimensionality of an electronic quantum system is decisive for its properties. In one dimension, electrons form a Luttinger liquid, and in two dimensions, they exhibit the quantum Hall effect. However, very little is known about the behaviour of electrons in non-integer, or fractional dimensions. Here, we show how arrays of artificial atoms can be defined by controlled positioning of CO molecules on a Cu (111) surface, and how these sites couple to form electronic Sierpi&#324;ski fractals. We characterize the electron wavefunctions at different energies with scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, and show that they inherit the fractional dimension. Wavefunctions delocalized over the Sierpi&#324;ski structure decompose into self-similar parts at higher energy, and this scale invariance can also be retrieved in reciprocal space. Our results show that electronic quantum fractals can be artificially created by atomic manipulation in a scanning tunnelling microscope. The same methodology will allow future studies to address fundamental questions about the effects of spin&#8211;orbit interactions and magnetic fields on electrons in non-integer dimensions. Moreover, the rational concept of artificial atoms can readily be transferred to planar semiconductor electronics, allowing for the exploration of electrons in a well-defined fractal geometry, including interactions and external fields.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

letter,Plasmonic dynamics measured with frequency-comb-referenced phase spectroscopy,"<p>The strong confinement of surface plasmons&#8217; optical fields at metal surfaces makes them highly sensitive to the structural shape and refractive index change of target biological, chemical or atomic species. This has made surface plasmon resonance a widely applicable sensing technique. Plasmonic metrology is primarily based on the spectral shift of the scattering intensity spectrum. Although broadband phase spectra are known to provide richer information on target samples as opposed to intensity spectra, direct acquisition of broadband phase spectra in plasmonics has been made difficult by the lack of highly stabilized light sources. Here, we demonstrate that frequency-comb-referenced phase spectroscopy provides high speed, high resolution, and high linearity with respect to plasmonic rulers, with direct traceability to a time standard. As a demonstration, we measure the 1.94&#8201;&#197; dynamic motion of a pair of nanoholes with a resolution of 1.67&#8201;pm. The interaction through the propagation of the plasmonic field is enhanced by a factor of 155 compared to the physical sample length. Our realization of a fast and robust plasmonic ruler with picometre resolution makes it possible to obtain high-precision plasmonic phase spectroscopy for in-depth analysis of the dynamics of samples in nanoscopic volumes.</p>",[],False,"[""Nguyen Duy Anh"", ""Byung Jae Chun"", ""Sungho Choi"", ""Dong-Eon Kim"", ""Seungchul Kim"", ""Young-Jin Kim""]","Anh, N.D., Chun, B.J., Choi, S. et al.

letter,Enhanced energy coupling for indirectly driven inertial confinement fusion,"<p>Recent experiments in the study of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the United States have reached the so-called alpha-heating regime, in which the self-heating by fusion products becomes dominant, with neutron yields now exceeding 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>16</sup> (ref. ) However, there are still challenges on the path towards ignition, such as minimization of the drive asymmetry, suppression of laser-plasma instabilities, and mitigation of fabrication features. In addition, in the current cylindrical-hohlraum indirect drive schemes for ICF, a strong limitation is the inefficient (&#8804;10%) absorption of the laser-produced hohlraum X-rays by the capsule as set by relative capsule-to-hohlraum surface areas. Here we report an experiment demonstrating ~30% energy coupling to an aluminium capsule in a rugby-shaped, gold hohlraum. This high coupling efficiency can substantially increase the tolerance to residual imperfections and improve the prospects for ignition, both in mainline single-shell hot-spot designs and potential double-shell targets.</p>",[],False,"[""Y.

letter,Universal T-linear resistivity and Planckian dissipation in overdoped cuprates,"<p>The perfectly linear temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity observed as T&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;0 in a variety of metals close to a quantum critical point is a major puzzle of condensed-matter physics. Here we show that T-linear resistivity as T&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;0 is a generic property of cuprates, associated with a universal scattering rate. We measured the low-temperature resistivity of the bilayer cuprate Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+&#948;</sub> and found that it exhibits a T-linear dependence with the same slope as in the single-layer cuprates Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>6+&#948;</sub> (ref.&#8201;), La<sub>1.6&#8722;x</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (ref.&#8201;) and La<sub>2&#8722;x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (ref.&#8201;), despite their very different Fermi surfaces and structural, superconducting and magnetic properties. We then show that the T-linear coefficient (per CuO<sub>2</sub> plane), A<sub>1</sub><sup>&#9633;</sup>, is given by the universal relation A<sub>1</sub><sup>&#9633;</sup>T<sub>F</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;h/2e<sup>2</sup>, where e is the electron charge, h is the Planck constant and T<sub>F</sub> is the Fermi temperature. This relation, obtained by assuming that the scattering rate 1/&#964; of charge carriers reaches the Planckian limit, whereby &#295;/&#964;&#8201;=&#8201;k<sub>B</sub>T, works not only for hole-doped cuprates but also for electron-doped cuprates, despite the different nature of their quantum critical point and strength of their electron correlations.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

letter,High-dimensional one-way quantum processing implemented on d-level cluster states,"<p>Taking advantage of quantum mechanics for executing computational tasks faster than classical computers or performing measurements with precision exceeding the classical limit requires the generation of specific large and complex quantum states. In this context, cluster states are particularly interesting because they can enable the realization of universal quantum computers by means of a &#8216;one-way&#8217; scheme, where processing is performed through measurements. The generation of cluster states based on sub-systems that have more than two dimensions, d-level cluster states, provides increased quantum resources while keeping the number of parties constant, and also enables novel algorithms. Here, we experimentally realize, characterize and test the noise sensitivity of three-level, four-partite cluster states formed by two photons in the time and frequency domain, confirming genuine multi-partite entanglement with higher noise robustness compared to conventional two-level cluster states. We perform proof-of-concept high-dimensional one-way quantum operations, where the cluster states are transformed into orthogonal, maximally entangled d-level two-partite states by means of projection measurements.

letter,Even denominator fractional quantum Hall states in higher Landau levels of graphene,"<p>An important development in the field of the fractional quantum Hall effect was the proposal that the 5/2 state observed in the Landau level with orbital index n&#8201;=&#8201;1 of two-dimensional electrons in a GaAs quantum well originates from a chiral p-wave paired state of composite fermions that are topological bound states of electrons and quantized vortices. The excitations of this state, which is theoretically described by a &#8216;Pfaffian&#8217; wavefunction or its hole partner called the anti-Pfaffian, are neither fermions nor bosons but Majorana quasiparticles obeying non-Abelian braid statistics. This has inspired ideas for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation and has also instigated a search for other states with exotic quasiparticles. Here we report experiments on monolayer graphene that show clear evidence for unexpected even denominator fractional quantum Hall physics in the n&#8201;=&#8201;3 Landau level. We numerically investigate the known candidate states for the even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect, including the Pfaffian, the particle&#8211;hole symmetric Pfaffian and the 221-parton states, and conclude that, among these, the 221-parton appears a potentially suitable candidate to describe the experimentally observed state.

article,On the complexity and verification of quantum random circuit sampling,"<p>A critical milestone on the path to useful quantum computers is the demonstration of a quantum computation that is prohibitively hard for classical computers&#8212;a task referred to as quantum supremacy. A leading near-term candidate is sampling from the probability distributions of randomly chosen quantum circuits, which we call random circuit sampling (RCS). RCS was defined with experimental realizations in mind, leaving its computational hardness unproven. Here we give strong complexity-theoretic evidence of classical hardness of RCS, placing it on par with the best theoretical proposals for supremacy. Specifically, we show that RCS satisfies an average-case hardness condition, which is critical to establishing computational hardness in the presence of experimental noise. In addition, it follows from known results that RCS also satisfies an anti-concentration property, namely that errors in estimating output probabilities are small with respect to the probabilities themselves. This makes RCS the first proposal for quantum supremacy with both of these properties. Finally, we also give a natural condition under which an existing statistical measure, cross-entropy, verifies RCS, as well as describe a new verification measure that in some formal sense maximizes the information gained from experimental samples.</p>",[],False,"[""Adam Bouland"", ""Bill Fefferman"", ""Chinmay Nirkhe"", ""Umesh Vazirani""]","Bouland, A., Fefferman, B., Nirkhe, C. et al.

article,Signatures of the many-body localized regime in two dimensions,"<p>Lessons from Anderson localization highlight the importance of the dimensionality of real space for localization due to disorder. More recently, studies of many-body localization have focused on the phenomenon in one dimension using techniques of exact diagonalization and tensor networks. On the other hand, experiments in two dimensions have provided concrete results going beyond the previously numerically accessible limits while posing several challenging questions. We present the large-scale numerical examination of a disordered Bose&#8211;Hubbard model in two dimensions realized in cold atoms, which shows entanglement-based signatures of many-body localization. By generalizing a low-depth quantum circuit to two dimensions, we approximate eigenstates in the experimental parameter regimes for large systems, which is beyond the scope of exact diagonalization. A careful analysis of the eigenstate entanglement structure provides an indication of the putative phase transition marked by a peak in the fluctuations of entanglement entropy in a parameter range consistent with experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Thorsten B.

article,Complete reconstruction of bound and unbound electronic wavefunctions in two-photon double ionization,"<p>To be complete, the characterization of the photoionization process of atoms and molecules requires the extraction of all quantum-mechanical phases and amplitudes. So far, complete experiments have accessed only the ionization process of neutral atoms and molecules. Here we report the quantum-mechanically complete characterization of the single and double ionization of neon to yield doubly charged ions. The first ionization step by intense, polarized extreme ultraviolet light from a free-electron laser leaves the ion in a polarized state (that is, one in which the angular momentum of the ion is aligned in space). By controlling the polarization of the light, we determine the bound and continuum components of the system in the first and second ionization steps leading to the formation of doubly charged neon ions. We test the validity of our approach by characterizing the influence of autoionizing ionic states on the two-photon double-ionization mechanism.

article,Dynamic interdependence and competition in multilayer networks,"<p>From critical infrastructure to physiology and the human brain, complex systems rarely occur in isolation. Instead, the functioning of nodes in one system often promotes or suppresses the functioning of nodes in another. Structural interdependence&#8212;that is, when the functionality of the nodes is determined exclusively by connectivity between layers&#8212;can be characterized via percolation processes on interdependent networks. However, modelling more general interactions between dynamical systems has remained an open problem. Here, we present a dynamic dependency framework that can capture interdependent and competitive interactions between dynamic systems, which we use to study synchronization and spreading processes in multilayer networks with interacting layers. By developing a mean-field theory, which we verify by simulations, we find coupled collective phenomena, including multistability, regions of coexistence, and macroscopic chaos. In interdependent dynamics, in particular, we observe hysteretic behaviours with abrupt (hybrid and explosive) transitions, that exhibit universal features that match those emerging from interdependent percolation. This dynamic dependency framework provides a powerful tool with which to improve our understanding of many of the interacting complex systems surrounding us.</p>",[],False,"[""Michael M.

article,Magneto-transport controlled by Landau polariton states,"<p>Hybrid excitations, called polaritons, emerge in systems with strong light&#8211;matter coupling. Usually, they dominate the linear and nonlinear optical properties with applications in quantum optics. Here, we show the crucial role of the electronic component of polaritons in the magneto-transport of a cavity-embedded two-dimensional electron gas in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that the linear direct-current resistivity is substantially modified by the coupling to the cavity even without external irradiation. Our observations confirm recent predictions of vacuum-induced modification of the resistivity. Furthermore, photo-assisted transport in the presence of a weak irradiation field at sub-terahertz frequencies highlights the different roles of localized and delocalized states.</p>",[],False,"[""Gian L.

article,Field-induced phase coexistence in an artificial spin ice,"<p>Artificial spin-ice systems are magnetic metamaterials consisting of nanomagnet arrays that can be designed to study exotic magnetic states not found in natural materials. Typically, these arrays are modelled as interacting binary macrospins that can only be in an up or down state and are described by the Ising model. These materials have demonstrated ordering transitions, but only via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. We have designed and studied a quadrupole artificial spin-ice system consisting of interacting plaquettes of coupled single-domain nanomagnets that can be interpreted as a composite, ternary variable. After annealing this system in an external magnetic field, we observe both a ferroquadrupolar and an antiferroquadrupolar phase, with an apparent first-order phase boundary and a coexistence regime. The phase diagram of this material is reminiscent of a model used to describe phase coexistence in the superfluid transition of <sup>4</sup>He with <sup>3</sup>He impurities. These results illustrate how composite magnetic objects realize exotic statistical physics models beyond the Ising model.</p>",[],False,"[""Joseph Sklenar"", ""Yuyang Lao"", ""Alan Albrecht"", ""Justin D.
