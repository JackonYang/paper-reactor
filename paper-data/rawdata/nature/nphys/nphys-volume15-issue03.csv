letter,Creation of quark–gluon plasma droplets with three distinct geometries,"<p>Experimental studies of the collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic energies have established the properties of the quark&#8211;gluon plasma (QGP), a state of hot, dense nuclear matter in which quarks and gluons are not bound into hadrons. In this state, matter behaves as a nearly inviscid fluid that efficiently translates initial spatial anisotropies into correlated momentum anisotropies among the particles produced, creating a common velocity field pattern known as collective flow. In recent years, comparable momentum anisotropies have been measured in small-system proton&#8211;proton (p+p) and proton&#8211;nucleus (p+A) collisions, despite expectations that the volume and lifetime of the medium produced would be too small to form a QGP. Here we report on the observation of elliptic and triangular flow patterns of charged particles produced in proton&#8211;gold (p+Au), deuteron&#8211;gold (d+Au) and helium&#8211;gold (<sup>3</sup>He+Au) collisions at a nucleon&#8211;nucleon centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt {s_{{\mathrm{NN}}}}\)&#8201;=&#8201;200&#8201;GeV. The unique combination of three distinct initial geometries and two flow patterns provides unprecedented model discrimination. Hydrodynamical models, which include the formation of a short-lived QGP droplet, provide the best simultaneous description of these measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""C. Aidala"", ""Y. Akiba"", ""M.

letter,Entanglement of single-photons and chiral phonons in atomically thin WSe2,"<p>Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon that, on the one hand, reveals deep connections between quantum mechanics, gravity and spacetime, and on the other hand, has practical applications as a key resource in quantum information processing. Although it is routinely achieved in photon&#8211;atom ensembles, entanglement involving solid-state or macroscopic objects remains challenging albeit promising for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Here, we report entanglement between collective, chiral vibrations in a two-dimensional WSe<sub>2</sub> host&#8212;chiral phonons (CPs)&#8212;and single-photons emitted from quantum dots (QDs) present in it. CPs that carry angular momentum were recently observed in WSe<sub>2</sub> and are a distinguishing feature of the underlying honeycomb lattice. The entanglement results from a &#8216;which-way&#8217; scattering process, involving an optical excitation in a QD and doubly-degenerate CPs, which takes place via two indistinguishable paths. Our unveiling of entanglement involving a macroscopic, collective excitation together with strong interactions between CPs and QDs in two-dimensional materials opens up ways for phonon-driven entanglement of QDs and engineering chiral or non-reciprocal interactions at the single-photon level.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaotong Chen"", ""Xin Lu"", ""Sudipta Dubey"", ""Qiang Yao"", ""Sheng Liu"", ""Xingzhi Wang"", ""Qihua Xiong"", ""Lifa Zhang"", ""Ajit Srivastava""]","Chen, X., Lu, X., Dubey, S. et al.

letter,Exchange-driven intravalley mixing of excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides,"<p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors for application in optoelectronics. Their optical properties are dominated by two series of photo-excited exciton states&#8212;A (XA) and B (XB)&#8212;that are derived from direct interband transitions near the band extrema. These exciton states have large binding energies and strong optical absorption, and form an ideal system to investigate many-body effects in low dimensions. Because spin&#8211;orbit coupling causes a large splitting between bands of opposite spins, XA and XB are usually treated as spin-polarized Ising excitons, each arising from interactions within a specific set of states induced by interband transitions between pairs of either spin-up or spin-down bands (TA or TB). Here, by using monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> as a prototypical system and solving the first-principles Bethe&#8211;Salpeter equations, we demonstrate a strong intravalley exchange interaction between TA and TB, indicating that XA and XB are mixed states instead of pure Ising excitons. Using 2D electronic spectroscopy, we observe that an optical excitation of the lower-energy TA induces a population of the higher-energy TB, manifesting the intravalley exchange interaction. This work elucidates the dynamics of exciton formation in monolayer TMDCs, and sheds light on many-body effects in 2D materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Liang Guo"", ""Meng Wu"", ""Ting Cao"", ""Daniele M.

letter,Collective energy gap of preformed Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors,"<p>In most superconductors, the transition to the superconducting state is driven by the binding of electrons into Cooper pairs. The condensation of these pairs into a single, phase-coherent, quantum state takes place at the same time as their formation at the transition temperature, T<sub>c</sub>. A different scenario occurs in some disordered, amorphous, superconductors: instead of a pairing-driven transition, incoherent Cooper pairs first preform above T<sub>c</sub>, causing the opening of a pseudogap, and then, at T<sub>c</sub>, condense into the phase-coherent superconducting state. Such a two-step scenario implies the existence of a new energy scale, &#916;<sub>c</sub>, driving the collective superconducting transition of the preformed pairs. Here we unveil this energy scale by means of Andreev spectroscopy in superconducting thin films of amorphous indium oxide. We observe two Andreev conductance peaks at &#177;&#916;<sub>c</sub> that develop only below T<sub>c</sub> and for highly disordered films on the verge of the transition to insulator. Our findings demonstrate that amorphous superconducting films provide prototypical disordered quantum systems to explore the collective superfluid transition of preformed Cooper pairs.</p>",[],False,"[""Thomas Dubouchet"", ""Benjamin Sac\u00e9p\u00e9"", ""Johanna Seidemann"", ""Dan Shahar"", ""Marc Sanquer"", ""Claude Chapelier""]","Dubouchet, T., Sacépé, B., Seidemann, J. et al.

letter,Evidence of a gate-tunable Mott insulator in a trilayer graphene moiré superlattice,"<p>The Mott insulator is a central concept in strongly correlated physics and manifests when the repulsive Coulomb interaction between electrons dominates over their kinetic energy. Doping additional carriers into a Mott insulator can give rise to other correlated phenomena such as unusual magnetism and even high-temperature superconductivity. A tunable Mott insulator, where the competition between the Coulomb interaction and the kinetic energy can be varied in situ, can provide an invaluable model system for the study of Mott physics. Here we report the possible realization of such a tunable Mott insulator in a trilayer graphene heterostructure with a moir&#233; superlattice. The combination of the cubic energy dispersion in ABC-stacked trilayer graphene and the narrow electronic minibands induced by the moir&#233; potential leads to the observation of insulating states at the predicted band fillings for the Mott insulator. Moreover, the insulating states in the heterostructure can be tuned: the bandgap can be modulated by a vertical electrical field, and at the same time the electron doping can be modified by a gate to fill the band from one insulating state to another. This opens up exciting opportunities to explore strongly correlated phenomena in two-dimensional moir&#233; superlattice heterostructures.</p>",[],False,"[""Guorui Chen"", ""Lili Jiang"", ""Shuang Wu"", ""Bosai Lyu"", ""Hongyuan Li"", ""Bheema Lingam Chittari"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Zhiwen Shi"", ""Jeil Jung"", ""Yuanbo Zhang"", ""Feng Wang""]","Chen, G., Jiang, L., Wu, S. et al.

letter,Quantum interference in second-harmonic generation from monolayer WSe2,"<p>A hallmark of wave&#8211;matter duality is the emergence of quantum-interference phenomena when an electronic transition follows different trajectories. This type of interference results in asymmetric absorption lines such as Fano resonances, and gives rise to secondary effects such as electromagnetically induced transparency when multiple optical transitions are pumped. Few solid-state systems show quantum interference and electromagnetically induced transparency, with quantum-well intersubband transitions in the infrared region offering the most promising avenue to date to devices exploiting optical gain without inversion. Quantum interference is usually hampered by inhomogeneous broadening of electronic transitions, making it challenging to achieve in solids at visible wavelengths and elevated temperatures. However, disorder effects can be mitigated by raising the oscillator strength of atom-like electronic transitions&#8212;excitons&#8212;that arise in monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides. Quantum interference, probed by second-harmonic generation, emerges in monolayer WSe<sub>2</sub>, without a cavity, to split the frequency-doubled laser spectrum.

letter,Highly efficient double ionization of mixed alkali dimers by intermolecular Coulombic decay,"<p>As opposed to purely molecular systems where electron dynamics proceed only through intramolecular processes, weakly bound complexes such as He droplets offer an environment where local excitations can interact with neighbouring embedded molecules leading to new intermolecular relaxation mechanisms. Here, we report on a new decay mechanism leading to the double ionization of alkali dimers attached to He droplets by intermolecular energy transfer. From the electron spectra, the process is similar to the well-known shake-off mechanism observed in double Auger decay and single-photon double ionization, however, in this case, the process is dominant, occurring with efficiencies equal to, or greater than, single ionization by energy transfer. Although an alkali dimer attached to a He droplet is a model case, the decay mechanism is relevant for any system where the excitation energy of one constituent exceeds the double ionization potential of another neighbouring molecule. The process is, in particular, relevant for biological systems, where radicals and slow electrons are known to cause radiation damage.</p>",[],False,"[""A. C. LaForge"", ""M. Shcherbinin"", ""F.

letter,Emergence of three-dimensional order and structure in growing biofilms,"<p>Surface-attached bacterial biofilms are self-replicating active liquid crystals and the dominant form of bacterial life on Earth. In conventional liquid crystals and solid-state materials, the interaction potentials between the molecules that comprise the system determine the material properties. However, for growth-active biofilms it is unclear whether potential-based descriptions can account for the experimentally observed morphologies, and which potentials would be relevant. Here, we have overcome previous limitations of single-cell imaging techniques to reconstruct and track all individual cells inside growing three-dimensional biofilms with up to 10,000 individuals. Based on these data, we identify, constrain and provide a microscopic basis for an effective cell&#8211;cell interaction potential, which captures and predicts the growth dynamics, emergent architecture and local liquid-crystalline order of Vibrio cholerae biofilms. Furthermore, we show how external fluid flows control the microscopic structure and three-dimensional morphology of biofilms. Our analysis implies that local cellular order and global biofilm architecture in these active bacterial communities can arise from mechanical cell&#8211;cell interactions, which cells can modulate by regulating the production of particular matrix components. These results establish an experimentally validated foundation for improved continuum theories of active matter and thereby contribute to solving the important problem of controlling biofilm growth.</p>",[],False,"[""Raimo Hartmann"", ""Praveen K.

These global characteristics pertain to the system as a whole and are not locally defined. However, local topological markers can distinguish between topological phases, and they can vary in space. In equilibrium, we show that the topological marker can be used to extract the critical behaviour of topological phase transitions. Out of equilibrium, we show that the topological marker spreads via a flow of currents emanating from the sample boundaries, and with a bounded maximum propagation speed. We discuss the possibilities for measuring the topological marker and its flow in experiment.</p>",[],False,"[""M. D. Caio"", ""G. M\u00f6ller"", ""N. R. Cooper"", ""M. J.

article,Two-dimensional spin liquid behaviour in the triangular-honeycomb antiferromagnet TbInO3,"<p>Spin liquid ground states are predicted to arise within several distinct scenarios in condensed matter physics. The observation of these disordered magnetic states is particularly pervasive among a class of materials known as frustrated magnets, in which the competition between various magnetic exchange interactions prevents the system from adopting long-range magnetic order at low temperatures. Spin liquids continue to be of great interest due to their exotic nature and the possibility that they may support fractionalized excitations, such as Majorana fermions. Systems that allow for such phenomena are not only fascinating from a fundamental perspective but may also be practically significant in future technologies based on quantum computation. Here we show that the underlying antiferromagnetic sublattice in TbInO<sub>3</sub> can undergo a crystal field-induced distortion of its buckled triangular arrangement to one based on a honeycomb. The absence of a conventional magnetic ordering transition at the lowest measurable temperatures indicates that another critical mechanism must govern in the ground-state selection of TbInO<sub>3</sub>. We suggest that anisotropic exchange interactions&#8212;mediated through strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling on the emergent honeycomb lattice of TbInO<sub>3</sub>&#8212;give rise to a highly frustrated spin liquid.</p>",[],False,"[""Lucy Clark"", ""Gabriele Sala"", ""Dalini D.

article,Strain-tunable magnetism at oxide domain walls,"<p>Applying stress to a ferroelastic material results in a nonlinear strain response as domains of different orientations mechanically switch. The ability to write, erase and move domain walls between such ferroelastic domains suggests a method for making nanoelectronics where the domain wall is the device. However, little is known about the magnetic properties of such domain walls. A fascinating model system is SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, where the ferroelastic domain walls display strain-tunable polarity and enhanced conductivity. Here, we reveal a long-range magnetic order with modulations along the ferroelastic domain walls in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>-based heterointerfaces, which manifests itself as a striped pattern in scanning superconducting quantum interference device maps of the magnetic landscape. In conducting interfaces, the magnetism is coupled to itinerant electrons with clear signatures in magnetotransport measurements. The magnetic state is also coupled dynamically to the lattice and can be reversibly tuned by applying local external forces. This study raises the possibility of designing nanoscale devices based on domain walls where strain-tunable ferroelectric, ferroelastic and ferromagnetic orders may coexist.</p>",[],False,"[""D. V.

article,Plasmonic quantum size effects in silver nanoparticles are dominated by interfaces and local environments,"<p>The physical properties of metals change when their dimensions are reduced to the nano-scale and new phenomena such as the localized surface-plasmon resonance (LSPR) appear. This collective electronic excitation can be tuned over a large spectral range by adapting the material, size and shape. The existing literature is as rich as it is controversial&#8212;for example, size-dependent spectral shifts of the LSPR in small metal nanoparticles, induced by quantum effects, are reported to the red, to the blue or entirely absent. Here we report how complementary experiments on size-selected small silver nanoparticles embedded in silica can yield inconsistent results on the same system: whereas optical absorption shows no size effect in the range between only a few atoms and ~10&#8201;nm, a clear spectral shift is observed in single-particle electron spectroscopy. Our quantitative interpretation, based on a mixed classical/quantum model, resolves the apparent contradictions, not only within our experimental data, but also in the literature.

article,Direct observation of ion acceleration from a beam-driven wave in a magnetic fusion experiment,"<p>Efficiently heating a magnetically confined plasma to thermonuclear temperatures remains a central issue in fusion energy research. One well-established technique is to inject beams of neutral particles into the plasma, a process known as neutral beam injection. In the classical picture, fast ions generated from neutral beam injection predominantly heat electrons as they are slowed by friction. This electron heat is then collisionally coupled to the plasma ions, which comprise the fusion fuel. Fast ions can also drive plasma waves, which divert energy from the fuel and can degrade confinement. Here we present new observations from a field reversed configuration plasma in which a beam-driven wave in the open field line region couples directly to fuel ions, drawing a high-energy tail on subcollisional timescales that dramatically enhances the fusion rate. This mode therefore allows the beam energy to bypass the electron channel and does so without having a deleterious effect on global plasma confinement. Our results demonstrate a means of directly and non-destructively coupling energy from fast ions to plasma ions, which may pave the way for improved neutral beam injection heating efficiency or the prevention of ash accumulation with alpha channelling.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

article,The Goldstone mode and resonances in the fluid interfacial region,"<p>The development of a molecular theory of inhomogeneous fluids and, in particular, of the liquid&#8211;gas interface has received enormous interest in recent years; however, long-standing attempts to extend the concept of surface tension in mesoscopic approaches by making it scale dependent, although apparently plausible, have failed to connect with simulation and experimental studies of the interface that probe the detailed properties of density correlations. Here, we show that a fully microscopic theory of correlations in the interfacial region can be developed that overcomes many of the problems associated with simpler mesoscopic ideas. This theory originates from recognizing that the correlation function displays, in addition to a Goldstone mode, an unexpected hierarchy of resonances that constrain severely its structural properties. Indeed, this approach allows us to identify new classes of fully integrable models for which, surprisingly, the tension, density profile and correlation function can all be determined analytically, revealing the microscopic structure of correlations in all generalized van der Waals theories.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Guiding self-organized pattern formation in cell polarity establishment,"<p>Spontaneous pattern formation in Turing systems relies on feedback. But patterns in cells and tissues seldom form spontaneously&#8212;instead they are controlled by regulatory biochemical interactions that provide molecular guiding cues. The relationship between these guiding cues and feedback in controlled biological pattern formation remains unclear. Here, we explore this relationship during cell-polarity establishment in the one-cell-stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. We quantify the strength of two feedback systems that operate during polarity establishment: feedback between polarity proteins and the actomyosin cortex, and mutual antagonism among polarity proteins. We characterize how these feedback systems are modulated by guiding cues from the centrosome, an organelle regulating cell cycle progression. By coupling a mass-conserved Turing-like reaction&#8211;diffusion system for polarity proteins to an active-gel description of the actomyosin cortex, we reveal a transition point beyond which feedback ensures self-organized polarization, even when cues are removed. Notably, the system switches from a guide-dominated to a feedback-dominated regime well beyond this transition point, which ensures robustness. Together, these results reveal a general criterion for controlling biological pattern-forming systems: feedback remains subcritical to avoid unstable behaviour, and molecular guiding cues drive the system beyond a transition point for pattern formation.</p>",[],False,"[""Peter Gross"", ""K.
