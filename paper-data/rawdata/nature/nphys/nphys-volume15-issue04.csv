letter,Interplay between nuclear shell evolution and shape deformation revealed by the magnetic moment of 75Cu,"<p>Exotic nuclei are characterized by having a number of neutrons (or protons) in excess relative to stable nuclei. Their shell structure, which represents single-particle motion in a nucleus, may vary due to nuclear force and excess neutrons, in a phenomenon called shell evolution. This effect could be counterbalanced by collective modes causing deformations of the nuclear surface. Here, we study the interplay between shell evolution and shape deformation by focusing on the magnetic moment of an isomeric state of the neutron-rich nucleus <sup>75</sup>Cu. We measure the magnetic moment using highly spin-controlled rare-isotope beams and achieve large spin alignment via a two-step reaction scheme that incorporates an angular-momentum-selecting nucleon removal. By combining our experiments with numerical simulations of many-fermion correlations, we find that the low-lying states in <sup>75</sup>Cu are, to a large extent, of single-particle nature on top of a correlated <sup>74</sup>Ni core. We elucidate the crucial role of shell evolution even in the presence of the collective mode, and within the same framework we consider whether and how the double magicity of the <sup>78</sup>Ni nucleus is restored, which is also of keen interest from the perspective of nucleosynthesis in explosive stellar processes.</p>",,"[{'address': 'RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, Wako, Saitama, Japan', 'authors': ['Y.

letter,Quantum stochastic resonance in an a.c.-driven single-electron quantum dot,"<p>In stochastic resonance, the combination of a weak signal with noise leads to its amplification and optimization. This phenomenon has been observed in several systems in contexts ranging from palaeoclimatology, biology, medicine, sociology and economics to physics. In all these cases, the systems were either operating in the presence of thermal noise or were exposed to external classical noise sources. For quantum-mechanical systems, it has been theoretically predicted that intrinsic fluctuations lead to stochastic resonance as well, a phenomenon referred to as quantum stochastic resonance, but this has not been reported experimentally so far. Here we demonstrate tunnelling-controlled quantum stochastic resonance in the a.c.-driven charging and discharging of single electrons on a quantum dot. By analysing the counting statistics, we demonstrate that synchronization between the sequential tunnelling processes and a periodic driving signal passes through an optimum, irrespective of whether the external frequency or the internal tunnel coupling is tuned.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut für Festkörperphysik, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hanover, Germany', 'authors': ['Timo Wagner', ',\xa0Johannes C.

letter,Evolution of charge order topology across a magnetic phase transition in cuprate superconductors,"<p>Charge order is now accepted as an integral constituent of cuprate high-temperature superconductors, one that is intimately related to other electronic instabilities including antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. Unlike conventional Peierls density waves, the charge correlations in cuprates have been predicted to display a rich momentum space topology depending on the underlying fermiology. However, charge order has only been observed along the high-symmetry Cu&#8211;O bond directions. Here, using resonant soft X-ray scattering, we investigate the evolution of the full momentum space topology of charge correlations in T&#8242;-(Nd,Pr)<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> as a function of electron doping. We report that, when the parent Mott insulator is doped, charge correlations first emerge with full rotational symmetry in momentum space, indicating glassy charge density modulation in real space possibly seeded by local defects. At higher doping levels, the orientation of charge correlations is locked to the Cu&#8211;O bond directions, restoring a more conventional long-ranged bidirectional charge order. Through charge susceptibility calculations, we reproduce the evolution in topology of charge correlations across the antiferromagnetic phase boundary and propose a revised phase diagram of T&#8242;-Ln<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> with a superconducting region extending toward the Mott limit.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Mingu Kang', ',\xa0Jonathan Pelliciari', '\xa0&\xa0Riccardo Comin']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Alex Frano', ',\xa0Nicholas Breznay', ',\xa0Mo Chen', ',\xa0Keto Zhang', ',\xa0Alejandro Ruiz', ',\xa0Zeyu Hao', ',\xa0Sylvia Lewin', '\xa0&\xa0James Analytis']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Alex Frano']}, {'address': 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie, Berlin, Germany', 'authors': ['Enrico Schierle', '\xa0&\xa0Eugen Weschke']}, {'address': 'Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada', 'authors': ['Ronny Sutarto', '\xa0&\xa0Feizhou He']}, {'address': 'Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Padraic Shafer', '\xa0&\xa0Elke Arenholz']}, {'address': 'NTT Basic Research Laboratories, NTT corporation, Atsugi, Japan', 'authors': ['Yoshiharu Krockenberger', '\xa0&\xa0Hideki Yamamoto']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India', 'authors': ['Tanmoy Das']}]",False,"['Mingu Kang', 'Jonathan Pelliciari', 'Alex Frano', 'Nicholas Breznay', 'Enrico Schierle', 'Eugen Weschke', 'Ronny Sutarto', 'Feizhou He', 'Padraic Shafer', 'Elke Arenholz', 'Mo Chen', 'Keto Zhang', 'Alejandro Ruiz', 'Zeyu Hao', 'Sylvia Lewin', 'James Analytis', 'Yoshiharu Krockenberger', 'Hideki Yamamoto', 'Tanmoy Das', 'Riccardo Comin']","Kang, M., Pelliciari, J., Frano, A. et al.

By tuning a sum-frequency excitation process, we selectively trigger collective excitations that can be ascribed to the relative phase fluctuations between two superconducting order parameters&#8212;the so-called Leggett mode&#8212;in the multiband superconductor MgB<sub>2</sub>.

letter,Far out-of-equilibrium spin populations trigger giant spin injection into atomically thin MoS2,"<p>Injecting spins from ferromagnetic metals into semiconductors efficiently is a crucial step towards the seamless integration of charge- and spin-information processing in a single device. However, efficient spin injection into semiconductors has remained an elusive challenge even after almost three decades of major scientific effort, due to, for example, the extremely low injection efficiencies originating from impedance mismatch, or technological challenges originating from stability and the costs of the approaches. We show here that, by utilizing the strongly out-of-equilibrium nature of subpicosecond spin-current pulses, we can obtain a massive spin transfer even across a bare ferromagnet/semiconductor interface. We demonstrate this by producing ultrashort spin-polarized current pulses in Co and injecting them into monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>, a two-dimensional semiconductor. The MoS<sub>2</sub> layer acts both as the receiver of the spin injection and as a selective converter of the spin current into a charge current, whose terahertz emission is then measured. Strikingly, we measure a giant spin current, orders of magnitude larger than typical injected spin-current densities using currently available techniques. Our result demonstrates that technologically relevant spin currents do not require the very strong excitations typically associated with femtosecond lasers. Rather, they can be driven by ultralow-intensity laser pulses, finally enabling ultrashort spin-current pulses to be a technologically viable information carrier for terahertz spintronics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Physics and Applied Physics, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Liang Cheng', ',\xa0Xinbo Wang', ',\xa0Xiaoxuan Chen', ',\xa0Handong Sun', ',\xa0Justin C.

letter,Acoustic Landau quantization and quantum-Hall-like edge states,"<p>Many intriguing phenomena occur for electrons under strong magnetic fields. Recently, it was shown that an appropriate strain texture in graphene could induce a synthetic gauge field, in which electrons behave as they do in a real magnetic field. This enabled the control of quantum transport by mechanical means and allowed the unreached high-field regime to be explored. Such synthetic gauge fields have been achieved in molecular and photonic lattices. Here we report an experimental realization of a giant uniform pseudomagnetic field in acoustics by introducing a simple uniaxial deformation to the acoustic graphene. The controllability of our macroscopic platform enables us to observe the acoustic Landau levels in frequency-resolved spectroscopy and their spatial localization in pressure-field distributions. We further visualize the quantum-Hall-like edge states (connected to the zeroth Landau level), which have been elusive owing to the difficulty in creating large-area uniform pseudomagnetic fields. These results, consistent with our full-wave simulations, establish a complete framework for artificial structures under constant pseudomagnetic fields.

letter,Axial-field-induced chiral channels in an acoustic Weyl system,"<p>Condensed-matter and other engineered systems, such as cold atoms, photonic or phononic metamaterials, have proved to be versatile platforms for the observation of low-energy counterparts of elementary particles from relativistic field theories. These include the celebrated Majorana modes, as well as Dirac and Weyl fermions. An intriguing feature of the Weyl equation is the chiral symmetry, where the two chiral sectors have an independent gauge freedom. Although this freedom leads to a quantum anomaly, there is no corresponding axial background field coupling differently to opposite chiralities in quantum electrodynamics. Here, we provide the experimental characterization of the effect of such an axial field in an acoustic metamaterial. We implement the axial field through an inhomogeneous potential and observe the induced chiral Landau levels. From the metamaterials perspective these chiral channels open the possibility for the observation of non-local Weyl orbits and might enable unidirectional bulk transport in a time-reversal-invariant system.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland', 'authors': ['Valerio Peri', ',\xa0Marc Serra-Garcia', '\xa0&\xa0Sebastian D.

letter,Selection mechanism at the onset of active turbulence,"<p>Active turbulence describes a flow regime that is erratic, and yet endowed with a characteristic length scale. It arises in animate soft-matter systems as diverse as bacterial baths, cell tissues and reconstituted cytoskeletal preparations. However, the way that these turbulent dynamics emerge in active systems has so far evaded experimental scrutiny. Here, we unveil a direct route to active nematic turbulence by demonstrating that, for radially aligned unconfined textures, the characteristic length scale emerges at the early stages of the instability. We resolve two-dimensional distortions of a microtubule-based extensile system in space and time, and show that they can be characterized in terms of a growth rate that exhibits quadratic dependence on a dominant wavenumber. This wavelength selection mechanism is justified on the basis of a continuum model for an active nematic including viscous coupling to the adjacent fluid phase. Our findings are in line with the classical pattern-formation studies in non-active systems, bettering our understanding of the principles of active self-organization, and providing potential perspectives for the control of biological fluids.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Departament de Ciència dels Materials i Química Física, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain', 'authors': ['Berta Martínez-Prat', ',\xa0Jordi Ignés-Mullol', '\xa0&\xa0Francesc Sagués']}, {'address': 'Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain', 'authors': ['Berta Martínez-Prat', ',\xa0Jordi Ignés-Mullol', '\xa0&\xa0Francesc Sagués']}, {'address': 'Departament de Física de la Matèria Condensada, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain', 'authors': ['Jaume Casademunt']}, {'address': 'Universitat de Barcelona Institute of Complex Systems (UBICS), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain', 'authors': ['Jaume Casademunt']}]",False,"['Berta Martínez-Prat', 'Jordi Ignés-Mullol', 'Jaume Casademunt', 'Francesc Sagués']","Martínez-Prat, B., Ignés-Mullol, J., Casademunt, J. et al.

letter,Plasmaspheric hiss waves generate a reversed energy spectrum of radiation belt electrons,"<p>Highly energetic electrons are trapped in the magnetic field of Earth&#8217;s radiation belts. The physical mechanisms driving the dynamics of the Van Allen belts can be understood from the electron&#8217;s energy spectrum, which is believed to be steeply falling with increasing energy. This view has been prevalent for the past 60 years since the energy spectra were first measured. Here, we report the observation of a reversed energy spectrum with abundant high-energy and fewer low-energy electrons spanning from hundreds of keV to around two MeV in electron energy in data collected with NASA&#8217;s Van Allen Probes. We find that this spectrum dominates inside the plasmasphere&#8212;a dense cold plasma region co-rotating with the Earth. Using two-dimensional Fokker&#8211;Planck diffusion simulations with a time-dependent, data-driven model of hiss waves in the plasmasphere, we demonstrate that the formation of the reversed spectrum is explained by the scattering of hiss waves.

article,Chip-integrated visible–telecom entangled photon pair source for quantum communication,"<p>Photon pair sources are fundamental building blocks for quantum entanglement and quantum communication. Recent studies in silicon photonics have documented promising characteristics for photon pair sources within the telecommunications band, including sub-milliwatt optical pump power, high spectral brightness and high photon purity. However, most quantum systems suitable for local operations, such as storage and computation, support optical transitions in the visible or short near-infrared bands. In comparison to telecommunications wavelengths, the higher optical attenuation in silica at such wavelengths limits the length scale over which optical-fibre-based quantum communication between such local nodes can take place. One approach to connect such systems over fibre is through a photon pair source that can bridge the visible and telecom bands, but an appropriate source, which should produce narrow-band photon pairs with a high signal-to-noise ratio, has not yet been developed in an integrated platform. Here, we demonstrate a nanophotonic visible&#8211;telecom photon pair source, using high quality factor silicon nitride resonators to generate narrow-band photon pairs with unprecedented purity and brightness, with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 3,780&#8201;&#177;&#8201;140 and a detected photon pair flux up to (18,400&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1,000)&#8201;pairs&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. We further demonstrate visible&#8211;telecom time&#8211;energy entanglement and its distribution over a 20&#8201;km fibre, far exceeding the fibre length over which purely visible wavelength quantum light sources can be efficiently transmitted. Finally, we show how dispersion engineering of the microresonators enables the connections of different species of trapped atoms/ions, defect centres and quantum dots to the telecommunications bands for future quantum communication systems.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Microsystems and Nanotechnology Division, Physical Measurement Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA', 'authors': ['Xiyuan Lu', ',\xa0Qing Li', ',\xa0Daron A.

This is in contradiction to the existence of chiral molecules&#8212;a fact known as as the Hund paradox. The origin of molecular and biological chirality is conjectured to be related to parity-breaking interactions or environmental decoherence, but a quantum superposition of two chiral molecular states with distinctive optical activities has never been observed. To make progress in addressing these questions, it would be helpful to construct an artificial quantum system that breaks the parity symmetry and that can be prepared in a superposition of two chiral states. Here we report the synthesis of the parity-breaking antisymmetric spin exchange interaction in all-to-all connected superconducting circuits, which allows us to show various chiral spin dynamics in up to five-spin clusters. We also demonstrate the entanglement of up to five qubits in Greenberger&#8211;Horne&#8211;Zeilinger states based on a three-spin chiral logic gate.

article,Large-scale curvature sensing by directional actin flow drives cellular migration mode switching,"<p>Cell migration over heterogeneous substrates during wound healing or morphogenetic processes leads to shape changes driven by different organizations of the actin cytoskeleton and by functional changes including lamellipodial protrusions and contractile actin cables. Cells distinguish between cell-sized positive and negative curvatures in their physical environment by forming protrusions at positive curvatures and actin cables at negative curvatures; however, the cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that concave edges promote polarized actin structures with actin flow directed towards the cell edge, in contrast to well-documented retrograde flow at convex edges. Anterograde flow and contractility induce a tension anisotropy gradient. A polarized actin network is formed, accompanied by a local polymerization&#8211;depolymerization gradient, together with leading-edge contractile actin cables in the front. These cables extend onto non-adherent regions while still maintaining contact with the substrate through focal adhesions. The contraction and dynamic reorganization of this actin structure allows forward movements enabling cell migration over non-adherent regions on the substrate. These versatile functional structures may help cells sense and navigate their environment by adapting to external geometric and mechanical cues.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Tianchi Chen', ',\xa0Hui Ting Ong', ',\xa0Yusuke Toyama', ',\xa0Boon Chuan Low', '\xa0&\xa0Benoît Ladoux']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, UMR 7057, CNRS and Université Paris Diderot, Paris, France', 'authors': ['Andrew Callan-Jones']}, {'address': 'Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel', 'authors': ['Eduard Fedorov', '\xa0&\xa0Tom Shemesh']}, {'address': 'Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering, Schools of Engineering, Medicine and Biological Sciences, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile', 'authors': ['Andrea Ravasio']}, {'address': 'Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Agustí Brugués', '\xa0&\xa0Xavier Trepat']}, {'address': 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Yusuke Toyama', '\xa0&\xa0Boon Chuan Low']}, {'address': 'Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Yusuke Toyama']}, {'address': 'Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red en Bioingeniería, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), and Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain', 'authors': ['Xavier Trepat']}, {'address': 'Laboratoire Jean Perrin and Laboratoire de Physique Theorique de la Matiere Condensee, CNRS / Sorbonne Université, Paris, France', 'authors': ['Raphaël Voituriez']}, {'address': 'Institut Jacques Monod (IJM), CNRS UMR 7592 & Université Paris Diderot, Paris, France', 'authors': ['Benoît Ladoux']}]",False,"['Tianchi Chen', 'Andrew Callan-Jones', 'Eduard Fedorov', 'Andrea Ravasio', 'Agustí Brugués', 'Hui Ting Ong', 'Yusuke Toyama', 'Boon Chuan Low', 'Xavier Trepat', 'Tom Shemesh', 'Raphaël Voituriez', 'Benoît Ladoux']","Chen, T., Callan-Jones, A., Fedorov, E. et al.

article,Spatiotemporal signal propagation in complex networks,"<p>A major achievement in the study of complex networks is the realization that diverse systems, from sub-cellular biology to social networks, exhibit universal topological characteristics. Yet, such universality does not naturally translate to the dynamics of these systems, as dynamic behaviour cannot be uniquely predicted from topology alone. Rather, it depends on the interplay of the network&#8217;s topology with the dynamic mechanisms of interaction between the nodes. Hence, systems with similar structure may exhibit profoundly different dynamic behaviour. We therefore seek a general theoretical framework to help us systematically translate topological elements into their predicted dynamic outcome. Here, we offer such a translation in the context of signal propagation, linking the topology of a network to the observed spatiotemporal spread of perturbative signals across it, thus capturing the network&#8217;s role in propagating local information. For a range of nonlinear dynamic models, we predict that the propagation rules condense into three highly distinctive dynamic regimes, characterized by the interplay between network paths, degree distribution and the interaction dynamics. As a result, classifying a system&#8217;s intrinsic interaction mechanisms into the relevant dynamic regime allows us to systematically translate topology into dynamic patterns of information propagation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Mathematics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel', 'authors': ['Chittaranjan Hens', ',\xa0Uzi Harush', ',\xa0Simi Haber', ',\xa0Reuven Cohen', '\xa0&\xa0Baruch Barzel']}, {'address': 'Physics and Applied Mathematics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India', 'authors': ['Chittaranjan Hens']}]",False,"['Chittaranjan Hens', 'Uzi Harush', 'Simi Haber', 'Reuven Cohen', 'Baruch Barzel']","Hens, C., Harush, U., Haber, S. et al.
