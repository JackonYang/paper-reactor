letter,A primary radiation standard based on quantum nonlinear optics,"<p>The black body remains the most prominent source of light for absolute radiometry. Its main alternative, synchrotron radiation, requires costly and large facilities. Quantum optics offers a new radiometric source: parametric down-conversion (PDC), a nonlinear optical process, in which pairwise photon correlations enable absolute calibration of photodetectors. Since the emission rate crucially depends on the brightness of the electromagnetic field, quantum-mechanical fluctuations of the vacuum can be seen as a seed of spontaneous PDC, and their amplitude is a natural radiometric standard. Thus, they allow for the calibration of the spectral radiance of light sources by measuring the ratio between seeded and unseeded PDC. Here, we directly use the frequency spectrum of the electromagnetic vacuum to trigger spontaneous PDC and employ the generated light to infer the spectral response of a spectrometer over a broad spectral range. Then, we deduce the absolute quantum efficiency from the spectral shape of PDC in the high-gain regime, without relying on a seed or reference detector. Our results compare well with the ones obtained with a reference lamp, demonstrating a promising primary radiation standard.</p>",[],False,"[""Samuel Lemieux"", ""Enno Giese"", ""Robert Fickler"", ""Maria V.

letter,Broadband Lamb shift in an engineered quantum system,"<p>The shift of the energy levels of a quantum system owing to broadband electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations&#8212;the Lamb shift&#8212;has been central for the development of quantum electrodynamics and for the understanding of atomic spectra. Identifying the origin of small energy shifts is still important for engineered quantum systems, in light of the extreme precision required for applications such as quantum computing. However, it is challenging to resolve the Lamb shift in its original broadband case in the absence of a tuneable environment. Consequently, previous observations<sup>,</sup> in non-atomic systems are limited to environments comprising narrowband modes. Here, we observe a broadband Lamb shift in high-quality superconducting resonators, a scenario also accessing static shifts inaccessible in Lamb&#8217;s experiment. We measure a continuous change of several megahertz in the fundamental resonator frequency by externally tuning the coupling strength to the engineered broadband environment, which is based on hybrid normal-metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;superconductor tunnel junctions.

letter,Stern–Gerlach detection of neutral-atom qubits in a state-dependent optical lattice,"<p>Qubit state measurements are an essential part of any quantum computer, constituting the readout. Accurate measurements are also an integral component of one-way quantum computation and of error correction, which is needed for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we present a state measurement for neutral-atom qubits based on coherent spatial splitting of the atoms&#8217; wavefunctions. It is reminiscent of the Stern&#8211;Gerlach experiment, but carried out in light traps. For around 160 qubits in a three-dimensional array, we achieve a measurement fidelity of 0.9994, which is roughly 20 times lower error than in previous measurements of neutral-atom arrays. It also greatly exceeds the measurement fidelity of other arrays with more than four qubits, including those with ion and superconducting qubits. Our measurement fidelity is essentially independent of the number of qubits measured, and since the measurement causes no loss, we can reuse the atoms. We also demonstrate that we can replace atoms lost to background gas collisions during the experiment.</p>",[],False,"[""Tsung-Yao Wu"", ""Aishwarya Kumar"", ""Felipe Giraldo"", ""David S.

letter,Chiral exchange drag and chirality oscillations in synthetic antiferromagnets,"<p>Long-range interactions between quasiparticles give rise to a &#8216;drag&#8217; that affects the fundamental properties of many systems in condensed matter physics. Drag typically involves the exchange of linear momentum between quasiparticles and strongly influences their transport properties. Here, we describe a kind of drag that involves the exchange of angular momentum between two current-driven magnetic domain walls. The motions of the domain walls are correlated and determined by the strength of the drag. When the drag is below a threshold value, the domain walls move together at a constant intermediate velocity with a steady leakage of angular momentum from the faster to the slower wall. However, we find that when the drag exceeds a threshold value, a different dynamic can take place in which the faster domain wall&#8217;s magnetization oscillates synchronously with a precessional motion of the slower domain wall&#8217;s magnetization, and angular momentum is continuously transferred between them. Our findings demonstrate a method for delivering spin angular momentum remotely to magnetic entities that otherwise could not be manipulated directly by current, for example, by coupling domain walls or other non-collinear spin textures in metallic and insulating media.</p>",[],False,"[""See-Hun Yang"", ""Chirag Garg"", ""Stuart S.

letter,Stress management in composite biopolymer networks,"<p>Living tissues show an extraordinary adaptiveness to strain, which is crucial for their proper biological functioning. The physical origin of this mechanical behaviour has been widely investigated using reconstituted networks of collagen fibres, the principal load-bearing component of tissues. However, collagen fibres in tissues are embedded in a soft hydrated polysaccharide matrix, which generates substantial internal stresses, and the effect of this on tissue mechanics is unknown. Here, by combining mechanical measurements and computer simulations, we show that networks composed of collagen fibres and a hyaluronan matrix exhibit synergistic mechanics characterized by an enhanced stiffness and delayed strain stiffening. We demonstrate that the polysaccharide matrix has a dual effect on the composite response involving both internal stress and elastic reinforcement. Our findings elucidate how tissues can tune their strain-sensitivity over a wide range and provide a novel design principle for synthetic materials with programmable mechanical properties.</p>",[],False,"[""Federica Burla"", ""Justin Tauber"", ""Simone Dussi"", ""Jasper van der Gucht"", ""Gijsje H.

letter,Enhanced bacterial swimming speeds in macromolecular polymer solutions,"<p>The locomotion of swimming bacteria in simple Newtonian fluids can successfully be described within the framework of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics. The presence of polymers in biofluids generally increases the viscosity, which is expected to lead to slower swimming for a constant bacterial motor torque. Surprisingly, however, experiments have shown that bacterial speeds can increase in polymeric fluids. Whereas, for example, artificial helical microswimmers in shear-thinning fluids or swimming Caenorhabditis elegans worms in wet granular media increase their speeds substantially, swimming Escherichia coli bacteria in polymeric fluids show just a small increase in speed at low polymer concentrations, followed by a decrease at higher concentrations. The mechanisms behind this behaviour are currently unclear, and therefore we perform extensive coarse-grained simulations of a bacterium swimming in explicitly modelled solutions of macromolecular polymers of different lengths and densities. We observe an increase of up to 60% in swimming speed with polymer density and demonstrate that this is due to a non-uniform distribution of polymers in the vicinity of the bacterium, leading to an apparent slip. However, this in itself cannot predict the large increase in swimming velocity: coupling to the chirality of the bacterial flagellum is also necessary.</p>",[],False,"[""Andreas Z\u00f6ttl"", ""Julia M.

In cold atom physics, this has been a focused research topic for nearly two decades, where strong interactions are naturally created and well manipulated by bringing the system close to a scattering resonance.

article,Second-order topology and multidimensional topological transitions in sonic crystals,"<p>Topological insulators with unique edge states have revolutionized the understanding of solid-state materials. Recently, higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), which host both gapped edge states and in-gap corner/hinge states, protected concurrently by band topology, were predicted and observed in experiments, unveiling a new horizon beyond the conventional bulk-edge correspondence. However, the control and manifestation of band topology in a hierarchy of dimensions, which is at the heart of HOTIs, have not yet been witnessed. Here, we propose theoretically and observe experimentally that tunable two-dimensional sonic crystals can be versatile systems to visualize and harness higher-order topology. In our systems, the two-dimensional acoustic bands mimic the quantum spin Hall effect, while the resultant one-dimensional helical edge states are gapped due to broken space-symmetry and carry quantized Zak phases, which then lead to zero-dimensional topological corner states. We demonstrate that topological transitions in the bulk and edges can be triggered independently by tuning the geometry of the sonic crystals. With complementary experiments and theories, our study reveals rich physics in HOTIs, opening a new route towards tunable topological metamaterials where novel applications, such as the topological transfer of acoustic energy among two-, one- and zero-dimensional modes, can be achieved.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiujuan Zhang"", ""Hai-Xiao Wang"", ""Zhi-Kang Lin"", ""Yuan Tian"", ""Biye Xie"", ""Ming-Hui Lu"", ""Yan-Feng Chen"", ""Jian-Hua Jiang""]","Zhang, X., Wang, HX., Lin, ZK. et al.

article,Stochastic nonlinear dynamics of confined cell migration in two-state systems,"<p>Migrating cells in physiological processes, including development, homeostasis and cancer, encounter structured environments and are forced to overcome physical obstacles. Yet, the dynamics of confined cell migration remains poorly understood, and thus there is a need to study the complex motility of cells in controlled confining microenvironments. Here, we develop two-state micropatterns, consisting of two adhesive sites connected by a thin constriction, in which migrating cells perform repeated stochastic transitions. This minimal system enables us to obtain a large ensemble of single-cell trajectories. From these trajectories, we infer an equation of cell motion, which decomposes the dynamics into deterministic and stochastic contributions in position&#8211;velocity phase space. Our results reveal that cells in two-state micropatterns exhibit intricate nonlinear migratory dynamics, with qualitatively similar features for a cancerous (MDA-MB-231) and a non-cancerous (MCF10A) cell line. In both cases, the cells drive themselves deterministically into the thin constriction; a process that is sped up by noise. Interestingly, however, these two cell lines have distinct deterministic dynamics: MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit a limit cycle, while MCF10A cells show excitable bistable dynamics. Our approach yields a conceptual framework that may be extended to understand cell migration in more complex confining environments.</p>",[],False,"[""David B.

article,Actin dynamics drive cell-like membrane deformation,"<p>Cell membrane deformations are crucial for proper cell function. Specialized protein assemblies initiate inward or outward membrane deformations that the cell uses respectively to uptake external substances or probe the environment. The assembly and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are involved in this process, although their detailed role remains controversial. We show here that a dynamic, branched actin network is sufficient to initiate both inward and outward membrane deformation. The polymerization of a dense actin network at the membrane of liposomes produces inward membrane bending at low tension, while outward deformations are robustly generated regardless of tension. Our results shed light on the mechanism cells use to internalize material, both in mammalian cells, where actin polymerization forces are required when membrane tension is increased, and in yeast, where those forces are necessary to overcome the opposing turgor pressure. By combining experimental observations with physical modelling, we propose a mechanism that explains how membrane tension and the architecture of the actin network regulate cell-like membrane deformations.</p>",[],False,"[""Camille Simon"", ""R\u00e9my Kusters"", ""Valentina Caorsi"", ""Antoine Allard"", ""Majdouline Abou-Ghali"", ""John Manzi"", ""Aur\u00e9lie Di Cicco"", ""Daniel L\u00e9vy"", ""Martin Lenz"", ""Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Joanny"", ""Cl\u00e9ment Campillo"", ""Julie Plastino"", ""Pierre Sens"", ""C\u00e9cile Sykes""]","Simon, C., Kusters, R., Caorsi, V. et al.

article,Bacteria display optimal transport near surfaces,"<p>The near-surface swimming patterns of bacteria are determined by hydrodynamic interactions between the bacteria and the surface, which trap the bacteria in smooth circular trajectories that lead to inefficient surface exploration. Here, we combine experiments with a data-driven mathematical model to show that the surface exploration of a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli results from a complex interplay between motility and transient surface adhesion events. These events allow the bacteria to break the smooth circular trajectories and regulate their transport properties by exploiting stop events that are facilitated by surface adhesion and lead to characteristic intermittent motion on surfaces. We find that the experimentally measured frequency of these stop-adhesion events coincides with the value that maximizes bacterial surface diffusivity according to our mathematical model. We discuss the applicability of our experimental and theoretical results to other bacterial strains on different surfaces. Our findings suggest that swimming bacteria use transient adhesion as a generic mechanism to regulate surface motion.</p>",[],False,"[""Emiliano Perez Ipi\u00f1a"", ""Stefan Otte"", ""Rodolphe Pontier-Bres"", ""Dorota Czerucka"", ""Fernando Peruani""]","Perez Ipiña, E., Otte, S., Pontier-Bres, R. et al.
