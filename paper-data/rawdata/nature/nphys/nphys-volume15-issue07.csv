letter,Polarization and entanglement in baryon–antibaryon pair production in electron–positron annihilation,"<p>Particles directly produced at electron&#8211;positron colliders, such as the J/&#968; meson, decay with relatively high probability into a baryon&#8211;antibaryon pair. For spin-1/2 baryons, the pair can have the same or opposite helicites. A non-vanishing phase &#916;&#934; between the transition amplitudes to these helicity states results in a transverse polarization of the baryons. From the joint angular distribution of the decay products of the baryons, this phase as well as the parameters characterizing the baryon and the antibaryon decays can be determined. Here, we report the measurement of &#916;&#934;&#8201;=&#8201;42.4&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.5&#176; using &#923;&#8201;&#8594;&#8201;p&#960;<sup>&#8722;</sup> and \(\bar \Lambda \to \bar p\pi ^ + ,\bar n\pi ^0\) decays at BESIII.

letter,Stable coherent terahertz synchrotron radiation from controlled relativistic electron bunches,"<p>Relativistic electron bunches used in synchrotron light sources are complex media, in which patterns might form spontaneously. These spatial structures were studied over the past decades for very practical reasons. The patterns, which spontaneously appear during an instability, increase the terahertz radiation power by factors exceeding 10,000. However, their irregularity largely prevented applications of this powerful source. Here we show that principles from chaos control theory allow us to generate regular spatio-temporal patterns, stabilizing the emitted terahertz power. Regular unstable solutions are expected to coexist with the undesired irregular solutions, and may thus be controllable using feedback control. We demonstrate the stabilization of such regular solutions in the Synchrotron SOLEIL storage ring. Operation of these controlled unstable solutions enables new designs of high-charge and stable synchrotron radiation sources.</p>",[],False,"[""C. Evain"", ""C. Szwaj"", ""E. Roussel"", ""J.

letter,Experimental characterization of two-particle entanglement through position and momentum correlations,"<p>Quantum simulation is a rapidly advancing tool for gaining insight into complex quantum states and their dynamics. Trapped-ion systems have pioneered deterministic state preparation and comprehensive state characterization, operating on localized and thus distinguishable particles. With ultracold atom experiments, one can prepare large samples of delocalized particles, but the same level of characterization has not yet been achieved. Here, we present a method to measure the positions and momenta of individual particles to obtain correlations and coherences. We demonstrate this with deterministically prepared samples of two interacting ultracold fermions in a coupled double well. As a first application, we use our technique to certify and quantify different types of entanglement.</p>",[],False,"[""Andrea Bergschneider"", ""Vincent M.

letter,Topological triply degenerate point with double Fermi arcs,"<p>Unconventional chiral particles have recently been predicted to appear in certain three-dimensional crystal structures containing three- or more-fold linear band degeneracy points (BDPs). These BDPs carry topological charges, but are distinct from the standard twofold Weyl points or fourfold Dirac points, and cannot be described in terms of an emergent relativistic field theory. Here we report on the experimental observation of a topological threefold BDP in a three-dimensional phononic crystal. Using direct acoustic field mapping, we demonstrate the existence of the threefold BDP in the bulk band structure, as well as doubled Fermi arcs of surface states consistent with a topological charge of 2. Another novel BDP, similar to a Dirac point but carrying non-zero topological charge, is connected to the threefold BDP via the doubled Fermi arcs. The Fermi arcs form double helicoids spanning a broad frequency range (relative bandwidth &gt;25%). We show that the non-contractibility of these arcs gives rise to the phenomenon of topologically protected negative refraction of surface states on all surfaces of the sample. Our work paves the way to using these unconventional particles for exploring new emergent physical phenomena, and may find applications in symmetry-stabilized three-dimensional zero-index metamaterials.</p>",[],False,"[""Yihao Yang"", ""Hong-xiang Sun"", ""Jian-ping Xia"", ""Haoran Xue"", ""Zhen Gao"", ""Yong Ge"", ""Ding Jia"", ""Shou-qi Yuan"", ""Yidong Chong"", ""Baile Zhang""]","Yang, Y., Sun, Hx., Xia, Jp. et al.

letter,Deep-subwavelength features of photonic skyrmions in a confined electromagnetic field with orbital angular momentum,"<p>In magnetic materials, skyrmions are nanoscale regions where the orientation of the electron spin changes in a vortex-type manner. Electromagnetic waves carry both spin and orbital angular momenta. Here we show that spin&#8211;orbit coupling in a focused vector beam results in a skyrmion-like structure of local photonic spin. While diffraction limits the spatial size of intensity variations, the direction of the electromagnetic field, which defines the polarization and local photonic spin state, is not subject to this limitation. We demonstrate that the local spin direction in the skyrmion-like structure varies on the deep-subwavelength scale down to 1/60 of the light wavelength, which corresponds to a length scale of about 10&#8201;nm. The application of photonic skyrmions may range from high-resolution imaging and precision metrology to quantum technologies and data storage where the local spin state of the field, not its intensity, can be applied to achieve deep-subwavelength optical patterns.</p>",[],False,"[""Luping Du"", ""Aiping Yang"", ""Anatoly V.

letter,Two-dimensional skyrmion bags in liquid crystals and ferromagnets,"<p>Reconfigurable, ordered matter offers great potential for future low-power computer memory by storing information in energetically stable configurations. Among these, skyrmions&#8212;which are topologically protected, robust excitations that have been demonstrated in chiral magnets and in liquid crystals&#8212;are driving much excitement about potential spintronic applications. These information-encoding structures topologically resemble field configurations in many other branches of physics and have a rich history, although chiral condensed-matter systems so far have yielded realizations only of elementary full and fractional skyrmions. Here we describe stable, high-degree multi-skyrmion configurations where an arbitrary number of antiskyrmions are contained within a larger skyrmion. We call these structures skyrmion bags. We demonstrate them experimentally and numerically in liquid crystals and numerically in micromagnetic simulations either without or with magnetostatic effects. We find that skyrmion bags act like single skyrmions in pairwise interaction and under the influence of current in magnetic materials, and are thus an exciting proposition for topological magnetic storage and logic devices.</p>",[],False,"[""David Foster"", ""Charles Kind"", ""Paul J.

letter,Large work extraction and the Landauer limit in a continuous Maxwell demon,"<p>The relation between entropy and information dates back to the classical Maxwell demon paradox, a thought experiment proposed in 1867 by James Clerk Maxwell to violate the second law of thermodynamics. A variant of the classical Maxwell demon is the Szilard engine, proposed by Leo Szilard in 1929. In it, at a given time, the demon observes the compartment occupied by a single molecule in a vessel and extracts work by operating a pulley device. Here, we introduce the continuous Maxwell demon, a device capable of extracting arbitrarily large amounts of work per cycle by repeated measurements of the state of a system, and experimentally test it in single DNA hairpin pulling experiments. In the continuous Maxwell demon, the demon monitors the state of the DNA hairpin (folded or unfolded) by observing it at equally spaced time intervals, but it extracts work only when the molecule changes state. We demonstrate that the average maximum work per cycle that can be extracted by the continuous Maxwell demon is limited by the information content of the stored sequences, in agreement with the second law. Work extraction efficiency is found to be maximal in the large information-content limit where work extraction is fuelled by rare events.</p>",[],False,"[""M. Ribezzi-Crivellari"", ""F.

article,Emergence of the geometric phase from quantum measurement back-action,"<p>The state vector representing a quantum system acquires a phase factor following an adiabatic evolution along a closed trajectory in phase space. This is the traditional example of a geometric phase, or Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry phase, a concept that has now been generalized beyond cyclic adiabatic evolutions to include generalized quantum measurements, and that has been experimentally measured in a variety of physical systems. However, a clear description of the relationship between the emergence of a geometric phase and the effects of a series of generalized quantum measurements on a quantum system has not yet been provided. Here we report that a sequence of weak measurements with continuously variable measurement strengths in a quantum optics experiment conclusively reveals that the quantum measurement back-action is the source of the geometric phase&#8212;that is, the stronger a quantum measurement, the larger the accumulated geometric phase. We furthermore find that in the limit of strong (projective) measurement there is a direct connection between the geometric phase and the sequential weak value, ordinarily associated with a series of weak quantum measurements.</p>",[],False,"[""Young-Wook Cho"", ""Yosep Kim"", ""Yeon-Ho Choi"", ""Yong-Su Kim"", ""Sang-Wook Han"", ""Sang-Yun Lee"", ""Sung Moon"", ""Yoon-Ho Kim""]","Cho, YW., Kim, Y., Choi, YH. et al.

article,Metamagnetic texture in a polar antiferromagnet,"<p>The notion of a simple ordered state implies homogeneity. If the order is established by a broken symmetry, the elementary Landau theory of phase transitions shows that only one symmetry mode describes this state. At the exact points of phase coexistence, domain states composed of large regions of different phases can be stabilized by long-range interactions. In uniaxial antiferromagnets, so-called metamagnetism is an example of such behaviour where antiferromagnetic and field-induced, spin-polarized paramagnetic/ferromagnetic states coexist at a jump-like transition in the magnetic phase diagram. Here, by combining experiments with theoretical analysis, we show that a different type of mixed state between antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism can be created in certain non-centrosymmetric materials. In small-angle neutron scattering experiments, we observe a field-driven spin state in the layered antiferromagnet Ca<sub>3</sub>Ru<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, which is modulated on a scale between 8 and 20&#8201;nm and has both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic parts. We call this state a metamagnetic texture and attribute its appearance to the chiral twisting effects of the asymmetric Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya exchange. The observation can be understood as an extraordinary coexistence&#8212;in one thermodynamic state&#8212;of spin orders that belong to different symmetries. The complex nature of this metamagnetic state is demonstrated experimentally by measurements of anomalies in electronic transport that reflect the spin polarization in the metamagnetic texture; determination of the magnetic orbital moments, which support the existence of strong spin&#8211;orbit effects, is a pre-requisite for the mechanism of twisted magnetic states in this material. Our findings provide an example of a rich and largely unexplored class of textured states. Such textures mediate between different ordering modes near phase coexistence, and produce extremely rich phase diagrams.</p>",[],False,"[""D. A. Sokolov"", ""N. Kikugawa"", ""T. Helm"", ""H.

article,Symmetry-enhanced discontinuous phase transition in a two-dimensional quantum magnet,"<p>In a quantum phase transition, the ground state and low-temperature properties of a system change drastically as some parameter controlling zero-point quantum fluctuations is tuned to a critical value. Like classical phase transitions driven by thermal fluctuations, a ground-state transition can be discontinuous (first order) or continuous. Theoretical studies have suggested exotic continuous transitions where a system develops higher symmetries than those of the underlying Hamiltonian. Here, we demonstrate an unconventional discontinuous transition between two ordered ground states of a quantum magnet, with an emergent symmetry of its coexistence state. We present a Monte Carlo study of a two-dimensional S&#8201;=&#8201;1/2 spin system hosting an antiferromagnetic state and a plaquette-singlet solid state of the kind recently detected in SrCu<sub>2</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. We show that the O(3) symmetric antiferromagnetic order and the scalar plaquette-singlet solid order form an O(4) vector at the transition. Unlike conventional first-order transitions, there are no energy barriers between the two coexisting phases, as the O(4) order parameter can be rotated at constant energy. Away from the transition, the O(4) surface is uniaxially deformed by the control parameter (a coupling ratio).

article,The microscopic role of deformation in the dynamics of soft colloids,"<p>Soft colloids enable the exploration of states with densities exceeding that of random close packing, but it remains unclear whether softness controls the dynamics under these dense conditions. Experimental studies have reported conflicting results, and numerical studies have so far focused primarily on simple models that allow particles to overlap, but neglect particle deformations. This makes the concept of softness in simulations and experiments difficult to compare. Here, we propose a model system consisting of polymer rings with internal elasticity. At high packing fractions, the system displays compressed exponential decay of the intermediate scattering functions and super-diffusive behaviour of the mean-squared displacements. These features are explained in terms of the complex interplay between particle deformations and dynamic heterogeneities, which gives rise to persistent motion of ballistic particles. We also observe a striking variation of the relaxation times with increasing particle softness, clearly demonstrating the crucial role of deformation in the dynamics of realistic soft colloids.</p>",[],False,"[""Nicoletta Gnan"", ""Emanuela Zaccarelli""]","Gnan, N., Zaccarelli, E.

article,Large and reversible myosin-dependent forces in rigidity sensing,"<p>Cells sense the rigidity of their environment through localized pinching, which occurs when myosin molecular motors generate contractions within actin filaments anchoring the cell to its surroundings. We present high-resolution experiments performed on these elementary contractile units in cells. Our experimental results challenge the current understanding of molecular motor force generation. Surprisingly, bipolar myosin filaments generate much larger forces per motor than measured in single-molecule experiments. Furthermore, contraction to a fixed distance, followed by relaxation at the same rate, is observed over a wide range of matrix rigidities. Finally, stepwise displacements of the matrix contacts are apparent during both contraction and relaxation. Building on a generic two-state model of molecular motor collections, we interpret these unexpected observations as spontaneously emerging features of a collective motor behaviour. Our approach explains why, in the cellular context, collections of resilient and slow motors contract in a stepwise fashion while collections of weak and fast motors do not. We thus rationalize the specificity of motor contractions implied in rigidity sensing compared to previous in vitro observations.</p>",[],False,"[""James Lohner"", ""Jean-Francois Rupprecht"", ""Junquiang Hu"", ""Nicola Mandriota"", ""Mayur Saxena"", ""Diego Pitta de Araujo"", ""James Hone"", ""Ozgur Sahin"", ""Jacques Prost"", ""Michael P.

article,Wound healing coordinates actin architectures to regulate mechanical work,"<p>How cells with diverse morphologies and cytoskeletal architectures modulate their mechanical behaviours to drive robust collective motion within tissues is poorly understood. During wound repair within epithelial monolayers in vitro, cells coordinate the assembly of branched and bundled actin networks to regulate the total mechanical work produced by collective cell motion. Using traction force microscopy, we show that the balance of actin network architectures optimizes the wound closure rate and the magnitude of the mechanical work. These values are constrained by the effective power exerted by the monolayer, which is conserved and independent of actin architectures. Using a cell-based physical model, we show that the rate at which mechanical work is done by the monolayer is limited by the transformation between actin network architectures and differential regulation of cell&#8211;substrate friction. These results and our proposed mechanisms provide a robust physical model for how cells collectively coordinate their non-equilibrium behaviours to dynamically regulate tissue-scale mechanical output.</p>",[],False,"[""Visar Ajeti"", ""A.

article,Oscillating droplet trains in microfluidic networks and their suppression in blood flow,"<p>Droplets forming sequences in simple microfluidic networks are known to exhibit complex behaviours, but their dynamics are yet to be probed in channels long enough to accommodate many droplets simultaneously. Here we show that uniform sequences of liquid droplets flowing through microfluidic networks can spontaneously form &#8216;trains&#8217; that periodically exchange between different branches of the network. Such system-wide oscillations do not rely on direct droplet&#8211;droplet interactions, are common to networks of various topologies, can be controlled or eliminated by adjusting network dimensions and can synchronize into larger flow patterns. The oscillations can also be suppressed via droplet collisions at diverging junctions. This mechanism may explain why red blood cells in microcapillaries exhibit only low-amplitude oscillations, preventing dangerous local hypertension or hypoxia that might otherwise ensue. Our findings are substantiated by a theoretical model that treats droplets as sets of moving points in one-dimensional ducts and captures the dynamics of large droplet ensembles without invoking the microscopic details of flows in or around the droplets. For blood flow, this simplified description offers more realistic estimates than continuous haemodynamic models, indicating the relevance of the discrete nature of blood to the excitation of oscillations.</p>",[],False,"[""O.

article,Conformational control of mechanical networks,"<p>Understanding conformational change is crucial for programming and controlling the function of many mechanobiological and mechanical systems such as robots, enzymes and tunable metamaterials. These systems are often modelled as constituent nodes (for example, joints or amino acids) whose motion is restricted by edges (for example, limbs or bonds) to yield functionally useful coordinated motions (for example, walking or allosteric regulation). However, the design of desired functions is made difficult by the complex dependence of these coordinated motions on the connectivity of edges. Here, we develop simple mathematical principles to design mechanical systems that achieve any desired infinitesimal or finite coordinated motion. We specifically study mechanical networks of two- and three-dimensional frames composed of nodes connected by freely rotating rods and springs. We first develop simple principles that govern all networks with an arbitrarily specified motion as the sole zero-energy mode. We then extend these principles to characterize networks that yield multiple specified zero modes, generate pre-stress stability and display branched motions. By coupling individual modules, we design networks with negative Poisson&#8217;s ratio and allosteric response. Finally, we extend our framework to networks with arbitrarily specifiable initial and final positions to design energy minima at desired geometric configurations, and create networks demonstrating tristability and cooperativity.</p>",[],False,"[""Jason Z.
