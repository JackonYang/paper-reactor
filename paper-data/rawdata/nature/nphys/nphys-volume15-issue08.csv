letter,Continuous force and displacement measurement below the standard quantum limit,"<p>Quantum mechanics dictates that the precision of physical measurements must always comply with certain noise constraints. In the case of interferometric displacement measurements, these restrictions impose a standard quantum limit (SQL), which optimally balances the precision of a measurement with its unwanted backaction. To go beyond this limit, one must devise more sophisticated measurement techniques, which either &#8216;evade&#8217; the backaction of the measurement or achieve clever cancellation of the unwanted noise at the detector. In the half-century since the SQL was established, systems ranging from LIGO to ultracold atoms and nanomechanical devices have pushed displacement measurements towards this limit, and a variety of sub-SQL techniques have been tested in proof-of-principle experiments. However, so far, no experimental system has successfully demonstrated an interferometric displacement measurement with sensitivity (including all relevant noise sources&#8212;thermal, backaction and imprecision) below the SQL. Here, we exploit strong quantum correlations in an ultracoherent optomechanical system to demonstrate off-resonant force and displacement sensitivity reaching 1.5&#8201;dB below the SQL. This achieves an outstanding goal in mechanical quantum sensing and further enhances the prospects of using such devices for state-of-the-art force sensing applications.</p>",[],False,"[""David Mason"", ""Junxin Chen"", ""Massimiliano Rossi"", ""Yeghishe Tsaturyan"", ""Albert Schliesser""]","Mason, D., Chen, J., Rossi, M. et al.

letter,Avoided quasiparticle decay from strong quantum interactions,"<p>Quantum states of matter&#8212;such as solids, magnets and topological phases&#8212;typically exhibit collective excitations (for example, phonons, magnons and anyons). These involve the motion of many particles in the system, yet, remarkably, act like a single emergent entity&#8212;a quasiparticle. Known to be long lived at the lowest energies, quasiparticles are expected to become unstable when encountering the inevitable continuum of many-particle excited states at high energies, where decay is kinematically allowed. Although this is correct for weak interactions, we show that strong interactions generically stabilize quasiparticles by pushing them out of the continuum. This general mechanism is straightforwardly illustrated in an exactly solvable model. Using state-of-the-art numerics, we find it at work in the spin-\(1/2\) triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet (TLHAF). This is surprising given the expectation of magnon decay in this paradigmatic frustrated magnet. Turning to existing experimental data, we identify the detailed phenomenology of avoided decay in the TLHAF material Ba<sub>3</sub>CoSb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, and even in liquid helium, one of the earliest instances of quasiparticle decay. Our work unifies various phenomena above the universal low-energy regime in a comprehensive description. This broadens our window of understanding of many-body excitations, and provides a new perspective for controlling and stabilizing quantum matter in the strongly interacting regime.</p>",[],False,"[""Ruben Verresen"", ""Roderich Moessner"", ""Frank Pollmann""]","Verresen, R., Moessner, R. & Pollmann, F.

letter,Kondo screening in a charge-insulating spinon metal,"<p>The Kondo effect, an eminent manifestation of many-body physics in condensed matter, is traditionally explained as exchange scattering of conduction electrons on a spinful impurity in a metal. The resulting screening of the impurity&#8217;s local moment by the electron Fermi sea is characterized by a Kondo temperature T<sub>K</sub>, below which the system enters a strongly coupled regime. In recent years, this effect has found realizations beyond the bulk-metal paradigm in many other conduction-electron systems, such as in quantum dots in semiconductor heterostructures and nanomaterials, in quantum point contacts, in graphene and in topological insulators, and has also been predicted for three-dimensional Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Here, we report an experimental observation of Kondo screening by charge-neutral quasiparticles. This occurs in a charge-insulating quantum spin liquid, where spinon excitations forming a Fermi surface take the role of conduction electrons. The observed impurity behaviour therefore bears a strong resemblance to the conventional case in a metal. The discovered spinon-based Kondo effect provides a prominent platform for characterizing spin liquids in the general context of utilizing impurities as in situ probes of host electron states, and offers a unique way to manipulate these enigmatic states.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

letter,Chiral topological semimetal with multifold band crossings and long Fermi arcs,"<p>Topological semimetals in crystals with a chiral structure (which possess a handedness due to a lack of mirror and inversion symmetries) are expected to display numerous exotic physical phenomena, including fermionic excitations with large topological charge, long Fermi arc surface states, unusual magnetotransport and lattice dynamics, as well as a quantized response to circularly polarized light. So far, all experimentally confirmed topological semimetals exist in crystals that contain mirror operations, meaning that these properties do not appear. Here, we show that AlPt is a structurally chiral topological semimetal that hosts new four-fold and six-fold fermions, which can be viewed as a higher spin generalization of Weyl fermions without equivalence in elementary particle physics. These multifold fermions are located at high symmetry points and have Chern numbers larger than those in Weyl semimetals, thus resulting in multiple Fermi arcs that span the full diagonal of the surface Brillouin zone. By imaging these long Fermi arcs, we experimentally determine the magnitude and sign of their Chern number, allowing us to relate their dispersion to the handedness of their host crystal.</p>",[],False,"[""Niels B.

letter,Universal optical control of chiral superconductors and Majorana modes,"<p>Chiral superconductors are a class of unconventional superconductors that host topologically protected chiral Majorana fermions at interfaces and domain walls, quasiparticles that could serve as a platform for topological quantum computing. Here we show that, in analogy to a qubit, the out-of-equilibrium superconducting state in such materials can be described by a Bloch vector and predict that they can be controlled on ultrafast timescales. The all-optical control mechanism is universal, permitting arbitrary rotations of the order parameter, and can induce a dynamical change of handedness of the condensate. It relies on transient breaking of crystal symmetries via choice of pulse polarization to enable arbitrary rotations of the Bloch vector. The mechanism extends to ultrafast timescales and the engineered state persists after the pump is switched off. We predict that these phenomena should appear in graphene or magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, as well as Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> (refs.&#8201;). Furthermore, we show that chiral superconductivity can be detected in time-resolved pump&#8211;probe measurements.

letter,"Intimate link between charge density wave, pseudogap and superconducting energy scales in cuprates","<p>The cuprate high-temperature superconductors develop spontaneous charge density wave (CDW) order below a temperature T<sub>CDW</sub> and over a wide range of hole doping (p). An outstanding challenge in the field is to understand whether this modulated phase is related to the more exhaustively studied pseudogap and superconducting phases. To address this issue, it is important to extract the energy scale &#916;<sub>CDW</sub> associated with the CDW order, and to compare it with the pseudogap &#916;<sub>PG</sub> and with the superconducting gap &#916;<sub>SC</sub>. However, while T<sub>CDW</sub> is well characterized from earlier work, little is currently known about &#916;<sub>CDW</sub>. Here, we report the extraction of &#916;<sub>CDW</sub> for several cuprates using electronic Raman spectroscopy. We find that on approaching the parent Mott state by lowering p, &#916;<sub>CDW</sub> increases in a manner similar to the doping dependence of &#916;<sub>PG</sub> and &#916;<sub>SC</sub>. This reveals that these three phases have a common microscopic origin. In addition, we find that &#916;<sub>CDW</sub>&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;&#916;<sub>SC</sub> over a substantial doping range, which suggests that CDW and superconducting phases are intimately related; for example, they may be intertwined or connected by an emergent symmetry.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

letter,Orientational and directional locking of colloidal clusters driven across periodic surfaces,"<p>When particles are driven across crystalline surfaces, their trajectories do not necessarily follow the applied force but become locked to the substrate lattice directions. Such directional locking, being relevant for bottom-up nanodevice assembly and particle sorting, has been intensively studied for isolated or single particles. Here we experimentally study the motion of extended colloidal clusters sliding over a periodically corrugated surface. We observe that both their orientational and centre-of-mass motions become locked into directions not coinciding with the substrate symmetry but determined by the geometrical moir&#233; superstructure formed by the cluster and substrate lattices. In general, such moir&#233; superstructures are not strictly periodic, which leads to competing locking directions depending on cluster size. Remarkably, we uncover a dependence of directional locking on the higher Fourier components of the surface corrugation profile, which can be tuned on atomic surfaces via the external load. This allows for an unprecedented control of cluster steering relevant for nanomanipulations on surfaces.</p>",[],False,"[""Xin Cao"", ""Emanuele Panizon"", ""Andrea Vanossi"", ""Nicola Manini"", ""Clemens Bechinger""]","Cao, X., Panizon, E., Vanossi, A. et al.

letter,Topological transition in stratified fluids,"<p>Lamb waves are trapped acoustic-gravity waves that propagate energy over great distances along a solid boundary in density-stratified, compressible fluids. They constitute useful indicators of explosions in planetary atmospheres. When the density stratification exceeds a threshold, or when the impermeability condition at the boundary is relaxed, atmospheric Lamb waves suddenly disappear. Here, we use topological arguments to predict the possible existence of new trapped Lamb-like waves in the absence of a solid boundary, depending on the stratification profile. The topological origin of the Lamb-like waves is emphasized by relating their existence to two-band crossing points carrying opposite Chern numbers. The existence of these band crossings coincides with a restoration of the vertical mirror symmetry that is in general broken by gravity. From this perspective, Lamb-like waves also bear strong similarities with boundary modes encountered in the quantum valley Hall effect and its classical analogues. Our study shows that the presence of Lamb-like waves encodes essential information on the underlying stratification profile in astrophysical and geophysical flows, which is often poorly constrained by observations.</p>",[],False,"[""Manolis Perrot"", ""Pierre Delplace"", ""Antoine Venaille""]","Perrot, M., Delplace, P. & Venaille, A.

letter,Quantum simulation of Unruh radiation,"<p>The exploration of quantum phenomena in a curved spacetime is an emerging interdisciplinary area at the interface between general relativity, thermodynamics and quantum information. One famous prediction in this field is Unruh thermal radiation&#8212;the manifestation of thermal radiation from a Minkowski vacuum when viewed in an accelerating reference frame. Here, we report the experimental observation of a matter field with thermal fluctuations that agree with Unruh&#8217;s predictions. The matter field is generated within a framework for the simulation of quantum physics in a non-inertial frame, based on Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates that are parametrically modulated to make their evolution replicate the frame transformation. We further observe long-range phase coherence and temporal reversal of the matter-wave radiation, hallmarks that distinguish Unruh radiation from its classical counterpart. Our demonstration offers a new avenue for the investigation of the dynamics of quantum many-body systems in a curved spacetime.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiazhong Hu"", ""Lei Feng"", ""Zhendong Zhang"", ""Cheng Chin""]","Hu, J., Feng, L., Zhang, Z. et al.

article,Identifying topological order through unsupervised machine learning,"<p>The Landau description of phase transitions relies on the identification of a local order parameter that indicates the onset of a symmetry-breaking phase. In contrast, topological phase transitions evade this paradigm and, as a result, are harder to identify. Recently, machine learning techniques have been shown to be capable of characterizing topological order in the presence of human supervision. Here, we propose an unsupervised approach based on diffusion maps that learns topological phase transitions from raw data without the need for manual feature engineering. Using bare spin configurations as input, the approach is shown to be capable of classifying samples of the two-dimensional XY model by winding number and capture the Berezinskii&#8211;Kosterlitz&#8211;Thouless transition. We also demonstrate the success of the approach on the Ising gauge theory, another paradigmatic model with topological order. In addition, a connection between the output of diffusion maps and the eigenstates of a quantum-well Hamiltonian is derived. Topological classification via diffusion maps can therefore enable fully unsupervised studies of exotic phases of matter.</p>",[],False,"[""Joaquin F. Rodriguez-Nieva"", ""Mathias S.

article,Chiral topological superconductivity arising from the interplay of geometric phase and electron correlation,"<p>In modern theory of solids, many-electron correlations can give rise to superconductivity, while the Berry or geometric phase is responsible for non-trivial topology. So far, these two physical ingredients have been taken into account only in a simple additive manner. Here, we carry out a systematic study of the interplay between geometric phase and electron correlation as well as their combined effects on topological and superconducting properties. Based on first-principles studies of Pb<sub>3</sub>Bi/Ge(111) as a prototypical system, we develop a generic two-dimensional effective formalism that respects hexagonal symmetry with Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling, displays a van Hove singularity and includes geometric phase-decorated electron correlations. Our functional renormalization group analysis shows that superconductivity dominates the competing orders in the weak interaction regime, with two consequences. First, the renormalized geometric phase flows to three stable fixed points, favouring chiral (p<sub>x</sub>&#8201;&#177;&#8201;ip<sub>y</sub>)-wave and f-wave superconducting states. Second, the corresponding superconductivity can be substantially enhanced. We construct the phase diagram of the topological quantum states, and identify hole-doped Pb<sub>3</sub>Bi/Ge(111) as an appealing platform for realizing chiral topological superconductivity in two-dimensional systems that are highly desirable for detecting and braiding Majorana fermions.</p>",[],False,"[""Wei Qin"", ""Leiqiang Li"", ""Zhenyu Zhang""]","Qin, W., Li, L. & Zhang, Z.

article,Resolution of gauge ambiguities in ultrastrong-coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics,"<p>In quantum electrodynamics, the choice of gauge influences the form of light&#8211;matter interactions. However, gauge invariance implies that all physical results should be independent of this formal choice. The Rabi model, a widespread description for the dipolar coupling between a two-level atom and a quantized electromagnetic field, seemingly violates this principle in the presence of ultrastrong light&#8211;matter coupling, a regime that is now experimentally accessible in many physical systems. This failure is attributed to the finite-level truncation of the matter system, an approximation that enters the derivation of the Rabi model. Here, we identify the source of gauge violation and provide a general method for the derivation of light&#8211;matter Hamiltonians in truncated Hilbert spaces that produces gauge-invariant physical results, even for extreme light&#8211;matter interaction regimes. This is achieved by compensating the non-localities introduced in the construction of the effective Hamiltonians. The resulting quantum Rabi Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge differs significantly in form from the standard one, but provides the same physical results obtained by using the dipole gauge. These results shed light on gauge invariance in the non-perturbative and extreme-interaction regimes, and solve long-lasting controversies arising from gauge ambiguities in the quantum Rabi and Dicke models.</p>",[],False,"[""Omar Di Stefano"", ""Alessio Settineri"", ""Vincenzo Macr\u00ec"", ""Luigi Garziano"", ""Roberto Stassi"", ""Salvatore Savasta"", ""Franco Nori""]","Di Stefano, O., Settineri, A., Macrì, V. et al.

article,Unified theory of thermal transport in crystals and glasses,"<p>Crystals and glasses exhibit fundamentally different heat conduction mechanisms: the periodicity of crystals allows for the excitation of propagating vibrational waves that carry heat, as first discussed by Peierls, while in glasses the lack of periodicity breaks Peierls&#8217;s picture and heat is mainly carried by the coupling of vibrational modes, often described by a harmonic theory introduced by Allen and Feldman. Anharmonicity or disorder are thus the limiting factors for thermal conductivity in crystals or glasses. Hitherto, no transport equation has been able to account for both. Here, we derive such an equation, resulting in a thermal conductivity that reduces to the Peierls and Allen&#8211;Feldman limits, respectively, in anharmonic crystals or harmonic glasses, while also covering the intermediate regimes where both effects are relevant. This approach also solves the long-standing problem of accurately predicting the thermal properties of crystals with ultralow or glass-like thermal conductivity, as we show with an application to a thermoelectric material representative of this class.</p>",[],False,"[""Michele Simoncelli"", ""Nicola Marzari"", ""Francesco Mauri""]","Simoncelli, M., Marzari, N. & Mauri, F.

Here, we present a systematic study of polaron spin lifetimes in field-effect transistors with high-mobility conjugated polymers as an active layer. We demonstrate how spin relaxation is governed by the charges&#8217; hopping motion at low temperatures, whereas an Elliott&#8211;Yafet-like relaxation due to a transient localization of the carrier wavefunctions is responsible for spin relaxation at high temperatures.

article,Scaling laws indicate distinct nucleation mechanisms of holes in the nuclear lamina,"<p>During a first-order phase transition, an interfacial layer is formed between the coexisting phases and kinetically limits homogeneous nucleation of the new phase in the original phase. This inhibition is commonly alleviated by the presence of impurities, often of unknown origin, that serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites for the transition. Living systems present a theoretical opportunity: the regulated structure of living systems allows modelling of the impurities, enabling quantitative analysis and comparison between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms, usually a difficult task. Here, we formulate an analytical model of heterogeneous nucleation of holes in the nuclear lamina, a phenomenon with implications in cancer metastasis, ageing and other diseases. We then present measurements of hole nucleation in the lamina of nuclei migrating through controlled constrictions and fit the experimental data to our heterogeneous nucleation model as well as a homogeneous model.

article,Lattice defects induce microtubule self-renewal,"<p>Microtubules are dynamic polymers, which grow and shrink by addition and removal of tubulin dimers at their extremities. Within the microtubule shaft, dimers adopt a densely packed and highly ordered crystal-like lattice structure, which is generally not considered to be dynamic. Here, we report that thermal forces are sufficient to remodel the microtubule shaft, despite its apparent stability. Our combined experimental data and numerical simulations on lattice dynamics and structure suggest that dimers can spontaneously leave and be incorporated into the lattice at structural defects. We propose a model mechanism, where the lattice dynamics is initiated via a passive breathing mechanism at dislocations, which are frequent in rapidly growing microtubules.

article,Stress relaxation in epithelial monolayers is controlled by the actomyosin cortex,"<p>Epithelial monolayers are one-cell-thick tissue sheets that line most of the body surfaces, separating internal and external environments. As part of their function, they must withstand extrinsic mechanical stresses applied at high strain rates. However, little is known about how monolayers respond to mechanical deformations. Here, by subjecting suspended epithelial monolayers to stretch, we find that they dissipate stresses on a minute timescale and that relaxation can be described by a power law with an exponential cut-off at timescales larger than about 10&#8201;s. This process involves an increase in monolayer length, pointing to active remodelling of cellular biopolymers at the molecular scale during relaxation. Strikingly, monolayers consisting of tens of thousands of cells relax stress with similar dynamics to single rounded cells, and both respond similarly to perturbations of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. By contrast, cell&#8211;cell junctional complexes and intermediate filaments do not relax tissue stress, but form stable connections between cells, allowing monolayers to behave rheologically as single cells. Taken together, our data show that actomyosin dynamics governs the rheological properties of epithelial monolayers, dissipating applied stresses and enabling changes in monolayer length.</p>",[],False,"[""Nargess Khalilgharibi"", ""Jonathan Fouchard"", ""Nina Asadipour"", ""Ricardo Barrientos"", ""Maria Duda"", ""Alessandra Bonfanti"", ""Amina Yonis"", ""Andrew Harris"", ""Payman Mosaffa"", ""Yasuyuki Fujita"", ""Alexandre Kabla"", ""Yanlan Mao"", ""Buzz Baum"", ""Jos\u00e9 J Mu\u00f1oz"", ""Mark Miodownik"", ""Guillaume Charras""]","Khalilgharibi, N., Fouchard, J., Asadipour, N. et al.

Combining experimental and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that nanoscale plasma membrane deformations nucleate a mechanochemical feedback loop that mediates longevity of the cell&#8217;s leading edge, a necessary requirement for directed cell migration. We further observe stochastic transitions between phases of random and persistent cell motion, whereby the mechanochemical circuit augments cell persistence and search area.

article,Substrate area confinement is a key determinant of cell velocity in collective migration,"<p>Collective cell migration is fundamental throughout development, during wound healing and in many diseases. Although much effort has focused on cell&#8211;cell junctions, a role for physical confinement in collective cell migration remains unclear. Here, we used adhesive microstripes of varying widths to mimic the spatial confinement experienced by follower cells within epithelial tissues. Our results reveal that the substrate area confinement is sufficient to modulate the three-dimensional cellular morphology without the need for intercellular adhesive cues. Our findings show a direct correlation between the migration velocity of confined cells and their cell&#8211;substrate adhesive area. Closer examination revealed that adhesive area confinement reduces lamellipodial protrusive forces, decreases the number of focal complexes at the leading edge and prevents the maturation of focal adhesions at the trailing edge, together leading to less effective forward propelling forces. The release of follower confinement required for the emergence of leader cells is associated with a threefold increase in contractile stress and a tenfold increase in protrusive forces, together providing a sufficient stress to generate highly motile mesenchymal cells.
