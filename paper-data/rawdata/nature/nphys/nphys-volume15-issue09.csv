letter,Interlayer fractional quantum Hall effect in a coupled graphene double layer,"<p>When a strong magnetic field is applied to a two-dimensional electron system, interactions between the electrons can cause fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effects. Bringing two two-dimensional conductors close to each other, a new set of correlated states can emerge due to interactions between electrons in the same and opposite layers. Here we report interlayer-correlated FQH states in a device consisting of two parallel graphene layers separated by a thin insulator. Current flow in one layer generates different quantized Hall signals in the two layers. This result is interpreted using composite fermion (CF) theory with different intralayer and interlayer Chern&#8211;Simons gauge-field couplings. We observe FQH states corresponding to integer values of CF Landau level (LL) filling in both layers, as well as &#8216;semiquantized&#8217; states, where a full CF LL couples to a continuously varying partially filled CF LL. We also find a quantized state between two coupled half-filled CF LLs and attribute it to an interlayer CF exciton condensate.</p>",[],False,"[""Xiaomeng Liu"", ""Zeyu Hao"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Bertrand I.

letter,Pairing states of composite fermions in double-layer graphene,"<p>Heterostructures of vertically stacked graphene double layers, separated by a thin tunnel barrier, provide a highly tunable system to explore strongly interacting electron states. This is because the interlayer Coulomb interactions can be sensitively tuned simply by varying the barrier thickness. Recent studies of double-layer graphene have shown that, in the quantum Hall effect regime, strong interlayer coupling can induce electron&#8211;hole pairing across the two layers, resulting in a superfluid phase of interlayer excitons. Here, we report a series of emergent fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states appearing under similar conditions. We find excellent agreement between the sequence of observable FQHE states and the theoretically proposed two-component composite-fermion (CF) model, where the CF quasiparticle construction results from both interlayer and intralayer interactions. Most remarkably, we observe an additional series of incompressible states at fractional filling that do not fit within either the single- or two-component CF models. We interpret these states to result from residual pairing interactions between CFs, representing a new type of correlated ground state that is unique to graphene double-layer structures and not described by the conventional CF model.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

letter,Disorder-induced multifractal superconductivity in monolayer niobium dichalcogenides,"<p>The interplay between disorder and superconductivity is a subtle and fascinating phenomenon in quantum many-body physics. Conventional superconductors are insensitive to dilute non-magnetic impurities, known as Anderson&#8217;s theorem. Destruction of superconductivity and even superconductor&#8211;insulator transitions occur in the regime of strong disorder. Hence, disorder-enhanced superconductivity is rare and has been observed only in some alloys or granular states. Owing to the entanglement of various effects, the mechanism of enhancement is still under debate. Here, we report a well-controlled disorder effect in the recently discovered monolayer NbSe<sub>2</sub> superconductor. The superconducting transition temperatures of NbSe<sub>2</sub> monolayers are substantially increased by disorder. Realistic theoretical modelling shows that the unusual enhancement possibly arises from the multifractality of electron wavefunctions.

letter,Observation of nodal-line semimetal with ultracold fermions in an optical lattice,"<p>The observation of topological phases beyond two dimensions, as widely reported in solid-state systems, has been an open challenge for ultracold atoms. Although many theoretical schemes have been proposed, the experimental complexity in realizing and characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) band structure has acted as a barrier against experiments achieving this. Here, we realize a 3D spin&#8211;orbit coupled nodal-line semimetal in an optical Raman lattice filled with ultracold fermions, and observe the bulk line nodes in the band structure. The realized topological semimetal exhibits an emergent magnetic group symmetry. This allows detection of the nodal lines by effectively reconstructing the 3D topological band from a series of measurements of integrated spin textures, which precisely render spin textures on the parameter-tuned magnetic-group-symmetric planes. The detection technique can be applied generally to explore 3D topological states of similar symmetries. Furthermore, we observe the band inversion lines from topological quench dynamics, which are bulk counterparts of Fermi arc states and connect the Dirac points, reconfirming the realized topological band. Our results demonstrate an approach to effectively observe 3D band topology, and open the way to probe exotic topological physics for ultracold atoms in high dimensions.</p>",[],False,"[""Bo Song"", ""Chengdong He"", ""Sen Niu"", ""Long Zhang"", ""Zejian Ren"", ""Xiong-Jun Liu"", ""Gyu-Boong Jo""]","Song, B., He, C., Niu, S. et al.

letter,Classifying snapshots of the doped Hubbard model with machine learning,"<p>Quantum gas microscopes for ultracold atoms can provide high-resolution real-space snapshots of complex many-body systems. We implement machine learning to analyse and classify such snapshots of ultracold atoms. Specifically, we compare the data from an experimental realization of the two-dimensional Fermi&#8211;Hubbard model to two theoretical approaches: a doped quantum spin liquid state of resonating valence bond type, and the geometric string theory, describing a state with hidden spin order. This technique considers all available information without a potential bias towards one particular theory by the choice of an observable and can therefore select the theory that is more predictive in general. Up to intermediate doping values, our algorithm tends to classify experimental snapshots as geometric-string-like, as compared to the doped spin liquid.

Switching between different optical pumping regimes, we implement the scattershot, Gaussian and standard boson sampling protocols in the same silicon chip, which integrates linear and nonlinear photonic circuitry.

letter,Quantum electrodynamics of a superconductor–insulator phase transition,"<p>A chain of Josephson junctions represents one of the simplest many-body models undergoing a superconductor&#8211;insulator quantum phase transition. Apart from zero resistance, the superconducting state is necessarily accompanied by a sound-like mode due to collective oscillations of the phase of the complex-valued order parameter. Little is known about the fate of this mode on entering the insulating state, where the order parameter&#8217;s amplitude remains non-zero, but the phase ordering is &#8216;melted&#8217; by quantum fluctuations. Here, we show that the phase mode survives far into the insulating regime, such that megaohm-resistance chains can carry gigahertz-frequency alternating currents as nearly ideal superconductors. The insulator reveals itself through interaction-induced broadening and random frequency shifts of collective mode resonances. Our spectroscopic experiment puts forward the problem of quantum electrodynamics of a Bose glass for both theory and experiment. By pushing the chain parameters deeper into the insulating state, we achieved a wave impedance of the phase mode exceeding the predicted critical value by an order of magnitude. The effective fine structure constant of such a one-dimensional electromagnetic vacuum exceeds unity, promising transformative applications to quantum science and technology.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

article,Experimental few-copy multipartite entanglement detection,"<p>Many future quantum technologies rely on the generation of entangled states. Quantum devices will require verification of their operation below some error threshold, but the reliable detection of quantum entanglement remains a considerable challenge for large-scale quantum systems. Well-established techniques for this task rely on the measurement of expectation values of entanglement witnesses; however these require many measurement settings to be extracted. Here, we develop a generic framework for efficient entanglement detection that translates any entanglement witness into a resource-efficient probabilistic scheme, whose confidence grows exponentially with the number of individual detection events, namely copies of the quantum state. To benchmark our findings, we experimentally verify the presence of entanglement in a photonic six-qubit cluster state generated using three single-photon sources operating at telecommunication wavelengths. We find that the presence of entanglement can be certified with at least 99.74% confidence by detecting 20 copies of the quantum state. Additionally, we show that genuine six-qubit entanglement is verified with at least 99% confidence by using 112 copies of the state. Our protocol can be carried out with a remarkably low number of copies and in the presence of experimental imperfections, making it a practical and applicable method to verify large-scale quantum devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Valeria Saggio"", ""Aleksandra Dimi\u0107"", ""Chiara Greganti"", ""Lee A.

article,Coherently driving a single quantum two-level system with dichromatic laser pulses,"<p>The excitation of individual two-level quantum systems using an electromagnetic field is an elementary tool of quantum optics, with widespread applications across quantum technologies. The efficient excitation of a single two-level system usually requires the driving field to be at the same frequency as the transition between the two quantum levels. However, in solid-state implementations, the scattered laser light can dominate over the single photons emitted by the two-level system, imposing a challenge for single-photon sources. Here, we propose a background-free method for the coherent excitation and control of a two-level quantum system using a phase-locked dichromatic electromagnetic field with no spectral overlap with the optical transition. We demonstrate this method experimentally by stimulating single-photon emission from a single quantum dot embedded in a micropillar, reaching single-photon purity of 0.988(1) and indistinguishability of 0.962(6). The phase-coherent nature of our two-colour excitation scheme is demonstrated by the dependence of the resonance fluorescence intensity on the relative phase between the two pulses. Our two-colour excitation method represents an additional and useful tool for the study of atom&#8211;photon interaction, and the generation of spectrally isolated indistinguishable single photons.</p>",[],False,"[""Yu-Ming He"", ""Hui Wang"", ""Can Wang"", ""M.-C.

article,Fragility of the dissipationless state in clean two-dimensional superconductors,"<p>Dissipationless charge transport is one of the defining properties of superconductors, but the interplay between dimensionality and disorder in determining the onset of dissipation remains an open theoretical and experimental problem. Here, we present measurements of the dissipation phase diagrams of superconductors in the two-dimensional limit, layer by layer, down to a monolayer in the presence of temperature (T), magnetic field (B) and current (I) in 2H-NbSe<sub>2</sub>. Our results show that the phase diagram strongly depends on the thickness even in the two-dimensional limit. At four layers we can define a finite region in the I&#8211;B phase diagram where dissipationless transport exists at T&#8201;=&#8201;0. At even smaller thicknesses, this region shrinks in area until in a monolayer it approaches a single point defined by T&#8201;=&#8201;B&#8201;=&#8201;I&#8201;=&#8201;0. In applied field, we show that time-dependent Ginzburg&#8211;Landau simulations that describe dissipation by vortex motion qualitatively reproduce our experimental I&#8211;B phase diagram. Last, we show that by using non-local transport and time-dependent Ginzburg&#8211;Landau calculations that we can engineer charge flow and create phase boundaries between dissipative and dissipationless transport regions in a single sample, demonstrating control over non-equilibrium states of matter.</p>",[],False,"[""A.

article,Unconventional thermal metallic state of charge-neutral fermions in an insulator,"<p>Quantum oscillations in transport and thermodynamic parameters at high magnetic fields are an unambiguous signature of the Fermi surface, the defining characteristic of a metal. Recent observations of quantum oscillations in insulating SmB<sub>6</sub> and YbB<sub>12</sub>, therefore, have been a big surprise&#8212;despite the large charge gap inferred from the insulating behaviour of the resistivity, these compounds seemingly host a Fermi surface at high magnetic fields. However, the nature of the ground state in zero field has been little explored. Here, we report the use of low-temperature heat-transport measurements to discover gapless, itinerant, charge-neutral excitations in the ground state of YbB<sub>12</sub>. At zero field, sizeable linear temperature-dependent terms in the heat capacity and thermal conductivity are clearly resolved in the zero-temperature limit, indicating the presence of gapless fermionic excitations with an itinerant character. Remarkably, linear temperature-dependent thermal conductivity leads to a spectacular violation of the Wiedemann&#8211;Franz law: the Lorenz ratio is 10<sup>4</sup>&#8211;10<sup>5</sup> times larger than that expected in conventional metals, indicating that YbB<sub>12</sub> is a charge insulator and a thermal metal. Moreover, we find that these fermions couple to magnetic fields, despite their charge neutrality. Our findings expose novel quasiparticles in this unconventional quantum state.</p>",[],False,"[""Y.

article,Subcycle squeezing of light from a time flow perspective,"<p>Light as a carrier of information and energy plays a fundamental role in both general relativity and quantum physics, linking these areas that are still not fully compliant with each other. Usually the quantum nature of light is described in the frequency domain. Even for broadband quantum states with a well-defined carrier frequency, a quasi-continuous-wave picture is still applicable. However, recent access to subcycle quantum features of electromagnetic radiation promises a new class of time-dependent quantum states of light. Paralleled with the developments in attosecond science, these advances motivate an urgent need for a theoretical framework that treats arbitrary wavepackets of quantum light intrinsically in the time domain. Here, we formulate a consistent time-domain theory of the generation and sampling of few-cycle and subcycle pulsed squeezed states, leading to a relativistic interpretation in terms of induced changes in the local flow of time. Our theory enables the use of such states as a resource for novel ultrafast applications in quantum optics and quantum information.</p>",[],False,"[""Matthias Kizmann"", ""Thiago Lucena de M.

article,The mechanical stability of proteins regulates their translocation rate into the cell nucleus,"<p>A cell&#8217;s ability to react to mechanical stimuli is known to be affected by the transport of transcription factors, the proteins responsible for regulating transcription of DNA into RNA, across the membrane enveloping its nucleus. Yet the molecular mechanisms by which mechanical cues control this process remain unclear. Here we show that one such protein, myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA), is imported into the nucleus at a rate that is inversely correlated with its nanomechanical stability, but independent of its thermodynamic stability. Attaching mechanically stable proteins to MRTFA results in reduced gene expression and the subsequent slowing down of cell migration. We conclude that the mechanical unfolding of proteins regulates their nuclear translocation rate, and highlight the role of the nuclear pore complex as a selective mechanosensor that is capable of detecting forces as low as &#8764;10&#8201;pN. The modulation of the mechanical stability of transcription factors may represent a general strategy for the control of gene expression.</p>",[],False,"[""Elvira Infante"", ""Andrew Stannard"", ""Stephanie J.
