review article,The physics of cell-size regulation across timescales,"<p>The size of a cell is determined by a combination of synthesis, self-assembly, incoming matter and the balance of mechanical forces. Such processes operate at the single-cell level, but they are deeply interconnected with cell-cycle progression, resulting in a stable average cell size at the population level. Here, we examine this phenomenon by reviewing the physics of growth processes that operate at vastly different timescales, but result in the controlled production of daughter cells that are close copies of their mothers. We first review the regulatory mechanisms of size at short timescales, focusing on the contribution of fundamental physical forces. We then discuss the multiple relevant regulation processes operating on the timescale of the cell cycle. Finally, we look at how these processes interact: one of the most important challenges to date involves bridging the gap between timescales, connecting the physics of cell growth and the biology of cell-cycle progression.</p>",[],False,"[""Clotilde Cadart"", ""Larisa Venkova"", ""Pierre Recho"", ""Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino"", ""Matthieu Piel""]","Cadart, C., Venkova, L., Recho, P. et al.

letter,Magnetic resonance imaging of single atoms on a surface,"<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revolutionized diagnostic medicine and biomedical research by allowing non-invasive access to spin ensembles. To enhance MRI resolution to the nanometre scale, new approaches including scanning probe methods have been used in recent years, which culminated in the detection of individual spins. This allowed for the visualization of organic samples and magnetic structures, as well as identifying the location of electron and nuclear spins. Here, we demonstrate the MRI of individual atoms on a surface. The set-up, implemented in a cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscope, uses single-atom electron spin resonance to achieve sub&#229;ngstr&#246;m resolution, exceeding the spatial resolution of previous MRI experiments by one to two orders of magnitude. We find that MRI scans of different atomic species and with different probe tips lead to unique signatures in the resonance images. These signatures reveal the magnetic interactions between the tip and the atom, in particular magnetic dipolar and exchange interaction.</p>",[],False,"[""Philip Willke"", ""Kai Yang"", ""Yujeong Bae"", ""Andreas J.

letter,Large linear-in-temperature resistivity in twisted bilayer graphene,"<p>Twisted bilayer graphene has recently emerged as a platform for hosting correlated phenomena. For twist angles near &#952;&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;1.1&#176;, the low-energy electronic structure of twisted bilayer graphene features isolated bands with a flat dispersion. Recent experiments have observed a variety of low-temperature phases that appear to be driven by electron interactions, including insulating states, superconductivity and magnetism. Here we report electrical transport measurements up to room temperature for twist angles varying between 0.75&#176; and 2&#176;. We find that the resistivity, &#961;, scales linearly with temperature, T, over a wide range of T before falling again owing to interband activation. The T-linear response is much larger than observed in monolayer graphene for all measured devices, and in particular increases by more than three orders of magnitude in the range where the flat band exists. Our results point to the dominant role of electron&#8211;phonon scattering in twisted bilayer graphene, with possible implications for the origin of the observed superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Hryhoriy Polshyn"", ""Matthew Yankowitz"", ""Shaowen Chen"", ""Yuxuan Zhang"", ""K.

letter,Self-induced Berry flux and spontaneous non-equilibrium magnetism,"<p>When a physical system is governed by statistical or dynamical equations possessing certain symmetries, its stationary states can be classified into phases according to which of those symmetries are preserved, and which are broken. Near equilibrium, the properties of the system&#8217;s collective excitations reflect the symmetries of the underlying phase and thereby provide means for detecting these phases. Here, we show that, in driven systems, the collective modes may take on a separate life, exhibiting their own spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomena independent of the underlying equilibrium phase. We illustrate this principle by demonstrating a mechanism through which a non-magnetic interacting metal subjected to a linearly polarized driving field can spontaneously magnetize. The strong internal a.c. fields of the metal driven close to its plasmonic resonance enable Berryogenesis: the spontaneous generation of a self-induced Bloch band Berry flux. The self-induced Berry flux supports and is sustained by a chiral circulating plasmonic motion that breaks the mirror symmetry of the system. This non-equilibrium phase transition may be of either continuous or discontinuous type. Berryogenesis can occur in a wide variety of multiband metals with high-quality plasmons, as available in present-day graphene devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Mark S. Rudner"", ""Justin C. W.

letter,High-harmonic generation from an epsilon-near-zero material,"<p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a signature optical phenomenon of strongly driven, nonlinear optical systems. Specifically, the understanding of the HHG process in rare gases has played a key role in the development of attosecond science. Recently, HHG has also been reported in solids, providing novel opportunities such as controlling strong-field and attosecond processes in dense optical media down to the nanoscale. Here, we report HHG from a low-loss, indium-doped cadmium oxide thin film by leveraging the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effect, whereby the real part of the material&#8217;s permittivity in certain spectral ranges vanishes, as well as the associated large resonant enhancement of the driving laser field. We find that ENZ-assisted harmonics exhibit a pronounced spectral redshift as well as linewidth broadening, resulting from the photo induced electron heating and the consequent time-dependent ENZ wavelength of the material. Our results provide a new platform to study strong-field and ultrafast electron dynamics in ENZ materials, reveal new degrees of freedom for spectral and temporal control of HHG, and open up the possibilities of compact solid-state attosecond light sources.</p>",[],False,"[""Yuanmu Yang"", ""Jian Lu"", ""Alejandro Manjavacas"", ""Ting S.

letter,Self-propelling droplets on fibres subject to a crosswind,"<p>In many situations in which droplets wet fibres, wind is present. Large nets are used to harvest fog transported by coastal breezes from the ocean and noxious aerosols are contained in chemical plants by driving them across fibrous filters. In glass wool factories, thin fibres are subjected to airflows as they are simultaneously sprayed with resin to glue them together. The control and reconfiguration of the liquid in these situations is essential. It can be set geometrically, as is the case for assemblies of non-parallel fibres or tapered cylinders, but the wind itself may also be exploited for this purpose. Here, we show that a transverse wind can induce directional motion of droplets along horizontal fibres&#8212;even upwind if the fibre is tilted&#8212;and generate strong repulsive interactions between droplets.

article,Topological chaos in active nematics,"<p>Active nematics are out-of-equilibrium fluids composed of rod-like subunits, which can generate large-scale, self-driven flows. We examine a microtubule-kinesin-based active nematic confined to two dimensions, exhibiting chaotic flows with moving topological defects. Applying tools from chaos theory, we investigate self-driven advection and mixing on different length scales. Local fluid stretching is quantified by the Lyapunov exponent. Global mixing is quantified by the topological entropy, calculated from both defect braiding and curve extension rates. We find excellent agreement between these independent measures of chaos, demonstrating that the extensile stretching between microtubules directly translates into macroscopic braiding of positive defects. Remarkably, increasing extensile activity (through ATP concentration) does not increase the dimensionless topological entropy. This study represents an application of chaotic advection to the emerging field of active nematics and quantification of the collective motion of an ensemble of defects (through topological entropy) in a liquid crystal.</p>",[],False,"[""Amanda J.

article,Probing dense baryon-rich matter with virtual photons,"<p>About 10&#8201;&#956;s after the Big Bang, the universe was filled&#8212;in addition to photons and leptons&#8212;with strong-interaction matter consisting of quarks and gluons, which transitioned to hadrons at temperatures close to kT&#8201;=&#8201;150&#8201;MeV and densities several times higher than those found in nuclei. This quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter can be created in the laboratory as a transient state by colliding heavy ions at relativistic energies. The different phases in which QCD matter may exist depend for example on temperature, pressure or baryochemical potential, and can be probed by studying the emission of electromagnetic radiation. Electron&#8211;positron pairs emerge from the decay of virtual photons, which immediately decouple from the strong interaction, and thus provide information about the properties of QCD matter at various stages. Here, we report the observation of virtual photon emission from baryon-rich QCD matter. The spectral distribution of the electron&#8211;positron pairs is nearly exponential, providing evidence for a source of temperature in excess of 70&#8201;MeV with constituents whose properties have been modified, thus reflecting peculiarities of strong-interaction QCD matter. Its bulk properties are similar to the dense matter formed in the final state of a neutron star merger, as apparent from recent multimessenger observation.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Experimental signatures of a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid in effective spin-1/2 Ce2Zr2O7 pyrochlore,"<p>A quantum spin liquid is a state of matter where unpaired electrons&#8217; spins, although entangled, do not show magnetic order even at the zero temperature. The realization of a quantum spin liquid is a long-sought goal in condensed-matter physics. Although neutron scattering experiments on the two-dimensional spin-1/2 kagome lattice ZnCu<sub>3</sub>(OD)<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and triangular lattice YbMgGaO<sub>4</sub> have found evidence for the hallmark of a quantum spin liquid at very low temperature (a continuum of magnetic excitations), the presence of magnetic and non-magnetic site chemical disorder complicates the interpretation of the data. Recently, the three-dimensional Ce<sup>3+</sup> pyrochlore lattice Ce<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> has been suggested as a clean, effective spin-1/2 quantum spin liquid candidate, but evidence of a spin excitation continuum is still missing. Here, we use thermodynamic, muon spin relaxation and neutron scattering experiments on single crystals of Ce<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, a compound isostructural to Ce<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, to demonstrate the absence of magnetic ordering and the presence of a spin excitation continuum at 35&#8201;mK. With no evidence of oxygen deficiency and magnetic/non-magnetic ion disorder seen by neutron diffraction and diffuse scattering measurements, Ce<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> may be a three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice quantum spin liquid material with minimum magnetic and non-magnetic chemical disorder.</p>",[],False,"[""Bin Gao"", ""Tong Chen"", ""David W.

article,Field-tunable quantum disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NaYbO2,"<p>Antiferromagnetically coupled S&#8201;=&#8201;1/2 spins on an isotropic triangular lattice are the paradigm of frustrated quantum magnetism, but structurally ideal realizations are rare. Here, we investigate NaYbO<sub>2</sub>, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective J<sub>eff</sub>&#8201;=&#8201;1/2 moments with no inherent site disorder. No signatures of conventional magnetic order appear down to 50&#8201;mK, strongly suggesting a quantum spin liquid ground state. We observe a two-peak specific heat and a nearly quadratic temperature dependence, in agreement with expectations for a two-dimensional Dirac spin liquid. Application of a magnetic field strongly perturbs the quantum disordered ground state and induces a clear transition into a collinear ordered state, consistent with a long-predicted up&#8211;up&#8211;down structure for a triangular-lattice XXZ Hamiltonian driven by quantum fluctuations. The observation of spin liquid signatures in zero field and quantum-induced ordering in intermediate fields in the same compound demonstrates an intrinsically quantum disordered ground state. We conclude that NaYbO<sub>2</sub> is a model, versatile platform for exploring spin liquid physics with full tunability of field and temperature.</p>",[],False,"[""Mitchell M.

article,Multiple superionic states in helium–water compounds,"<p>Superionic states are phases of matter that can simultaneously exhibit some of the properties of a liquid and of a solid. For example, in superionic ice, hydrogen atoms can move freely while oxygen atoms are fixed in their sublattice. &#8216;Superionicity&#8217; has attracted much attention in both fundamental science and applications. Helium is the most inert element in nature and it is generally considered to be unreactive. Here, we use ab initio calculations to show that He and H<sub>2</sub>O can form stable compounds within a large pressure range that can exist even close to ambient pressure. Surprisingly, we find that they can form two previously unknown types of superionic state under high pressure and high temperature. In the first of these phases, the helium atoms exhibit liquid behaviour within a fixed ice-lattice framework. In the second phase, both helium and hydrogen atoms move in a liquid-like fashion within a fixed oxygen sublattice. As the He&#8211;O interaction is weaker than the H&#8211;O interaction, the helium atoms in these superionic states have larger diffusion coefficients and lower &#8216;melting&#8217; temperatures than those of hydrogen, although helium is heavier than hydrogen. The insertion of helium atoms substantially decreases the pressure at which superionic states may be formed, compared to those in pure ice.</p>",[],False,"[""Cong Liu"", ""Hao Gao"", ""Yong Wang"", ""Richard J.

article,Dynamics of soliton crystals in optical microresonators,"<p>Dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators combine nonlinear optical physics with photonic-integrated technologies. They are promising for a number of applications ranging from optical coherent communications to astrophysical spectrometer calibration, and are also of fundamental interest to the physical sciences. Dissipative Kerr solitons can form a variety of stable states, including breathers and multiple-soliton formations. Among these states, soliton crystals stand out: temporally ordered ensembles of soliton pulses, which are regularly arranged by a modulation of the continuous-wave intracavity driving field. To date, however, the dynamics of soliton crystals and their defect-free generation remain unexplored. Here, we show that the chaotic operating regimes of driven optical microresonators significantly impact the dynamics of soliton crystals. We realize deterministic generation of perfect soliton crystal states, which correspond to a stable, defect-free lattice of intracavity optical pulses. We reveal a critical pump power, below which the stochastic process of soliton excitation abruptly becomes deterministic, which enables faultless, device-independent access to perfect soliton crystals. We also demonstrate the switching of these states and its relation to the regime of transient chaos. Finally, we report on other dynamical phenomena observed in soliton crystals including the formation of breathers, transitions between perfect soliton crystals, their melting and recrystallization.</p>",[],False,"[""Maxim Karpov"", ""Martin H.

article,A cell-size threshold limits cell polarity and asymmetric division potential,"<p>Reaction&#8211;diffusion networks underlie pattern formation in a range of biological contexts, from morphogenesis of organisms to the polarization of individual cells. One requirement for such molecular networks is that output patterns be scaled to system size. At the same time, kinetic properties of constituent molecules constrain the ability of networks to adapt to size changes. Here, we explore these constraints and the consequences thereof within the conserved PAR cell polarity network. Using the stem-cell-like germ lineage of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo as a model, we find that the behaviour of PAR proteins fails to scale with cell size. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this lack of scaling results in a size threshold below which polarity is destabilized, yielding an unpolarized system. In empirically constrained models, this threshold occurs near the size at which germ lineage cells normally switch between asymmetric and symmetric modes of division. Consistent with cell size limiting polarity and division asymmetry, genetic or physical reduction in germ lineage cell size is sufficient to trigger loss of polarity in normally polarizing cells at predicted size thresholds. Physical limits of polarity networks may be one mechanism by which cells read out geometrical features to inform cell fate decisions.</p>",[],False,"[""Lars Hubatsch"", ""Florent Peglion"", ""Jacob D.

article,Low-dimensional dynamics of two coupled biological oscillators,"<p>The circadian clock and the cell cycle are two biological oscillatory processes that coexist within individual cells. These two oscillators were found to interact, which can lead to their synchronization. Here, we develop a method to identify a low-dimensional stochastic model of the coupled system directly from time-lapse imaging in single cells. In particular, we infer the coupling and nonlinear dynamics of the two oscillators from thousands of mouse and human single-cell fluorescence microscopy traces. This coupling predicts multiple phase-locked states showing different degrees of robustness against molecular fluctuations inherent to cellular-scale biological oscillators. For the 1:1 state, the predicted phase-shifts following period perturbations were validated experimentally. Moreover, the phase-locked states are temperature-independent and evolutionarily conserved from mouse to human, hinting at a common underlying dynamical mechanism. Finally, we detect a signature of the coupled dynamics in a physiological context, explaining why tissues with different proliferation states exhibited shifted circadian clock phases.</p>",[],False,"[""Colas Droin"", ""Eric R.

article,A laboratory model for the Parker spiral and magnetized stellar winds,"<p>Many rotating stars have magnetic fields that interact with the winds they produce. The Sun is no exception. The interaction between the Sun&#8217;s magnetic field and the solar wind gives rise to the heliospheric magnetic field&#8212;a spiralling magnetic structure, known as the Parker spiral, which pervades the Solar System. This magnetic field is critical for governing plasma processes that source the solar wind. Here, we report the creation of a laboratory model of the Parker spiral system based on a rapidly rotating plasma magnetosphere and the measurement of its global structure and dynamic behaviour. This laboratory system exhibits regions where the plasma flows evolve in a similar manner to many magnetized stellar winds. We observe the advection of the magnetic field into an Archimedean spiral and the ejection of quasi-periodic plasma blobs into the stellar outflow, which mimics the observed plasmoids that fuel the slow solar wind. This process involves magnetic reconnection and can be modelled numerically by the inclusion of two-fluid effects in the simulation. The Parker spiral system mimicked in the laboratory can be used for studying solar wind dynamics in a complementary fashion to conventional space missions such as NASA&#8217;s Parker Solar Probe mission.</p>",[],False,"[""Ethan E.
