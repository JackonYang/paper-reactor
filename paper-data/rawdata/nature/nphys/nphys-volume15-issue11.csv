letter,Bayesian estimation of the specific shear and bulk viscosity of quark–gluon plasma,"<p>Ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy atomic nuclei produce an extremely hot and dense phase of matter, known as quark&#8211;gluon plasma (QGP), which behaves like a near-perfect fluid with the smallest specific shear viscosity&#8212;the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density&#8212;of any known substance. Due to its transience (lifetime&#8201;~&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;23</sup>&#8201;s) and microscopic size (10<sup>&#8722;14</sup>&#8201;m), the QGP cannot be observed directly, but only through the particles it emits; however, its characteristics can be inferred by matching the output of computational collision models to experimental observations. Previous work, using viscous relativistic hydrodynamics to simulate QGP, has achieved semiquantitative constraints on key physical properties, such as its specific shear and bulk viscosity, but with large, poorly defined uncertainties. Here, we present the most precise estimates so far of QGP properties, including their quantitative uncertainties. By applying established Bayesian parameter estimation methods to a dynamical collision model and a wide variety of experimental data, we extract estimates of the temperature-dependent specific shear and bulk viscosity simultaneously with related initial-condition properties. The method is extensible to other collision models and experimental data and may be used to characterize additional aspects of high-energy nuclear collisions.</p>",[],False,"[""Jonah E.

letter,Molecular lattice clock with long vibrational coherence,"<p>Atomic lattice clocks have spurred numerous ideas for tests of fundamental physics, detection of general relativistic effects and studies of interacting many-body systems. On the other hand, molecular structure and dynamics offer rich energy scales that are at the heart of new protocols in precision measurement and quantum information science. Here, we demonstrate a fundamentally distinct type of lattice clock that is based on vibrations in diatomic molecules, and present coherent Rabi oscillations between weakly and deeply bound molecules that persist for tens of milliseconds. This control is made possible by a state-insensitive magic lattice trap that weakly couples to molecular vibronic resonances and enhances the coherence time of light-induced clock state superpositions by several orders of magnitude.

letter,Non-exponential decay of a giant artificial atom,"<p>In quantum optics, light&#8211;matter interaction has conventionally been studied using small atoms interacting with electromagnetic fields with wavelength several orders of magnitude larger than the atomic dimensions. In contrast, here we experimentally demonstrate the vastly different &#8216;giant atom&#8217; regime, where an artificial atom interacts with acoustic fields with wavelength several orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic dimensions. This is achieved by coupling a superconducting qubit to surface acoustic waves at two points with separation on the order of 100 wavelengths. This approach is comparable to controlling the radiation of an atom by attaching it to an antenna. The slow velocity of sound leads to a significant internal time-delay for the field to propagate across the giant atom, giving rise to non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate the non-Markovian character of the giant atom in the frequency spectrum as well as non-exponential relaxation in the time domain.</p>",[],False,"[""Gustav Andersson"", ""Baladitya Suri"", ""Lingzhen Guo"", ""Thomas Aref"", ""Per Delsing""]","Andersson, G., Suri, B., Guo, L. et al.

letter,Vanishing carrier-envelope-phase-sensitive response in optical-field photoemission from plasmonic nanoantennas,"<p>At the surfaces of nanostructures, enhanced electric fields can drive optical-field photoemission and thereby generate and control electrical currents at frequencies exceeding 100&#8201;THz (refs. ). A hallmark of such optical-field photoemission is the sensitivity of the total emitted current to the carrier-envelope phase (CEP). Here, we examine CEP-sensitive photoemission from plasmonic gold nanoantennas excited with few-cycle optical pulses. At a critical pulse energy, which we call a vanishing point, we observe a pronounced dip in the magnitude of the CEP-sensitive photocurrent accompanied by a sudden shift of &#960; radians in the photocurrent phase. Analysis shows that this vanishing behaviour arises due to competition between sub-optical-cycle electron emission events from neighbouring optical half-cycles and that both the dip and phase shift are highly sensitive to the precise shape of the driving optical waveform at the surface of the emitter. As the mechanisms underlying the dip and phase shift are a general consequence of nonlinear, field-driven photoemission, they may be used to probe sub-optical-cycle emission processes from solid-state emitters, atoms and molecules. Improved understanding of these CEP-sensitive photocurrent features will be critical to the development of optical-field-driven photocathodes for time-domain metrology and microscopy applications demanding attosecond temporal and nanometre spatial resolution.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

letter,Giant gate-controlled proximity magnetoresistance in semiconductor-based ferromagnetic–non-magnetic bilayers,"<p>The evolution of information technology has been driven by the discovery of new forms of large magnetoresistance, such as giant magnetoresistance and tunnelling magnetoresistance, in magnetic multilayers. Recently, new types of this effect have been observed in much simpler bilayers consisting of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic thin films. However, the magnitude of the change in resistance with magnetic field in these materials is very small, varying between 0.01 and 1%. Here, we demonstrate that non-magnetic&#8211;ferromagnetic bilayers consisting of a conducting non-magnetic InAs quantum well and an insulating ferromagnetic (Ga,Fe)Sb layer exhibit giant proximity magnetoresistance of approximately 80% at high magnetic field, and that its magnitude can be controlled by a gate. The mechanism for this large magnetoresistance is a strong magnetic proximity effect. The spin splitting in the InAs quantum well induced by the magnetic proximity effect can be varied between 0.17&#8201;meV and 3.8&#8201;meV by varying the gate voltage. In principle, this provides a mechanism to locally access Majorana fermions in InAs-based Josephson junctions and introduces a new concept of magnetic-gating spin transistors in which the non-magnetic channel current is modulated by both electrical and magnetic means.</p>",[],False,"[""Kosuke Takiguchi"", ""Le Duc Anh"", ""Takahiro Chiba"", ""Tomohiro Koyama"", ""Daichi Chiba"", ""Masaaki Tanaka""]","Takiguchi, K., Anh, L.D., Chiba, T. et al.

letter,"Identification of spin, valley and moiré quasi-angular momentum of interlayer excitons","<p>Moir&#233; superlattices provide a powerful way to engineer the properties of electrons and excitons in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures. The moir&#233; effect can be especially strong for interlayer excitons, where electrons and holes reside in different layers and can be addressed separately. In particular, it was recently proposed that the moir&#233; superlattice potential not only localizes interlayer exciton states at different superlattice positions, but also hosts an emerging moir&#233; quasi-angular momentum (QAM) that periodically switches the optical selection rules for interlayer excitons at different moir&#233; sites.

We demonstrate that interlayer excitons localized at different moir&#233; sites can exhibit opposite optical selection rules due to the spatially varying moir&#233; QAM.

letter,Attosecond screening dynamics mediated by electron localization in transition metals,"<p>Transition metals, with their densely confined and strongly coupled valence electrons, are key constituents of many materials with unconventional properties, such as high-temperature superconductors, Mott insulators and transition metal dichalcogenides. Strong interaction offers a fast and efficient lever to manipulate electron properties with light, creating promising potential for next-generation electronics. However, the underlying dynamics is a hard-to-understand, fast and intricate interplay of polarization and screening effects, which are hidden below the femtosecond timescale of electronic thermalization that follows photoexcitation. Here, we investigate the many-body electron dynamics in transition metals before thermalization sets in. We combine the sensitivity of intra-shell transitions to screening effects with attosecond time resolution to uncover the interplay of photo-absorption and screening. First-principles time-dependent calculations allow us to assign our experimental observations to ultrafast electronic localization on d orbitals. The latter modifies the electronic structure as well as the collective dynamic response of the system on a timescale much faster than the light-field cycle. Our results demonstrate a possibility for steering the electronic properties of solids before electron thermalization. We anticipate that our study may facilitate further investigations of electronic phase transitions, laser&#8211;metal interactions and photo-absorption in correlated-electron systems on their natural timescales.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

Here, we report the experimental observation of photonic Weyl degeneracies in a magnetized semiconductor&#8212;InSb, which behaves as a magnetized plasma for electromagnetic waves at the terahertz band. By varying the magnetic field strength, Weyl points and the corresponding photonic Fermi arcs have been demonstrated.

letter,Generation and acceleration of electron bunches from a plasma photocathode,"<p>Plasma waves generated in the wake of intense, relativistic laser or particle beams can accelerate electron bunches to gigaelectronvolt energies in centimetre-scale distances. This allows the realization of compact accelerators with emerging applications ranging from modern light sources such as the free-electron laser to energy frontier lepton colliders. In a plasma wakefield accelerator, such multi-gigavolt-per-metre wakefields can accelerate witness electron bunches that are either externally injected or captured from the background plasma. Here we demonstrate optically triggered injection and acceleration of electron bunches, generated in a multi-component hydrogen and helium plasma employing a spatially aligned and synchronized laser pulse. This &#8216;plasma photocathode&#8217; decouples injection from wake excitation by liberating tunnel-ionized helium electrons directly inside the plasma cavity, where these cold electrons are then rapidly boosted to relativistic velocities. The injection regime can be accessed via optical density down-ramp injection and is an important step towards the generation of electron beams with unprecedented low transverse emittance, high current and 6D-brightness. This experimental path opens numerous prospects for transformative plasma wakefield accelerator applications based on ultrahigh-brightness beams.</p>",[],False,"[""A. Deng"", ""O. S. Karger"", ""T.

article,Realization of density-dependent Peierls phases to engineer quantized gauge fields coupled to ultracold matter,"<p>Gauge fields that appear in models of high-energy and condensed-matter physics are dynamical quantum degrees of freedom due to their coupling to matter fields. Since the dynamics of these strongly correlated systems is hard to compute, it was proposed to implement this basic coupling mechanism in quantum simulation platforms with the ultimate goal to emulate lattice gauge theories. Here, we realize the fundamental ingredient for a density-dependent gauge field acting on ultracold fermions in an optical lattice by engineering non-trivial Peierls phases that depend on the site occupations. We propose and implement a Floquet scheme that relies on breaking time-reversal symmetry by driving the lattice simultaneously at two frequencies that are resonant with the on-site interactions. This induces density-assisted tunnelling processes that are controllable in amplitude and phase.

The tunnel coupling features two distinct regimes as a function of the modulation amplitudes, which can be characterized by a \({\Bbb Z}_2\)-invariant.

article,Floquet approach to ℤ2 lattice gauge theories with ultracold atoms in optical lattices,"<p>Quantum simulation has the potential to investigate gauge theories in strongly interacting regimes, which are currently inaccessible through conventional numerical techniques. Here, we take a first step in this direction by implementing a Floquet-based method for studying \({\Bbb Z}_2\) lattice gauge theories using two-component ultracold atoms in a double-well potential. For resonant periodic driving at the on-site interaction strength and an appropriate choice of the modulation parameters, the effective Floquet Hamiltonian exhibits \({\Bbb Z}_2\) symmetry. We study the dynamics of the system for different initial states and critically contrast the observed evolution with a theoretical analysis of the full time-dependent Hamiltonian of the periodically driven lattice model. We reveal challenges that arise due to symmetry-breaking terms and outline potential pathways to overcome these limitations. Our results provide important insights for future studies of lattice gauge theories based on Floquet techniques.</p>",[],False,"[""Christian Schweizer"", ""Fabian Grusdt"", ""Moritz Berngruber"", ""Luca Barbiero"", ""Eugene Demler"", ""Nathan Goldman"", ""Immanuel Bloch"", ""Monika Aidelsburger""]","Schweizer, C., Grusdt, F., Berngruber, M. et al.

article,Electronic correlations in twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle,"<p>Twisted bilayer graphene with a twist angle of around 1.1&#176; features a pair of isolated flat electronic bands and forms a platform for investigating strongly correlated electrons. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to probe the local properties of highly tunable twisted bilayer graphene devices and show that the flat bands deform when aligned with the Fermi level. When the bands are half-filled, we observe the development of gaps originating from correlated insulating states. Near charge neutrality, we find a previously unidentified correlated regime featuring an enhanced splitting of the flat bands. We describe this within a microscopic model that predicts a strong tendency towards nematic ordering. Our results provide insights into symmetry-breaking correlation effects and highlight the importance of electronic interactions for all filling fractions in twisted bilayer graphene.</p>",[],False,"[""Youngjoon Choi"", ""Jeannette Kemmer"", ""Yang Peng"", ""Alex Thomson"", ""Harpreet Arora"", ""Robert Polski"", ""Yiran Zhang"", ""Hechen Ren"", ""Jason Alicea"", ""Gil Refael"", ""Felix von Oppen"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Stevan Nadj-Perge""]","Choi, Y., Kemmer, J., Peng, Y. et al.

article,Half-integer level shift of vortex bound states in an iron-based superconductor,"<p>Vortices in topological superconductors may host Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which have been proposed as the building blocks of fault-tolerant topological quantum computers. Recently, a new single-material platform with the potential for realizing MZMs has been discovered in iron-based superconductors, without involving hybrid semiconductor&#8211;superconductor structures. Here, we report a detailed scanning tunnelling spectroscopy study of a FeTe<sub>0.55</sub>Se<sub>0.45</sub> single crystal and show that this material hosts two distinct classes of vortex. These differ by a half-integer level shift in the energy spectra of the vortex bound states. This level shift is directly tied to the presence or absence of a zero-bias conductance peak and also alters the ratios of higher energy levels from integer to half-odd-integer. Our model calculations fully reproduce the spectra of these two types of vortex bound state, suggesting the presence of regions with and without topological surface states, which coexist within the same crystal. Our findings provide strong evidence for the presence of MZMs in FeTe<sub>0.55</sub>Se<sub>0.45</sub> and establish it as an excellent platform for further studies.</p>",[],False,"[""Lingyuan Kong"", ""Shiyu Zhu"", ""Micha\u0142 Papaj"", ""Hui Chen"", ""Lu Cao"", ""Hiroki Isobe"", ""Yuqing Xing"", ""Wenyao Liu"", ""Dongfei Wang"", ""Peng Fan"", ""Yujie Sun"", ""Shixuan Du"", ""John Schneeloch"", ""Ruidan Zhong"", ""Genda Gu"", ""Liang Fu"", ""Hong-Jun Gao"", ""Hong Ding""]","Kong, L., Zhu, S., Papaj, M. et al.

article,The odd free surface flows of a colloidal chiral fluid,"<p>In simple fluids, such as water, invariance under parity and time-reversal symmetry imposes that the rotation of constituent &#8216;atoms&#8217; is determined by the flow and that viscous stresses damp motion. Activation of the rotational degrees of freedom of a fluid by spinning its atomic building blocks breaks these constraints and has thus been the subject of fundamental theoretical interest across classical and quantum fluids. However, the creation of a model liquid that isolates chiral hydrodynamic phenomena has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the creation of a cohesive two-dimensional chiral liquid consisting of millions of spinning colloidal magnets and study its flows. We find that dissipative viscous &#8216;edge-pumping&#8217; is a key and general mechanism of chiral hydrodynamics, driving unidirectional surface waves and instabilities, with no counterpart in conventional fluids. Spectral measurements of the chiral surface dynamics suggest the presence of Hall viscosity, an experimentally elusive property of chiral fluids. Precise measurements and comparison with theory demonstrate excellent agreement with a minimal chiral hydrodynamic model, paving the way for the exploration of chiral hydrodynamics in experiment.</p>",[],False,"[""Vishal Soni"", ""Ephraim S.

article,Tissue fluidity promotes epithelial wound healing,"<p>The collective behaviour of cells in epithelial tissues is dependent on their mechanical properties. However, the contribution of tissue mechanics to wound healing in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the relationship between tissue mechanics and wound healing in live Drosophila wing imaginal discs and show that by tuning epithelial cell junctional tension, we can systematically alter the rate of wound healing. Coincident with the contraction of an actomyosin purse string, we observe cells flowing past each other at the wound edge by intercalating, reminiscent of molecules in a fluid, resulting in seamless wound closure. Using a cell-based physical model, we predict that a reduction in junctional tension fluidizes the tissue through an increase in intercalation rate and corresponding reduction in bulk viscosity, in the manner of an unjamming transition. The resultant fluidization of the tissue accelerates wound healing. Accordingly, when we experimentally reduce tissue tension in wing discs, the intercalation rate increases and wounds repair in less time.</p>",[],False,"[""Robert J. Tetley"", ""Michael F.
