letter,Magnetic fields alter strong-field ionization,"<p>When a strong laser pulse induces the ionization of an atom, momentum conservation dictates that the absorbed photons transfer their momentum to the electron and its parent ion. The sharing of the photon momentum between the two particles and its underlying mechanism in strong-field ionization, occurring when the bound electron tunnels through the barrier created by the superposition of the atomic potential and the electric laser field, are still debated in theory after 30 years of research. Corresponding experiments are very challenging due to the extremely small photon momentum and their precision has been too limited, so far, to ultimately resolve this debate. By utilizing an experimental approach relying on two counter-propagating laser pulses, we present a detailed study of the effects of the photon momentum in strong-field ionization. The high precision of the method and the intrinsically known zero momentum allow us to unambiguously demonstrate the action of the light&#8217;s magnetic field on the electron while it is under the tunnel barrier, which has only been theoretically predicted so far, thereby disproving opposing predictions. Our results deepen the understanding of, for example, molecular imaging and time-resolved photoelectron holography.</p>",[],False,"[""A. Hartung"", ""S. Eckart"", ""S. Brennecke"", ""J. Rist"", ""D.

letter,Kibble–Zurek universality in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid,"<p>The Kibble&#8211;Zurek mechanism describes the spontaneous formation of topological defects in a system crossing a continuous phase transition. Its central premise is the notion of universality, which states that the characteristic scaling exponent describing the dependence of the defect density on the quench rate is determined by the underlying symmetries of the system. Whether this universality can be extended to strongly interacting systems, such as a unitary Fermi gas, is an open question that has recently drawn attention in the context of holographic theories. Here, we report the observation of the Kibble&#8211;Zurek universality in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid. As the microscopic nature of superfluidity is tuned from Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation of tightly bound molecules to Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superfluidity of long-range fermion pairs, the thermal quench formation of vortices reveals a constant scaling exponent arising from the U(1) gauge symmetry of the system. In rapid quenches, destructive vortex collisions lead to the saturation of vortex densities, the values of which can be universally scaled by the interaction-dependent area of the vortex cores. This work paves the way for precision studies of non-equilibrium dynamics in a highly tunable, strongly correlated many-fermion system.</p>",[],False,"[""Bumsuk Ko"", ""Jee Woo Park"", ""Y.

letter,Quantum state tomography across the exceptional point in a single dissipative qubit,"<p>Open physical systems can be described by effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that characterize the gain or loss of energy or particle numbers from the system. Experimental realization of optical and mechanical non-Hermitian systems has been reported, demonstrating functionalities such as lasing, topological features, optimal energy transfer and enhanced sensing. Such realizations have been limited to classical (wave) systems in which only the amplitude information, not the phase, is measured. Thus, the effects of a systems&#8217;s proximity to an exceptional point&#8212;a degeneracy of such non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenmodes coalesce&#8212;on its quantum evolution remain unexplored. Here, we use post-selection on a three-level superconducting transmon circuit to carry out quantum state tomography of a single dissipative qubit in the vicinity of its exceptional point. We observe the spacetime reflection symmetry-breaking transition at zero detuning, decoherence enhancement at finite detuning and a quantum signature of the exceptional point in the qubit relaxation state. Our experiments show phenomena associated with non-Hermitian physics such as non-orthogonality of eigenstates in a fully quantum regime, which could provide a route to the exploration and harnessing of exceptional point degeneracies for quantum information processing.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

letter,Vibrational spectroscopy at atomic resolution with electron impact scattering,"<p>Atomic vibrations control all thermally activated processes in materials, including diffusion, heat transport, phase transformations and surface chemistry. Recent developments in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) have enabled nanoscale probing of vibrational modes using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Although atomically resolved analysis is routine in STEM, vibrational spectroscopy employing oscillating dipoles yields signals originating from regions tens of nanometres in size, because the scattering angles are only a few microradians. Recently, it has been shown that energy-filtered images recorded at high scattering angles display atomic resolution. Here we show, using conventional on-axis EELS, that non-dipole, impact scattering vibrational signals are present, and exhibit atomic resolution. This on-axis signal shows variations in the spectral peak shape and intensity as the electron probe is scanned across an individual atomic column in a Si sample. Although atomic spatial resolution in coherent elastic scattering will complicate the quantitative interpretation of spectra from crystals, the change in peak shape provides compelling evidence that the vibrational EELS excitation process is highly localized. High spatial resolution is also demonstrated in SiO<sub>2</sub>, an amorphous polar material. Our approach represents an important technical advance that will provide new insights into the local thermal, elastic and kinetic properties of materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Kartik Venkatraman"", ""Barnaby D.

letter,Quantum superposition of molecules beyond 25 kDa,"<p>Matter-wave interference experiments provide a direct confirmation of the quantum superposition principle, a hallmark of quantum theory, and thereby constrain possible modifications to quantum mechanics. By increasing the mass of the interfering particles and the macroscopicity of the superposition, more stringent bounds can be placed on modified quantum theories such as objective collapse models. Here, we report interference of a molecular library of functionalized oligoporphyrins with masses beyond 25,000&#8201;Da and consisting of up to 2,000 atoms, by far the heaviest objects shown to exhibit matter-wave interference to date. We demonstrate quantum superposition of these massive particles by measuring interference fringes in a new 2-m-long Talbot&#8211;Lau interferometer that permits access to a wide range of particle masses with a large variety of internal states. The molecules in our study have de Broglie wavelengths down to 53&#8201;fm, five orders of magnitude smaller than the diameter of the molecules themselves. Our results show excellent agreement with quantum theory and cannot be explained classically. The interference fringes reach more than 90% of the expected visibility and the resulting macroscopicity value of 14.1 represents an order of magnitude increase over previous experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Yaakov Y.

letter,Semimetallic molecular hydrogen at pressure above 350 GPa,"<p>According to theoretical predictions, insulating molecular hydrogen dissociates and transforms into an atomic metal at pressures P&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;370&#8211;500&#8201;GPa (refs.&#8201;). In another scenario, the metallization first occurs in the 250&#8211;500&#8201;GPa pressure range in molecular hydrogen through overlapping of electronic bands. The calculations are not accurate enough to predict which option is realized. Here, we show that at a pressure of 350&#8211;360&#8201;GPa and temperatures &lt;200&#8201;K, the hydrogen starts to conduct, and that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity is typical of a semimetal. The conductivity, measured up to 440&#8201;GPa, increases strongly with pressure. Raman spectra, measured up to 480&#8201;GPa, indicate that hydrogen remains a molecular solid at pressures up to 440&#8201;GPa, while at higher pressures the Raman signal vanishes, probably indicating further transformation to a good molecular metal or to an atomic state.</p>",[],False,"[""M.

We observe superconductivity in the highest magnetic field range identified for any re-entrant superconductor, beyond 65&#8201;T.

letter,Enhancement of interlayer exchange in an ultrathin two-dimensional magnet,"<p>Following the recent isolation of monolayer CrI<sub>3</sub> (ref. ), many more two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials have been isolated. Their incorporation in van der Waals heterostructures offers a new platform for spintronics, proximity magnetism and quantum spin liquids. A primary question in this field is how exfoliating crystals to the few-layer limit influences their magnetism. Studies of CrI<sub>3</sub> have shown a different magnetic ground state for ultrathin exfoliated films compared with the bulk, but the origin is not yet understood. Here, we use electron tunnelling through few-layer crystals of the layered antiferromagnetic insulator CrCl<sub>3</sub> to probe its magnetic order and find a tenfold enhancement of the interlayer exchange compared with bulk crystals. Moreover, temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals that the crystallographic phase transition of bulk crystals does not occur in exfoliated films. This results in a different low-temperature stacking order and, we hypothesize, increased interlayer exchange. Our study provides insight into the connection between stacking order and interlayer interactions in two-dimensional magnets, which may be relevant for correlating stacking faults and mechanical deformations with the magnetic ground states of other more exotic layered magnets such as RuCl<sub>3</sub> (ref. ).</p>",[],False,"[""Dahlia R.

letter,Atomic-scale fragmentation and collapse of antiferromagnetic order in a doped Mott insulator,"<p>Disentangling the relationship between the insulating state with a charge gap and the magnetic order in an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator remains difficult due to inherent phase separation as the Mott state is perturbed. Measuring magnetic and electronic properties at atomic length scales would provide crucial insight, but this is yet to be experimentally achieved. Here, we use spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy (SP-STM) to visualize the periodic spin-resolved modulations originating from the antiferromagnetic order in a relativistic Mott insulator Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> (refs. ), and how they change as a function of doping. We find that near the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT), the long-range antiferromagnetic order melts into a fragmented state with short-range correlations. Crucially, we discover that the short-range antiferromagnetic order is locally uncorrelated with the observed spectral gap magnitude. This suggests that static short-range antiferromagnetic correlations are unlikely to be the cause of the inhomogeneous closing of the spectral gap and the emergence of pseudogap regions near the IMT. Our work establishes SP-STM as a powerful tool for revealing atomic-scale magnetic information in complex oxides.</p>",[],False,"[""He Zhao"", ""Sujit Manna"", ""Zach Porter"", ""Xiang Chen"", ""Andrew Uzdejczyk"", ""Jagadeesh Moodera"", ""Ziqiang Wang"", ""Stephen D.

However, its direct application to problems in quantum physics is challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body systems. Motivated by recent advances in realizing quantum information processors, we introduce and analyse a quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks, a highly effective model in machine learning. Our quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) uses only O(log(N)) variational parameters for input sizes of N qubits, allowing for its efficient training and implementation on realistic, near-term quantum devices. To explicitly illustrate its capabilities, we show that QCNNs can accurately recognize quantum states associated with a one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phase, with performance surpassing existing approaches.

article,Femtosecond-resolved observation of the fragmentation of buckminsterfullerene following X-ray multiphoton ionization,"<p>X-ray free-electron lasers have, over the past decade, opened up the possibility of understanding the ultrafast response of matter to intense X-ray pulses. In earlier research on atoms and small molecules, new aspects of this response were uncovered, such as rapid sequences of inner-shell photoionization and Auger ionization. Here, we studied a larger molecule, buckminsterfullerene (C<sub>60</sub>), exposed to 640&#8201;eV X-rays, and examined the role of chemical effects, such as chemical bonds and charge transfer, on the fragmentation following multiple ionization of the molecule. To provide time resolution, we performed femtosecond-resolved X-ray pump/X-ray probe measurements, which were accompanied by advanced simulations. The simulations and experiment reveal that despite substantial ionization induced by the ultrashort (20&#8201;fs) X-ray pump pulse, the fragmentation of C<sub>60</sub> is considerably delayed. This work uncovers the persistence of the molecular structure of C<sub>60</sub>, which hinders fragmentation over a timescale of hundreds of femtoseconds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a substantial fraction of the ejected fragments are neutral carbon atoms. These findings provide insights into X-ray free-electron laser-induced radiation damage in large molecules, including biomolecules.</p>",[],False,"[""N. Berrah"", ""A. Sanchez-Gonzalez"", ""Z.

article,Light emission based on nanophotonic vacuum forces,"<p>The vanishingly small response of matter to light above ultraviolet frequencies makes the manipulation of light emission at such frequencies challenging. As a result, state-of-the-art sources of high-frequency light are typically active, relying on strong external electromagnetic fields. Here, we present a fundamental mechanism of light emission that is fully passive, relying instead on vacuum fluctuations near nanophotonic structures. This mechanism can be used to generate light at any frequency, including high-frequency radiation such as X-rays. The proposed mechanism is equivalent to a quantum optical two-photon process, in which a free electron spontaneously emits a low-energy polariton and a high-energy photon simultaneously. Although two-photon processes are nominally weak, we find that the resulting X-ray radiation can be substantial. The strength of this process is related to the strong Casimir&#8211;Polder forces that atoms experience in the nanometre vicinity of materials, with the essential difference being that the fluctuating force here acts on a free electron, rather than a neutral, polarizable atom. The light emission can be shaped by controlling the nanophotonic geometry or the underlying material electromagnetic response at optical or infrared frequencies. Our results reveal ways of applying the tools of nanophotonics even at frequencies where materials have an insubstantial electromagnetic response. The process we study, when scaled up, may also enable new concepts for compact and tunable X-ray radiation.</p>",[],False,"[""Nicholas Rivera"", ""Liang Jie Wong"", ""John D.

article,Enhanced thermal Hall effect in the square-lattice Néel state,"<p>Common wisdom about conventional antiferromagnets is that their low-energy physics is governed by spin&#8211;wave excitations. However, recent experiments on several cuprate compounds have challenged this concept. An enhanced thermal Hall response in the pseudogap phase was identified, which persists even in the insulating parent compounds without doping. Here, to explain these surprising observations, we study the quantum phase transition of a square-lattice antiferromagnet from a confining N&#233;el state to a state with coexisting N&#233;el and semion topological order. The transition is driven by an applied magnetic field and involves no change in the symmetry of the state. The critical point is described by a strongly coupled conformal field theory with an emergent global SO(3) symmetry. The field theory has four different formulations in terms of SU(2) or U(1) gauge theories, which are all related by dualities; we relate all four theories to the lattice degrees of freedom. We show how proximity of the confining N&#233;el state to the critical point can explain the enhanced thermal Hall effect seen in experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Rhine Samajdar"", ""Mathias S.

article,Self-straining of actively crosslinked microtubule networks,"<p>Cytoskeletal networks are foundational examples of active matter and central to self-organized structures in the cell. In vivo, these networks are active and densely crosslinked. Relating their large-scale dynamics to the properties of their constituents remains an unsolved problem. Here, we study an in vitro active gel made from aligned microtubules and XCTK2 kinesin motors. Using photobleaching, we demonstrate that the gel&#8217;s aligned microtubules, driven by motors, continually slide past each other at a speed independent of the local microtubule polarity and motor concentration. This phenomenon is also observed, and remains unexplained, in spindles. We derive a general framework for coarse graining microtubule gels crosslinked by molecular motors from microscopic considerations. Using microtubule&#8211;microtubule coupling through a force&#8211;velocity relationship for kinesin, this theory naturally explains the experimental results: motors generate an active strain rate in regions of changing polarity, which allows microtubules of opposite polarities to slide past each other without stressing the material.</p>",[],False,"[""Sebastian F\u00fcrthauer"", ""Bezia Lemma"", ""Peter J.
