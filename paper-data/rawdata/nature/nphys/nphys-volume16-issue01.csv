letter,Anomalous decay of coherence in a dissipative many-body system,"<p>Decoherence plays a major role in our current understanding of the conceptual foundations of quantum physics. In many instances, decoherence is also a threat that must be countered (for instance, in quantum information processing or quantum technologies). While decoherence has been extensively studied for simple, well-isolated systems such as single atoms or ions, much less is known for many-body systems where interparticle correlations and interactions can drastically alter the dissipative dynamics. Here, we study experimentally the decoherence of a gas of strongly interacting bosons in an optical lattice exposed to near-resonant light and spontaneous emission. We observe an anomalous subdiffusion in momentum space, associated with a universal slowing down &#8733;1/t<sup>1/2</sup> of the loss of spatial coherence. This algebraic decay reflects the emergence of slowly relaxing many-body states, akin to the subradiant states of many excited emitters. These results, supported by theoretical predictions, provide an important benchmark in the understanding of open many-body systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Rapha\u00ebl Bouganne"", ""Manel Bosch Aguilera"", ""Alexis Ghermaoui"", ""J\u00e9r\u00f4me Beugnon"", ""Fabrice Gerbier""]","Bouganne, R., Bosch Aguilera, M., Ghermaoui, A. et al.

letter,Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of a Fermi–Hubbard system,"<p>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measures the single-particle excitations of a many-body quantum system with energy and momentum resolution, providing detailed information about strongly interacting materials. ARPES directly probes fermion pairing, and hence is a natural technique to study the development of superconductivity in systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to unitary Fermi gases. In these systems, a remnant gap-like feature persists in the normal state. Developing a quantitative understanding of these so-called pseudogap regimes may elucidate details about the pairing mechanisms that lead to superconductivity, but this is difficult in real materials partly because the microscopic Hamiltonian is not known. Here, we report on the development of ARPES to study strongly interacting fermions in an optical lattice using a quantum gas microscope. We benchmark the technique by measuring the occupied single-particle spectral function of an attractive Fermi&#8211;Hubbard system across the BCS&#8211;BEC crossover and comparing the results to those of quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We find evidence for a pseudogap that opens well above the expected critical temperature for superfluidity. This technique may also be applied to the doped repulsive Hubbard model, which is expected to exhibit a pseudogap at temperatures close to those achieved in recent experiments.</p>",[],False,"[""Peter T.

letter,Cooling and self-oscillation in a nanotube electromechanical resonator,"<p>Nanomechanical resonators are used with great success to couple mechanical motion to other degrees of freedom, such as photons, spins and electrons. The motion of a mechanical eigenmode can be efficiently cooled into the quantum regime using photons, but not other degrees of freedom. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful method for cooling, amplification and self-oscillation using electrons. This is achieved by applying a constant (d.c.) current of electrons through a suspended nanotube in a dilution refrigerator. We demonstrate cooling to 4.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2.0 quanta of vibrations. We also observe self-oscillation, which can lead to prominent instabilities in the electron transport through the nanotube. We attribute the origin of the observed cooling and self-oscillation to an electrothermal effect. This work shows that electrons may become a useful resource for cooling the mechanical vibrations of nanoscale systems into the quantum regime.</p>",[],False,"[""C. Urgell"", ""W. Yang"", ""S. L.

letter,Light-induced anomalous Hall effect in graphene,"<p>Many non-equilibrium phenomena have been discovered or predicted in optically driven quantum solids. Examples include light-induced superconductivity and Floquet-engineered topological phases. These are short-lived effects that should lead to measurable changes in electrical transport, which can be characterized using an ultrafast device architecture based on photoconductive switches. Here, we report the observation of a light-induced anomalous Hall effect in monolayer graphene driven by a femtosecond pulse of circularly polarized light. The dependence of the effect on a gate potential used to tune the Fermi level reveals multiple features that reflect a Floquet-engineered topological band structure, similar to the band structure originally proposed by Haldane. This includes an approximately 60&#8201;meV wide conductance plateau centred at the Dirac point, where a gap of equal magnitude is predicted to open. We find that when the Fermi level lies within this plateau the estimated anomalous Hall conductance saturates around 1.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.4&#8201;e<sup>2</sup>/h.</p>",[],False,"[""J. W.

letter,Observation of a ferro-rotational order coupled with second-order nonlinear optical fields,"<p>Ferroic orders can be classified by the symmetry of their order parameters, and ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and ferro-toroidal orders have already been observed. The ferro-rotational order, whose order parameter is an axial vector invariant under both time-reversal and spatial-inversion operations, is the final ferroic to be identified and has a vector order parameter. This order is closely related to a number of phenomena such as polar vortices, giant magnetoelectric coupling and spin-helicity-driven ferroelectricity, but it has received little attention so far. Here, using high-sensitivity rotational-anisotropy second-harmonic generation, we have exploited the electric quadrupole contribution to the second-harmonic generation to directly couple to this centrosymmetric ferro-rotational order in an archetype of type-II multiferroics, RbFe(MoO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. We found that two domain states with opposite ferro-rotational vectors emerge with distinct populations at the critical temperature T<sub>c</sub>&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;195&#8201;K and gradually evolve to reach an even ratio at lower temperatures. Moreover, we have identified the ferro-rotational order phase transition as weakly first order and have revealed its coupling field as a unique combination of the induced electric quadrupole second-harmonic generation and the incident fundamental electric fields.</p>",[],False,"[""Wencan Jin"", ""Elizabeth Drueke"", ""Siwen Li"", ""Alemayehu Admasu"", ""Rachel Owen"", ""Matthew Day"", ""Kai Sun"", ""Sang-Wook Cheong"", ""Liuyan Zhao""]","Jin, W., Drueke, E., Li, S. et al.

letter,Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid in the edge channels of a quantum spin Hall insulator,"<p>Quantum spin Hall insulators are two-dimensional materials that host conducting helical electron states strictly confined to the one-dimensional boundaries. These edge channels are protected by time-reversal symmetry against single-particle backscattering, opening new avenues for spin-based electronics and computation. However, the effect of the interelectronic Coulomb repulsion also has to be taken into account, as two-particle scattering is not impeded by topological protection and may strongly affect the edge state conductance. Here, we explore the impact of electronic correlations on highly localized edge states of the unique quantum spin Hall material bismuthene on SiC(0001) (ref.&#8201;). Exploiting the advantage of having an accessible monolayer substrate system, we use STM/STS to visualize the close-to-perfect one-dimensional confinement of the edge channels and scrutinize their suppressed density of states at the Fermi level. On the basis of the observed spectral behaviour and its universal scaling with energy and temperature, we demonstrate the correspondence with a (helical) Tomonaga&#8211;Luttinger liquid. In particular, the extracted interaction parameter K is directly relevant to the fundamental question of the temperatures at which the quantized conductance (a hallmark of quantum spin Hall materials) will become obscured by correlations.</p>",[],False,"[""R.

letter,Imaging emergent heavy Dirac fermions of a topological Kondo insulator,"<p>The interplay between strong electron interactions and band topology is a new frontier in the search for exotic quantum phases. The Kondo insulator SmB<sub>6</sub> has emerged as a promising platform because its correlation-driven bulk gap is predicted to host topological surface modes entangled with f electrons, spawning heavy Dirac fermions. Unlike the conventional surface states of non-interacting topological insulators, heavy Dirac fermions are expected to harbour spontaneously generated quantum anomalous Hall states, non-Abelian quantum statistics, fractionalization and topological order. However, the small energy scales required to probe heavy Dirac fermions have complicated their experimental realization. Here we use high-energy-resolution spectroscopic imaging in real and momentum space on SmB<sub>6</sub>. On cooling below 35&#8201;K, we observe the opening of an insulating gap that expands to 14&#8201;meV at 2&#8201;K. Within the gap, we image the formation of linearly dispersing surface states with effective masses reaching 410&#8201;&#177;&#8201;20&#8201;m<sub>e</sub> (where m<sub>e</sub> is the mass of the electron). Our results demonstrate the presence of correlation-driven heavy surface states in SmB<sub>6</sub>, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

letter,Overlapping and essential roles for molecular and mechanical mechanisms in mycobacterial cell division,"<p>Mechanisms to control cell division are essential for cell proliferation and survival. Bacterial cell growth and division require the coordinated activity of peptidoglycan synthases and hydrolytic enzymes to maintain mechanical integrity of the cell wall. Recent studies suggest that cell separation is governed by mechanical forces. How mechanical forces interact with molecular mechanisms to control bacterial cell division in space and time is poorly understood. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscope imaging, nanomechanical mapping and nanomanipulation to show that enzymatic activity and mechanical forces serve overlapping and essential roles in mycobacterial cell division. We find that mechanical stress gradually accumulates in the cell wall, concentrated at the future division site, culminating in rapid (millisecond) cleavage of nascent sibling cells. Inhibiting cell wall hydrolysis delays cleavage; conversely, locally increasing cell wall stress causes instantaneous and premature cleavage. Cells deficient in peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity fail to locally decrease their cell wall strength and undergo natural cleavage, instead forming chains of non-growing cells. Cleavage of these cells can be mechanically induced by local application of stress with an atomic force microscope. These findings establish a direct link between actively controlled molecular mechanisms and passively controlled mechanical forces in bacterial cell division.</p>",[],False,"[""Pascal D.

letter,Jigsaw puzzle design of pluripotent origami,"<p>Origami is rapidly transforming the design of robots, deployable structures and metamaterials. However, as foldability requires a large number of complex compatibility conditions that are difficult to satisfy, the design of crease patterns is limited to heuristics and computer optimization. Here we introduce a systematic strategy that enables intuitive and effective design of complex crease patterns that are guaranteed to fold. First, we exploit symmetries to construct 140 distinct foldable motifs, and represent these as jigsaw puzzle pieces. We then show that when these pieces are fitted together they encode foldable crease patterns. This maps origami design to solving combinatorial problems, which allows us to systematically create, count and classify a vast number of crease patterns. We show that all of these crease patterns are pluripotent&#8212;capable of folding into multiple shapes&#8212;and solve exactly for the number of possible shapes for each pattern. Finally, we employ our framework to rationally design a crease pattern that folds into two independently defined target shapes, and fabricate such pluripotent origami.

article,Microwave-to-optics conversion using a mechanical oscillator in its quantum ground state,"<p>Conversion between signals in the microwave and optical domains is of great interest both for classical telecommunication and for connecting future superconducting quantum computers into a global quantum network. For quantum applications, the conversion has to be efficient, as well as operate in a regime of minimal added classical noise. While efficient conversion has been demonstrated using mechanical transducers, they have so far all operated with a substantial thermal noise background. Here, we overcome this limitation and demonstrate coherent conversion between gigahertz microwave signals and the optical telecom band with a thermal background of less than one phonon. We use an integrated, on-chip electro-optomechanical device that couples surface acoustic waves driven by a resonant microwave signal to an optomechanical crystal featuring a 2.7&#8201;GHz mechanical mode. We initialize the mechanical mode in its quantum ground state, which allows us to perform the transduction process with minimal added thermal noise, while maintaining an optomechanical cooperativity &gt;1, so that microwave photons mapped into the mechanical resonator are effectively upconverted to the optical domain. We further verify the preservation of the coherence of the microwave signal throughout the transduction process.</p>",[],False,"[""Moritz Forsch"", ""Robert Stockill"", ""Andreas Wallucks"", ""Igor Marinkovi\u0107"", ""Claus G\u00e4rtner"", ""Richard A.

article,A coherent nanomechanical oscillator driven by single-electron tunnelling,"<p>A single-electron transistor embedded in a nanomechanical resonator represents an extreme limit of electron&#8211;phonon coupling. While it allows fast and sensitive electromechanical measurements, it also introduces back-action forces from electron tunnelling that randomly perturb the mechanical state. Despite the stochastic nature of this back-action, it has been predicted to create self-sustaining coherent mechanical oscillations under strong coupling conditions. Here, we verify this prediction using real-time measurements of a vibrating carbon nanotube transistor. This electromechanical oscillator has some similarities with a laser. The single-electron transistor pumped by an electrical bias acts as a gain medium and the resonator acts as a phonon cavity. Although the operating principle is unconventional because it does not involve stimulated emission, we confirm that the output is coherent. We demonstrate other analogues of laser behaviour, including injection locking, classical squeezing through anharmonicity and frequency narrowing through feedback.</p>",[],False,"[""Yutian Wen"", ""N.

article,Interacting topological edge channels,"<p>Electrical currents in a quantum spin Hall insulator are confined to the boundary of the system. The charge carriers behave as massless relativistic particles whose spin and momentum are coupled to each other. Although the helical character of those states is already established by experiments, there is an open question regarding how those edge states interact with each other when they are brought into close spatial proximity. We employ an inverted HgTe quantum well to guide edge channels from opposite sides of a device into a quasi-one-dimensional constriction. Our transport measurements show that, apart from the expected quantization in integer steps of 2e<sup>2</sup>/h, we find an additional plateau at e<sup>2</sup>/h. We combine band structure calculations and repulsive electron&#8211;electron interaction effects captured within the Tomonaga&#8211;Luttinger liquid model and Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling to explain our observation in terms of the opening of a spin gap. These results may have direct implications for the study of one-dimensional helical electron quantum optics, and for understanding Majorana and para fermions.</p>",[],False,"[""Jonas Strunz"", ""Jonas Wiedenmann"", ""Christoph Fleckenstein"", ""Lukas Lunczer"", ""Wouter Beugeling"", ""Valentin L.

article,Quenched nematic criticality and two superconducting domes in an iron-based superconductor,"<p>The nematic electronic state and its associated critical fluctuations have emerged as a potential candidate for the superconducting pairing in various unconventional superconductors. However, in most materials their coexistence with magnetically ordered phases poses a significant challenge in determining their importance. Here, by combining chemical and hydrostatic physical pressure in FeSe<sub>0.89</sub>S<sub>0.11</sub>, we access a nematic quantum phase transition isolated from any other competing magnetic phases. From quantum oscillations in high magnetic fields, we trace the evolution of the Fermi surface and electronic correlations as a function of applied pressure and detect a Lifshitz transition that separates two distinct superconducting regions. One emerges from the nematic phase with a small Fermi surface and strong electronic correlations, while the other one has a large Fermi surface and weak correlations that promotes nesting and stabilization of a magnetically ordered phase at high pressures. The absence of mass divergence at the nematic quantum phase transition suggests that the nematic fluctuations could be quenched by the strong coupling to the lattice or local strain effects. A direct consequence is the weakening of superconductivity at the nematic quantum phase transition in the absence of magnetically driven fluctuations.</p>",[],False,"[""Pascal Reiss"", ""David Graf"", ""Amir A.

article,The energy cost and optimal design for synchronization of coupled molecular oscillators,"<p>A model of coupled molecular biochemical oscillators is proposed to study non-equilibrium thermodynamics of synchronization. Under general considerations, we find that chemical interactions within an ensemble of autonomous oscillators break detailed balance and thus cost energy. This extra energy cost, in addition to the energy dissipated for driving each individual oscillator, is necessary to power the coupling interactions such as oscillator&#8211;oscillator exchange reactions, which are responsible for correcting the phase error in each individual noisy oscillator with respect to the collective oscillation of the whole ensemble. By solving the steady-state distribution of the many-oscillator system analytically and numerically, we show that the system reaches its synchronized state through a non-equilibrium phase transition as energy dissipation increases. The critical energy dissipation per period depends on both the frequency and strength of the exchange reaction, which reveals an optimal (efficient) design for achieving maximum synchronization with a fixed energy budget. We apply our general theory to the Kai system in the cyanobacterial circadian clock and predict a relationship between the KaiC ATPase activity and synchronization of the KaiC hexamers. The theoretical framework established here can be extended to study thermodynamics of collective behaviours in other non-equilibrium active systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Dongliang Zhang"", ""Yuansheng Cao"", ""Qi Ouyang"", ""Yuhai Tu""]","Zhang, D., Cao, Y., Ouyang, Q. et al.

article,"Cell swelling, softening and invasion in a three-dimensional breast cancer model","<p>Control of the structure and function of three-dimensional multicellular tissues depends critically on the spatial and temporal coordination of cellular physical properties, yet the organizational principles that govern these events and their disruption in disease remain poorly understood. Using a multicellular mammary cancer organoid model, we map here the spatial and temporal evolution of positions, motions and physical characteristics of individual cells in three dimensions. Compared with cells in the organoid core, cells at the organoid periphery and the invasive front are found to be systematically softer, larger and more dynamic. These mechanical changes are shown to arise from supracellular fluid flow through gap junctions, the suppression of which delays the transition to an invasive phenotype. These findings highlight the role of spatiotemporal coordination of cellular physical properties in tissue organization and disease progression.</p>",[],False,"[""Yu Long Han"", ""Adrian F.
