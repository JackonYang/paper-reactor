review article,Many-body physics with individually controlled Rydberg atoms,"<p>Recent decades have witnessed great developments in the field of quantum simulation&#8212;where synthetic systems are built and studied to gain insight into complicated, many-body real-world problems. Systems of individually controlled neutral atoms, interacting with each other when excited to Rydberg states, have emerged as a promising platform for this task, particularly for the simulation of spin systems. Here, we review the techniques necessary for the manipulation of neutral atoms for the purpose of quantum simulation&#8212;such as quantum gas microscopes and arrays of optical tweezers&#8212;and explain how the different types of interactions between Rydberg atoms allow a natural mapping onto various quantum spin models.

letter,Non-Gaussian quantum states of a multimode light field,"<p>Advanced quantum technologies require scalable and controllable quantum resources. Gaussian states of multimode light, such as squeezed states and cluster states, are scalable quantum systems, which can be generated on demand. However, non-Gaussian features are indispensable in many quantum protocols, especially to reach a quantum computational advantage. Embodying non-Gaussianity in a multimode quantum state remains a challenge as non-Gaussian operations generally cannot maintain coherence among multiple modes. Here, we generate non-Gaussian quantum states of a multimode light field by removing a single photon in a mode-selective manner from a Gaussian state. To highlight the potential for continuous-variable quantum technologies, we first demonstrated the capability to generate negativity of the Wigner function in a controlled mode. Subsequently, we explored the interplay between non-Gaussianity and quantum entanglement and verify a theoretical prediction about the propagation of non-Gaussianity along the nodes of photon-subtracted cluster states. Our results demonstrate large-scale non-Gaussianity with great flexibility along with an ensured compatibility with quantum information protocols. This range of features makes our approach ideal to explore the physics of non-Gaussian entanglement and to develop quantum protocols, which range across quantum computing, entanglement distillation and quantum simulations.</p>",[],False,"[""Young-Sik Ra"", ""Adrien Dufour"", ""Mattia Walschaers"", ""Cl\u00e9ment Jacquard"", ""Thibault Michel"", ""Claude Fabre"", ""Nicolas Treps""]","Ra, YS., Dufour, A., Walschaers, M. et al.

letter,Chip-to-chip quantum teleportation and multi-photon entanglement in silicon,"<p>Integrated optics provides a versatile platform for quantum information processing and transceiving with photons. The implementation of quantum protocols requires the capability to generate multiple high-quality single photons and process photons with multiple high-fidelity operators. However, previous experimental demonstrations were faced by major challenges in realizing sufficiently high-quality multi-photon sources and multi-qubit operators in a single integrated system, and fully chip-based implementations of multi-qubit quantum tasks remain a significant challenge. Here, we report the demonstration of chip-to-chip quantum teleportation and genuine multipartite entanglement, the core functionalities in quantum technologies, on silicon-photonic circuitry. Four single photons with high purity and indistinguishablity are produced in an array of microresonator sources, without requiring any spectral filtering. Up to four qubits are processed in a reprogrammable linear-optic quantum circuit that facilitates Bell projection and fusion operation. The generation, processing, transceiving and measurement of multi-photon multi-qubit states are all achieved in micrometre-scale silicon chips, fabricated by the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor process.

letter,Solids of quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene,"<p>Partially filled Landau levels host competing electronic orders. For example, electron solids may prevail close to integer filling of the Landau levels before giving way to fractional quantum Hall liquids at higher carrier density. Here, we report the observation of an electron solid with non-collinear spin texture in monolayer graphene, consistent with solidification of skyrmions&#8212;topological spin textures characterized by quantized electrical charge. We probe the spin texture of the solids using a modified Corbino geometry that allows ferromagnetic magnons to be launched and detected. We find that magnon transport is highly efficient when one Landau level is filled (\(\nu =1\)), consistent with quantum Hall ferromagnetic spin polarization. However, even minimal doping immediately quenches the magnon signal while leaving the vanishing low-temperature charge conductivity unchanged. Our results can be understood by the formation of a solid of charged skyrmions near \(\nu =1\), whose non-collinear spin texture leads to rapid magnon decay. Data near fractional fillings show evidence of several fractional skyrmion solids, suggesting that graphene hosts a highly tunable landscape of coupled spin and charge orders.</p>",[],False,"[""H.

letter,Light-induced charge density wave in LaTe3,"<p>When electrons in a solid are excited by light, they can alter the free energy landscape and access phases of matter that are out of reach in thermal equilibrium. This accessibility becomes important in the presence of phase competition, when one state of matter is preferred over another by only a small energy scale that, in principle, is surmountable by the excitation. Here, we study a layered compound, LaTe<sub>3</sub>, where a small lattice anisotropy in the a&#8211;c plane results in a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) along the c axis. Using ultrafast electron diffraction, we find that, after photoexcitation, the CDW along the c axis is weakened and a different competing CDW along the a axis subsequently emerges. The timescales characterizing the relaxation of this new CDW and the reestablishment of the original CDW are nearly identical, which points towards a strong competition between the two orders. The new density wave represents a transient non-equilibrium phase of matter with no equilibrium counterpart, and this study thus provides a framework for discovering similar states of matter that are &#8216;trapped&#8217; under equilibrium conditions.</p>",[],False,"[""Anshul Kogar"", ""Alfred Zong"", ""Pavel E.

letter,Nanoscale imaging of equilibrium quantum Hall edge currents and of the magnetic monopole response in graphene,"<p>Although the recently predicted topological magnetoelectric effect and the response to an electric charge that mimics an induced mirror magnetic monopole are fundamental attributes of topological states of matter with broken time-reversal symmetry, so far they have not been directly observed in experiments. Using a SQUID-on-tip, acting simultaneously as a tunable scanning electric charge and as an ultrasensitive nanoscale magnetometer, we induce and directly image the microscopic currents generating the magnetic monopole response in a graphene quantum Hall electron system. We find a rich and complex nonlinear behaviour, governed by the coexistence of topological and non-topological equilibrium currents, that is not captured by the monopole models. Furthermore, by imaging the equilibrium currents of individual quantum Hall edge states, we reveal that the edge states, which are commonly assumed to carry only a chiral downstream current, in fact carry a pair of counterpropagating currents, in which the topological downstream current in the incompressible region is counterbalanced by a non-topological upstream current flowing in the adjacent compressible region. The intricate patterns of the counterpropagating equilibrium-state orbital currents provide insights into the microscopic origins of the topological and non-topological charge and energy flow in quantum Hall systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Aviram Uri"", ""Youngwook Kim"", ""Kousik Bagani"", ""Cyprian K.

letter,Long-range ballistic propagation of carriers in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite thin films,"<p>The performance of semiconductor devices is fundamentally governed by charge-carrier dynamics within the active materials. Although advances have been made towards understanding these dynamics under steady-state conditions, the importance of non-equilibrium phenomena and their effect on device performances remains elusive. In fact, the ballistic propagation of carriers is generally considered to not contribute to the mechanism of photovoltaics (PVs) and light-emitting diodes, as scattering rapidly disrupts such processes after carrier generation via photon absorption or electric injection. Here we characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of carriers immediately after photon absorption in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite films using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy (fs-TAM) with a 10&#8201;fs temporal resolution and 10&#8201;nm spatial precision. We found that non-equilibrium carriers propagate ballistically over 150&#8201;nm within 20&#8201;fs of photon absorption. Our results suggest that in a typical perovskite PV device operating under standard conditions, a large fraction of carriers can reach the charge collection layers ballistically. The ballistic transport distance appears to be limited by energetic disorder within the materials, probably due to disorder-induced scattering. This provides a direct route towards optimization of the ballistic transport distance via improvements in materials and by minimizing the energetic disorder. Our observations reveal an unexplored regime of carrier transport in perovskites, which could have important consequences for device performance.</p>",[],False,"[""Jooyoung Sung"", ""Christoph Schnedermann"", ""Limeng Ni"", ""Aditya Sadhanala"", ""Richard Y.

The challenges in an experimental realization lie in determining the effective area of special pressure balances and in accounting for the pressure distortion. Comparisons of the mechanical pressure standard with independent methods to exclude sources of systematic uncertainty are currently available only around 0.1&#8201;MPa at the required uncertainty levels. Here, such an independent cross-check is performed up to 7&#8201;MPa based on electrical measurements of helium gas. Enabled by recent progress in ab initio calculations, pressure can be accessed through measurement of the dielectric constant. By using theoretical values for the polarizability and the virial coefficients of helium, the change in capacitance and hence the pressure can be determined up to 7&#8201;MPa. The relative uncertainty of this method is below 5&#8201;ppm and can serve as a new primary pressure standard complementary to the mechanical pressure standard.

letter,Impact of the Langdon effect on crossed-beam energy transfer,"<p>The prediction that laser plasma heating distorts the electron distribution function away from Maxwellian and towards a super-Gaussian distribution dates back four decades. In conditions relevant to inertial confinement fusion, however, no direct evidence of this so-called &#8216;Langdon effect&#8217; has previously been observed. Here we present measurements of the spatially and temporally resolved Thomson scattering spectrum that indicate the presence of super-Gaussian electron distribution functions consistent with existing theory. In such plasmas, ion acoustic wave frequencies increase monotonically with the super-Gaussian exponent. Our results show that the measured power transfer between crossed laser beams mediated by ion acoustic waves requires a model that accounts for the non-Maxwellian electron distribution function, whereas the standard Maxwellian calculations overpredict power transfer over a wide region of parameter space. Including this effect is expected to improve the predictive capability of crossed-beam energy transfer modelling at the National Ignition Facility in California and may restore a larger operable design space for inertial confinement fusion experiments. This is also expected to motivate further inquiry in other areas affected by non-Maxwellian electron distribution functions, such as laser absorption, heat transport and X-ray spectroscopy.</p>",[],False,"[""David Turnbull"", ""Arnaud Cola\u00eftis"", ""Aaron M.

letter,Negative representation and instability in democratic elections,"<p>The challenge of understanding the collective behaviours of social systems can benefit from methods and concepts from physics, not because humans are similar to electrons, but because certain large-scale behaviours can be understood without an understanding of the small-scale details, in much the same way that sound waves can be understood without an understanding of atoms. Democratic elections are one such behaviour. Over the past few decades, physicists have explored scaling patterns in voting and the dynamics of political opinion formation (for example, see refs. ). Here, we define the concepts of negative representation, in which a shift in electorate opinions produces a shift in the election outcome in the opposite direction, and electoral instability, in which an arbitrarily small change in electorate opinions can dramatically swing the election outcome, and prove that unstable elections necessarily contain negatively represented opinions. Furthermore, in the presence of low voter turnout, increasing polarization of the electorate can drive elections through a transition from a stable to an unstable regime, analogous to the phase transition by which some materials become ferromagnetic below their critical temperatures. Empirical data suggest that the United States&#8217; presidential elections underwent such a phase transition in the 1970s and have since become increasingly unstable.</p>",[],False,"[""Alexander F.

article,Deeply virtual Compton scattering off the neutron,"<p>The three-dimensional structure of nucleons (protons and neutrons) is embedded in so-called generalized parton distributions, which are accessible from deeply virtual Compton scattering. In this process, a high-energy electron is scattered off a nucleon by exchanging a virtual photon. Then, a highly energetic real photon is emitted from one of the quarks inside the nucleon, which carries information on the quark&#8217;s transverse position and longitudinal momentum. By measuring the cross-section of deeply virtual Compton scattering, Compton form factors related to the generalized parton distributions can be extracted. Here, we report the observation of unpolarized deeply virtual Compton scattering off a deuterium target. From the measured photon-electroproduction cross-sections, we have extracted the cross-section of a quasifree neutron and a coherent deuteron. Due to the approximate isospin symmetry of quantum chromodynamics, we can determine the contributions from the different quark flavours to the helicity-conserved Compton form factors by combining our measurements with previous ones probing the proton&#8217;s internal structure. These results advance our understanding of the description of the nucleon structure, which is important to solve the proton spin puzzle.</p>",[],False,"[""M. Benali"", ""C. Desnault"", ""M.

article,Accessing scrambling using matrix product operators,"<p>Scrambling, a process in which quantum information spreads over a complex quantum system, becoming inaccessible to simple probes, occurs in generic chaotic quantum many-body systems, ranging from spin chains to metals and even to black holes. Scrambling can be measured using out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), which are closely tied to the growth of Heisenberg operators. We present a general method to calculate OTOCs of local operators in one-dimensional systems based on approximating Heisenberg operators as matrix product operators (MPOs). Contrary to the common belief that such tensor network methods work only at early times, we show that the entire early growth region of the OTOC can be captured using an MPO approximation with modest bond dimension. We analytically establish the goodness of the approximation by showing that, if an appropriate OTOC is close to its initial value, then the associated Heisenberg operator has low entanglement across a given cut. We use the method to study scrambling in a chaotic spin chain with \(201\) sites. On the basis of these data and previous results, we conjecture a universal form for the dynamics of the OTOC near the wavefront. We show that this form collapses the chaotic spin chain data over more than 15 orders of magnitude.</p>",[],False,"[""Shenglong Xu"", ""Brian Swingle""]","Xu, S., Swingle, B.

article,Determining eigenstates and thermal states on a quantum computer using quantum imaginary time evolution,"<p>The accurate computation of Hamiltonian ground, excited and thermal states on quantum computers stands to impact many problems in the physical and computer sciences, from quantum simulation to machine learning. Given the challenges posed in constructing large-scale quantum computers, these tasks should be carried out in a resource-efficient way. In this regard, existing techniques based on phase estimation or variational algorithms display potential disadvantages; phase estimation requires deep circuits with ancillae, that are hard to execute reliably without error correction, while variational algorithms, while flexible with respect to circuit depth, entail additional high-dimensional classical optimization. Here, we introduce the quantum imaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, which are analogues of classical algorithms for finding ground and excited states. Compared with their classical counterparts, they require exponentially less space and time per iteration, and can be implemented without deep circuits and ancillae, or high-dimensional optimization. We furthermore discuss quantum imaginary time evolution as a subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analogue of minimally entangled typical thermal states. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms via an implementation using exact classical emulation as well as through prototype circuits on the Rigetti quantum virtual machine and Aspen-1 quantum processing unit.</p>",[],True,"[""Mario Motta"", ""Chong Sun"", ""Adrian T.

article,Quantum control of an oscillator using a stimulated Josephson nonlinearity,"<p>Superconducting circuits extensively rely on the Josephson junction as a nonlinear electronic element for manipulating quantum information and mediating photon interactions. Despite continuing efforts in pushing the coherence of Josephson circuits, the best photon lifetimes have been demonstrated in microwave cavities. Nevertheless, architectures based on quantum memories require a qubit element for logical operations at the cost of introducing additional loss channels and limiting process fidelities. Here, we directly operate the oscillator as an isolated two-level system by tailoring its Hilbert space. Implementing a flux-tunable inductive coupling between two resonators, we can selectively Rabi drive the lowest eigenstates by dynamically activating a three-wave interaction through parametric flux modulation. Measuring the Wigner function confirms that we can prepare arbitrary states confined in the single-photon manifold, with measured coherence times limited by the oscillator intrinsic quality factor. This architectural shift in engineering oscillators with stimulated nonlinearity can be exploited for designing long-lived quantum modules and offers flexibility in studying non-equilibrium physics with photons in a field-programmable simulator.</p>",[],False,"[""Andrei Vrajitoarea"", ""Ziwen Huang"", ""Peter Groszkowski"", ""Jens Koch"", ""Andrew A.

Here we report characterization of the local electronic properties of single- and few-layer 1T-TaSe<sub>2</sub> via spatial- and momentum-resolved spectroscopy involving scanning tunnelling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission. Our results indicate that electron correlation induces a robust Mott insulator state in single-layer 1T-TaSe<sub>2</sub> that is accompanied by unusual orbital texture. Interlayer coupling weakens the insulating phase, as shown by reduction of the energy gap and quenching of the correlation-driven orbital texture in bilayer and trilayer 1T-TaSe<sub>2</sub>.

article,Electrical charging overcomes the bouncing barrier in planet formation,"<p>In protoplanetary disks, solid objects (so-called planetesimals) are formed from dust. Micrometre-sized dust grains grow into millimetre-sized aggregates. Once those aggregates have diameters exceeding a few centimetres, they become subject to concentration mechanisms such as the streaming instability, permitting the formation of self-gravitating clusters, which might eventually collapse into kilometre-sized planetesimals. However, for the streaming instability to set in, clumps spanning sizes from centimetres to decimetres are required in the centre of a protoplanetary disk. In the size range between millimetres and centimetres, aggregates bounce off each other rather than sticking together, and growth is stalled. Here we show in microgravity experiments that collisions between millimetre-sized grains lead to sufficient electrical charging for aggregation to bridge this gap between the bouncing barrier and the onset of the streaming instability. We computationally simulate aggregation and find that models agree with the experimental data only if electrical charging is present. We therefore propose that collisional charging may promote early growth in the size gap that current models of planetesimal formation cannot account for.</p>",[],False,"[""Tobias Steinpilz"", ""Kolja Joeris"", ""Felix Jungmann"", ""Dietrich Wolf"", ""Lothar Brendel"", ""Jens Teiser"", ""Troy Shinbrot"", ""Gerhard Wurm""]","Steinpilz, T., Joeris, K., Jungmann, F. et al.
