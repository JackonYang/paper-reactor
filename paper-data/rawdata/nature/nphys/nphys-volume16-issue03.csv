review article,Quantum information processing and quantum optics with circuit quantum electrodynamics,"<p>Since the first observation of coherent quantum behaviour in a superconducting qubit, now more than 20 years ago, there have been substantial developments in the field of superconducting quantum circuits. One such advance is the introduction of the concepts of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) to superconducting circuits, to yield what is now known as circuit QED. This approach realizes in a single architecture the essential requirements for quantum computation, and has already been used to run simple quantum algorithms and to operate tens of superconducting qubits simultaneously. For these reasons, circuit QED is one of the leading architectures for quantum computation. In parallel to these advances towards quantum information processing, circuit QED offers new opportunities for the exploration of the rich physics of quantum optics in novel parameter regimes in which strongly nonlinear effects are readily visible at the level of individual microwave photons. We review circuit QED in the context of quantum information processing and quantum optics, and discuss some of the challenges on the road towards scalable quantum computation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Institut quantique, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada', 'authors': ['Alexandre Blais']}, {'address': 'Département de Physique, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada', 'authors': ['Alexandre Blais']}, {'address': 'Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Toronto, Ontario, Canada', 'authors': ['Alexandre Blais']}, {'address': 'Department of Physics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA', 'authors': ['Steven M.

review article,Hybrid quantum systems with circuit quantum electrodynamics,"<p>The rise of quantum information science has provided new perspectives on quantum mechanics, as well as a common language for quantum engineering. The focus on platforms for the manipulation and processing of quantum information bridges between different research areas in physics as well as other disciplines. Such a crossover between borders is well embodied by the development of hybrid quantum systems, where heterogeneous physical systems are combined to leverage their individual strengths for the implementation of novel functionalities. In the microwave domain, the hybridization of various quantum degrees of freedom has been tremendously helped by superconducting quantum circuits, owing to their large zero-point field fluctuations, small dissipation, strong nonlinearity and design flexibility. These efforts take place by expanding the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics. Here, we review recent research on the creation of hybrid quantum systems based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, encompassing mechanical oscillators, quantum acoustodynamics with surface acoustic waves, quantum magnonics and coupling between superconducting circuits and ensembles or single spins.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA', 'authors': ['A.

review article,Photonic materials in circuit quantum electrodynamics,"<p>Photonic synthetic materials provide an opportunity to explore the role of microscopic quantum phenomena in determining macroscopic material properties. There are, however, fundamental obstacles to overcome &#8212; in vacuum, photons not only lack mass, but also do not naturally interact with one another. Here, we review how the superconducting quantum circuit platform has been harnessed in the last decade to make some of the first materials from light. We describe the structures that are used to imbue individual microwave photons with matter-like properties such as mass, the nonlinear elements that mediate interactions between these photons, and quantum dynamic/thermodynamic approaches that can be used to assemble and stabilize strongly correlated states of many photons. We then describe state-of-the-art techniques to generate synthetic magnetic fields, engineer topological and non-topological flat bands and explore the physics of quantum materials in non-Euclidean geometries &#8212; directions that we view as some of the most exciting for this burgeoning field. Finally, we discuss upcoming prospects, and in particular opportunities to probe novel aspects of quantum thermalization and detect quasi-particles with exotic anyonic statistics, as well as potential applications in quantum information science.</p>",,"[{'address': 'INO-CNR BEC Center and Dipartimento di Fisica, Università di Trento, Trento, Italy', 'authors': ['Iacopo Carusotto']}, {'address': 'Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA', 'authors': ['Andrew A.

letter,Distributed quantum sensing in a continuous-variable entangled network,"<p>Networking is integral to quantum communications and has significant potential for upscaling quantum computer technologies. Recently, it was realized that the sensing performances of multiple spatially distributed parameters may also be enhanced through the use of an entangled quantum network. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how sensing of an averaged phase shift among four distributed nodes benefits from an entangled quantum network. Using a four-mode entangled continuous-variable state, we demonstrate deterministic quantum phase sensing with a precision beyond what is attainable with separable probes. The techniques behind this result can have direct applications in a number of areas ranging from molecular tracking to quantum networks of atomic clocks.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Center for Macroscopic Quantum States (bigQ), Department of Physics, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark', 'authors': ['Xueshi Guo', ',\xa0Casper R.

letter,Spectromicroscopic measurement of surface and bulk band structure interplay in a disordered topological insulator,"<p>Topological insulators are bulk semiconductors that manifest in-gap surface states with massless Dirac-like dispersion due to the topological bulk-boundary correspondence principle. These surface states can be manipulated by the interface environment to display various emergent phenomena. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy to investigate the interplay of crystallographic inhomogeneity with the topologically ordered band structure in a model topological insulator. We develop quantitative analysis methods to obtain spectroscopic information, in spite of a limited dwell time on each measured point. We find that the band energies vary on the scale of 50&#8201;meV across the sample surface, and this enables single sample measurements that are analogous to a multi-sample doping series. By focusing separately on the bulk and surface electrons we reveal a hybridization-like interplay between fluctuations in the surface and bulk state energetics.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Physics, New York University, New York, NY, USA', 'authors': ['Erica Kotta', ',\xa0Lin Miao', ',\xa0Yishuai Xu', ',\xa0S.

letter,Spin-orbit-controlled metal–insulator transition in Sr2IrO4,"<p>In the context of correlated insulators, where electron&#8211;electron interactions (U) drive the localization of charge carriers, the metal&#8211;insulator transition is described as either bandwidth- or filling-controlled. Motivated by the challenge of the insulating phase in Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>, a new class of correlated insulators has been proposed, in which spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) is believed to renormalize the bandwidth of the half-filled j<sub>eff</sub> = 1/2 doublet, allowing a modest U to induce a charge-localized phase. Although this framework has been tacitly assumed, a thorough characterization of the ground state has been elusive. Furthermore, direct evidence for the role of SOC in stabilizing the insulating state has not been established, because previous attempts at revealing the role of SOC have been hindered by concurrently occurring changes to the filling. We overcome this challenge by employing multiple substituents that introduce well-defined changes to the signatures of SOC and carrier concentration in the electronic structure, as well as a new methodology that allows us to monitor SOC directly. Specifically, we study Sr<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>T<sub>x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (T&#8201;=&#8201;Ru, Rh) by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, combined with ab initio and supercell tight-binding calculations. This allows us to distinguish relativistic and filling effects, thereby establishing conclusively the central role of SOC in stabilizing the insulating state of Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>. Most importantly, we estimate the critical value for SOC in this system to be &#955;<sub>c</sub> = 0.42 &#177; 0.01&#8201;eV, and provide the first demonstration of a spin&#8211;orbit-controlled metal&#8211;insulator transition.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Quantum Matter Institute, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada', 'authors': ['B.

letter,Crossover from two-dimensional to three-dimensional superconducting states in bismuth-based cuprate superconductor,"<p>To decipher the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, it is important to know how the superconducting pairing emerges from the unusual normal states of cuprate superconductors, including the pseudogap, strange metal and anomalous Fermi liquid phases. A long-standing issue is how the superconducting pairing is formed and condensed in the strange metal phase, because this is where the superconducting transition temperature is highest. Here, we use state-of-the-art high-pressure measurements to report the experimental observation of a pressure-induced crossover from two- to three-dimensional (2D to 3D) superconducting states in optimally doped Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8&#8201;+&#8201;&#948;</sub> bulk superconductor. By analysing the temperature dependence of the resistance, we find that the 2D superconducting transition exhibits a Berezinskii&#8211;Kosterlitz&#8211;Thouless-like behaviour. The emergence of this 2D superconducting transition provides direct evidence that the strange metal state is predominantly 2D-like.

letter,Observation of exciton polariton condensation in a perovskite lattice at room temperature,"<p>Exciton polaritons, with extremely low effective mass, are regarded as promising candidates to realize Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation in lattices for quantum simulations towards room-temperature operations. Along with the condensation, an efficient exciton polariton quantum simulator would require a strong lattice with robust polariton trapping as well as strong intersite coupling to allow coherent quantum motion of polaritons within the lattice. A strong lattice can be characterized with a larger forbidden bandgap opening and a larger lattice bandwidth compared with the linewidth. However, exciton polaritons in such strong lattices have only been shown to condense at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we report the observation of non-equilibrium exciton polariton condensation in a one-dimensional strong lead halide perovskite lattice at room temperature. Modulated by deep periodic potentials, the strong lead halide perovskite lattice exhibits a large forbidden bandgap opening up to 13.3&#8201;meV and a lattice band up to 8.5&#8201;meV wide, which are at least 10 times larger than previous systems. Above a critical density, we observe polariton condensation into p<sub>y</sub> orbital states with long-range spatial coherence at room temperature. Our result opens the route to the implementation of polariton condensates in quantum simulators at room temperature.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Division of Physics and Applied Physics, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore', 'authors': ['Rui Su', ',\xa0Sanjib Ghosh', ',\xa0Jun Wang', ',\xa0Sheng Liu', ',\xa0Timothy C.

letter,Topological defects produce exotic mechanics in complex metamaterials,"<p>The basic tenet of metamaterials is that the architecture controls the physics. So far, most studies have considered defect-free architectures. However, defects, and particularly topological defects, play a crucial role in natural materials. Here we provide a systematic strategy for introducing such defects in mechanical metamaterials. We first present metamaterials that are a mechanical analogue of spin systems with tunable ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, then design an exponential number of frustration-free metamaterials and finally introduce topological defects by rotating a string of building blocks in these metamaterials. We uncover the distinct mechanical signature of topological defects using experiments and simulations, and leverage this to design complex metamaterials in which external forces steer deformations and stresses towards complementary parts of the system.

letter,Dynein harnesses active fluctuations of microtubules for faster movement,"<p>The cytoskeleton forms a dynamic network that generates fluctuations larger than thermal agitation of the cytoplasm. Here, we tested whether dynein, a minus-end-directed microtubule (MT) motor, can harness energy from these fluctuations using optical trapping in vitro. We show that dynein forms an asymmetric slip bond with MTs, where its detachment rate increases more slowly under hindering forces than assisting forces. This asymmetry enables dynein to generate unidirectional motility towards the minus-end from force fluctuations. Consistent with our model, oscillatory forces exerted by the trap drive dynein stepping without net force and ATP. Dynein is capable of ratcheting towards the minus-end, even when the net force is in the plus-end direction. With ATP, force oscillations increase the velocity and stall force of dynein as it transports cargos and glides MTs. Therefore, dynein is a mechanical ratchet that rectifies cytoskeletal fluctuations to move faster and resists higher forces along MTs.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Physics Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Yasin Ezber', ',\xa0Sinan Can', '\xa0&\xa0Ahmet Yildiz']}, {'address': 'Biophysics Graduate Group, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Vladislav Belyy', '\xa0&\xa0Ahmet Yildiz']}, {'address': 'The Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Ahmet Yildiz']}]",False,"['Yasin Ezber', 'Vladislav Belyy', 'Sinan Can', 'Ahmet Yildiz']","Ezber, Y., Belyy, V., Can, S. et al.

letter,Near-Earth magnetotail reconnection powers space storms,"<p>Space storms are the dominant contributor to space weather. During storms, rearrangement of the solar wind and Earth&#8217;s magnetic field lines at the dayside enhances global plasma circulation in the magnetosphere. As this circulation proceeds, energy is dissipated into heat in the ionosphere and near-Earth space. As Earth&#8217;s dayside magnetic flux is eroded during this process, magnetotail reconnection must occur to replenish it. However, whether dissipation is powered by magnetotail (nightside) reconnection, as in storms&#8217; weaker but more commonplace relatives, substorms, or by enhanced global plasma circulation driven by dayside reconnection is unknown. Here we show that magnetotail reconnection near geosynchronous orbit powered an intense storm. Near-Earth reconnection at geocentric distances of ~6.6&#8211;10 Earth radii&#8212;probably driven by the enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure and southward magnetic field&#8212;is observed from multi-satellite data. In this region, magnetic reconnection was expected to be suppressed by Earth&#8217;s strong dipole field. Revealing the physical processes that power storms and the solar wind conditions responsible for them opens a new window into our understanding of space storms. It encourages future exploration of the storm-time equatorial near-Earth magnetotail to refine storm driver models and accelerate progress towards space weather prediction.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, and Institute of Geophysics and Space Physics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Vassilis Angelopoulos', '\xa0&\xa0Anton Artemyev']}, {'address': 'Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA', 'authors': ['Tai D.

article,Variational quantum unsampling on a quantum photonic processor,"<p>A promising route towards the demonstration of near-term quantum advantage (or supremacy) over classical systems relies on running tailored quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum machines. These algorithms typically involve sampling from probability distributions that&#8212;under plausible complexity-theoretic conjectures&#8212;cannot be efficiently generated classically. Rather than determining the computational features of output states produced by a given physical system, we investigate what features of the generating system can be efficiently learnt given direct access to an output state. To tackle this question, here we introduce the variational quantum unsampling protocol, a nonlinear quantum neural network approach for verification and inference of near-term quantum circuit outputs. In our approach, one can variationally train a quantum operation to unravel the action of an unknown unitary on a known input state, essentially learning the inverse of the black-box quantum dynamics. While the principle of our approach is platform independent, its implementation will depend on the unique architecture of a specific quantum processor. We experimentally demonstrate the variational quantum unsampling protocol on a quantum photonic processor. Alongside quantum verification, our protocol has broad applications, including optimal quantum measurement and tomography, quantum sensing and imaging, and ansatz validation.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA', 'authors': ['Jacques Carolan', ',\xa0Mihika Prabhu', ',\xa0Changchen Chen', ',\xa0Darius Bunandar', ',\xa0Franco N.

article,Echo in a single vibrationally excited molecule,"<p>Echoes occur in many physical systems, typically in inhomogeneously broadened ensembles of nonlinear objects. They are often used to eliminate the effects of dephasing caused by interactions with the environment as well as to enable the observation of proper, inherent object properties. Here, we report the experimental observation of quantum wave-packet echoes in a single, isolated molecule. The entire dephasing&#8211;rephasing cycle occurs without any inhomogeneous spread of molecular properties, or any interaction with the environment, and offers a way to probe the internal coherent dynamics of single molecules. In our experiments, we impulsively excite a vibrational wave packet in an anharmonic molecular potential and observe its oscillations and eventual dispersion with time. A second, delayed pulse gives rise to an echo&#8212;a partial recovery of the initial coherent oscillations. The vibrational dynamics of single molecules is visualized by a time-delayed probe pulse dissociating them, one at a time. Two mechanisms for the echo formation are discussed: a.c. Stark-induced molecular potential shaking and creation of a depletion-induced &#8216;hole&#8217; in the nuclear spatial distribution.

article,Electromagnetically induced transparency at a chiral exceptional point,"<p>Electromagnetically induced transparency, as a quantum interference effect to eliminate optical absorption in an opaque medium, has found extensive applications in slow-light generation, optical storage, frequency conversion, optical quantum memory and enhanced nonlinear interactions at the few-photon level in all kinds of systems. Recently, there has been great interest in exceptional points, a type of spectral singularity that could be reached by tuning various parameters in open systems, to render unusual features to the physical systems, such as optical states with chirality. Here we theoretically and experimentally study transparency and absorption modulated by chiral optical states at exceptional points in an indirectly coupled resonator system. By tuning one resonator to an exceptional point, transparency or absorption occurs depending on the chirality of the eigenstate. Our results demonstrate a new strategy to manipulate the light flow and the spectra of a photonic resonator system by exploiting a discrete optical state associated with a specific chirality at an exceptional point as a unique control bit. Such an approach is compatible with the state control utilized in quantum gate operation and may open up new avenues for controlling slow light using optical states for optical quantum memory and computing.</p>",,"[{'address': 'Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA', 'authors': ['Changqing Wang', ',\xa0Xuefeng Jiang', ',\xa0Guangming Zhao', ',\xa0Bo Peng', '\xa0&\xa0Lan Yang']}, {'address': 'Departments of Applied Physics and Physics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA', 'authors': ['Mengzhen Zhang', ',\xa0Chia Wei Hsu', ',\xa0A.

In this context, by employing near-infrared single-cycle pulse pairs, we measure interferometric autocorrelations of the ultrafast currents induced by optical field emission at the nanogap of a single plasmonic nanocircuit. The dynamics of this ultrafast electron nanotransport depends on the precise temporal field profile of the optical driving pulse. Current autocorrelations are acquired with sub-femtosecond temporal resolution as a function of both pulse delay and absolute carrier-envelope phase. Quantitative modelling of the experiments enables us to monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of the electron density and currents induced in the system and to elucidate the physics underlying the electron transfer driven by strong optical fields in plasmonic gaps.

However, understanding the role of nematicity and nematic fluctuations in Cooper pairing is often made more complicated by the coexistence of other orders, particularly long-range magnetic order. Here we report the enhancement of superconductivity in a model electronic nematic system that is not magnetic, and show that the enhancement is directly born out of strong nematic fluctuations associated with a quantum phase transition. We present measurements of the resistance as a function of strain in Ba<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub> to show that strontium substitution promotes an electronically driven nematic order in this system. In addition, the complete suppression of that order to absolute zero temperature leads to an enhancement of the pairing strength, as evidenced by a sixfold increase in the superconducting transition temperature.

This includes scenarios in which interacting entities are required to be non-identical in order to exhibit identical behaviour, such as in reaching consensus. Here we present an experimental demonstration of this phenomenon. Using a network of alternating-current electromechanical oscillators, we show that their ability to achieve identical frequency synchronization is enhanced when the oscillators are tuned to be suitably non-identical and that converse symmetry breaking persists for a range of noise levels.

Hodgkin&#8211;Huxley and related conductance-based models of electrophysiology belong to a more general class of reaction&#8211;diffusion equations that could, in principle, support the spontaneous emergence of patterns of membrane voltage that are stable in time but structured in space. Here, we show theoretically and experimentally that homogeneous or nearly homogeneous tissues can undergo spontaneous spatial symmetry breaking through a purely electrophysiological mechanism, leading to the formation of domains with different resting potentials separated by stable bioelectrical domain walls. Transitions from one resting potential to another can occur through long-range migration of these domain walls. We map bioelectrical domain wall motion using all-optical electrophysiology in an engineered cell line and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived myoblasts.
