letter,Measurement of the mass difference and the binding energy of the hypertriton and antihypertriton,"<p>According to the CPT theorem, which states that the combined operation of charge conjugation, parity transformation and time reversal must be conserved, particles and their antiparticles should have the same mass and lifetime but opposite charge and magnetic moment. Here, we test CPT symmetry in a nucleus containing a strange quark, more specifically in the hypertriton. This hypernucleus is the lightest one yet discovered and consists of a proton, a neutron and a &#923; hyperon. With data recorded by the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, we measure the &#923; hyperon binding energy B<sub>&#923;</sub> for the hypertriton, and find that it differs from the widely used value and from predictions, where the hypertriton is treated as a weakly bound system. Our results place stringent constraints on the hyperon&#8211;nucleon interaction and have implications for understanding neutron star interiors, where strange matter may be present. A precise comparison of the masses of the hypertriton and the antihypertriton allows us to test CPT symmetry in a nucleus with strangeness, and we observe no deviation from the expected exact symmetry.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

letter,Buffer gas cooling of a trapped ion to the quantum regime,"<p>Great advances in precision measurements in the quantum regime have been achieved with trapped ions and atomic gases at the lowest possible temperatures. These successes have inspired ideas to merge the two systems. In this way, we can study the unique properties of ionic impurities inside a quantum fluid or explore buffer gas cooling of a trapped-ion quantum computer. Remarkably, in spite of its importance, experiments with atom&#8211;ion mixtures have remained firmly confined to the classical collision regime. We report a collision energy of 1.15(&#177;0.23) times the s-wave energy (or 9.9(&#177;2.0)&#8201;&#956;K) for a trapped ytterbium ion in an ultracold lithium gas. We observed a deviation from classical Langevin theory by studying the spin-exchange dynamics, indicating quantum effects in the atom&#8211;ion collisions.

letter,Strong optical coupling through superfluid Brillouin lasing,"<p>Brillouin scattering has applications ranging from signal processing, sensing and microscopy to quantum information and fundamental science. Most of these applications rely on the electrostrictive interaction between light and phonons. Here we show that in liquids optically induced surface deformations can provide an alternative and far stronger interaction. This allows the demonstration of ultralow-threshold Brillouin lasing and strong phonon-mediated optical coupling. This form of strong coupling is a key capability for Brillouin-reconfigurable optical switches and circuits, for photonic quantum interfaces and to generate synthetic electromagnetic fields. While applicable to liquids quite generally, our demonstration uses superfluid helium. Configured as a Brillouin gyroscope this provides the prospect of measuring superfluid circulation with unprecedented precision, and exploring the rich physics of quantum fluid dynamics, from quantized vorticity to quantum turbulence.</p>",[],False,"[""Xin He"", ""Glen I.

letter,Elastic ripening and inhibition of liquid–liquid phase separation,"<p>Phase separation is a central concept of materials physics and has recently emerged as an important route to compartmentalization within living cells. Biological phase separation features activity, complex compositions and elasticity, which reveal important gaps in our understanding of this universal physical phenomenon. Here, we explore the impact of elasticity on phase separation in synthetic polymer networks. We show that compressive stresses in a polymer network can suppress phase separation of the solvent that swells it, stabilizing mixtures well beyond the liquid&#8211;liquid phase-separation boundary. Network stresses also drive a new form of ripening, driven by transport of solute down stiffness gradients. This elastic ripening can be much faster than conventional Ostwald ripening driven by surface tension.</p>",[],False,"[""Kathryn A.

Contrarily, biological agents such as Ebola or measles are typically thought to spread as simple contagions. Here, we demonstrate that these different spreading mechanisms can have indistinguishable population-level dynamics once multiple contagions interact. In the social context, our results highlight the challenge of identifying and quantifying spreading mechanisms, such as social reinforcement, in a world where an innumerable number of ideas, memes and behaviours interact. In the biological context, this parallel allows the use of complex contagions to effectively quantify the non-trivial interactions of infectious diseases.</p>",[],True,"[""Laurent H\u00e9bert-Dufresne"", ""Samuel V.

article,Plasma stopping-power measurements reveal transition from non-degenerate to degenerate plasmas,"<p>Physically realized electron gas systems usually reside in either the quantum non-degenerate or fully degenerate limit, where the average de Broglie wavelength of the thermal electrons becomes comparable with the interparticle distance between electrons. A few systems, such as young brown dwarfs and the cold dense fuels created in imploded cryogenic capsules at the National Ignition Facility, lie between these two limits and are partially degenerate. The National Ignition Facility has the unique capability of varying the electron quantum degeneracy by adjusting the laser drive used to implode the capsules. This allows experimental studies of the effects of the degeneracy level on plasma transport properties. By measuring rare nuclear reactions in these cold dense fuels, we show that the electron stopping power, which is the rate of energy loss per unit distance travelled by a charged particle, changes with increasing electron density. We observe a quantum-induced shift in the peak of the stopping power using diagnostics that measure above and below this peak. The observed changes in the stopping power are shown to be unique to the transition region between non-degenerate and degenerate plasmas. Our results support the screening models applied to partially degenerate astrophysical systems such as young brown dwarfs.</p>",[],False,"[""A. C. Hayes"", ""M. E. Gooden"", ""E.

article,Classical discrete time crystals,"<p>The spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry in periodically driven quantum systems leads to a new phase of matter: the discrete time crystal (DTC). This phase exhibits collective subharmonic oscillations that depend upon an interplay of non-equilibrium driving, many-body interactions and the breakdown of ergodicity. However, subharmonic responses are also a well-known feature of classical dynamical systems ranging from predator&#8211;prey models to Faraday waves and a.c.-driven charge density waves. This raises the question of whether these classical phenomena display the same rigidity characteristic of a quantum DTC. In this work, we explore this question in the context of periodically driven Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a finite-temperature bath, which provides both friction and, crucially, noise. Focusing on one-dimensional chains, where in equilibrium any transition would be forbidden at finite temperature, we provide evidence that the combination of noise and interactions drives a sharp, first-order dynamical phase transition between a discrete time-translation invariant phase and an activated classical discrete time crystal (CDTC) in which time-translation symmetry is broken out to exponentially long timescales. Power-law correlations are present along a first-order line, which terminates at a critical point. We analyse the transition by mapping it to the locked-to-sliding transition of a d.c.-driven charge density wave. Finally, building upon results from the field of probabilistic cellular automata, we conjecture the existence of classical time crystals with true long-range order, where time-translation symmetry is broken out to infinite times.</p>",[],False,"[""Norman Y.

Recent approaches propose inferring predictors from a variety of human-defined features using machine learning. Here we determine the long-time evolution of a glassy system solely from the initial particle positions and without any handcrafted features, using graph neural networks as a powerful model. We show that this method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, generalizing over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and densities. In shear experiments, it predicts the locations of rearranging particles. The structural predictors learned by our network exhibit a correlation length that increases with larger timescales to reach the size of our system.

article,Universal gap scaling in percolation,"<p>Universality is a principle that fundamentally underlies many critical phenomena, ranging from epidemic spreading to the emergence or breakdown of global connectivity in networks. Percolation, the transition to global connectedness on gradual addition of links, may exhibit substantial gaps in the size of the largest connected network component. We uncover that the largest gap statistics is governed by extreme-value theory. This allows us to unify continuous and discontinuous percolation by virtue of universal critical scaling functions, obtained from normal and extreme-value statistics. Specifically, we show that the universal scaling function of the size of the largest gap is given by the extreme-value Gumbel distribution. This links extreme-value statistics to universality and criticality in percolation.</p>",[],False,"[""Jingfang Fan"", ""Jun Meng"", ""Yang Liu"", ""Abbas Ali Saberi"", ""J\u00fcrgen Kurths"", ""Jan Nagler""]","Fan, J., Meng, J., Liu, Y. et al.

Plasmons, the collective oscillations of free electrons coupled to photons, shrink the wavelength of light to electronic and molecular length scales. We propose a novel approach to EPs based on spatial symmetry breaking and report their observation in plasmonics at room temperature. The plasmonic EPs are based on the hybridization of detuned resonances in multilayered plasmonic structures to reach a critical complex coupling rate between nanoantenna arrays, resulting in the simultaneous coalescence of the resonances and loss rates.

article,Gapless ground state in the archetypal quantum kagome antiferromagnet ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2,"<p>Spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter that challenge Landau&#8217;s paradigm of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. Despite strong exchange interactions, spins do not order or freeze down to zero temperature. Although well established for one-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets, in higher dimensions where quantum fluctuations are less acute, realizing and understanding such states is a major issue, both theoretically and experimentally. In this regard, the simplest nearest-neighbour Heisenberg antiferromagnet Hamiltonian on the highly frustrated kagome lattice has proven to be a fascinating and inspiring model. The exact nature of its ground state remains elusive and the existence of a spin-gap is the first key issue to be addressed to discriminate between the various classes of proposed spin liquids. Here, through low-temperature NMR contrast experiments on high-quality single crystals, we single out the kagome susceptibility and the corresponding dynamics in the kagome archetype, the mineral herbertsmithite, ZnCu<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. We firmly conclude that this material does not harbour any spin-gap, which restores a convergence with recent numerical results promoting a gapless Dirac spin liquid as the ground state of the Heisenberg kagome antiferromagnet.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

article,Odd elasticity,"<p>A passive solid cannot do work on its surroundings through any quasistatic cycle of deformations. This property places strong constraints on the allowed elastic moduli. In this Article, we show that static elastic moduli altogether absent in passive elasticity can arise from active, non-conservative microscopic interactions. These active moduli enter the antisymmetric (or odd) part of the static elastic modulus tensor and quantify the amount of work extracted along quasistatic strain cycles. In two-dimensional isotropic media, two chiral odd-elastic moduli emerge in addition to the bulk and shear moduli. We discuss microscopic realizations that include networks of Hookean springs augmented with active transverse forces and non-reciprocal active hinges. Using coarse-grained microscopic models, numerical simulations and continuum equations, we uncover phenomena ranging from auxetic behaviour induced by odd moduli to elastic wave propagation in overdamped media enabled by self-sustained active strain cycles.

article,Polar jets of swimming bacteria condensed by a patterned liquid crystal,"<p>Active matter exhibits remarkable collective behaviour in which flows, continuously generated by active particles, are intertwined with the orientational order of these particles. The relationship remains poorly understood as the activity and order are difficult to control independently. Here we demonstrate important facets of this interplay by exploring the dynamics of swimming bacteria in a liquid crystalline environment with predesigned periodic splay and bend in molecular orientation. The bacteria are expelled from the bend regions and condense into polar jets that propagate and transport cargo unidirectionally along the splay regions. The bacterial jets remain stable even when the local concentration exceeds the threshold of bending instability in a non-patterned system. Collective polar propulsion and the different roles of bend and splay are explained by an advection&#8211;diffusion model and by numerical simulations that treat the system as a two-phase active nematic. The ability of prepatterned liquid crystalline medium to streamline the chaotic movements of swimming bacteria into polar jets that can carry cargo along a predesigned trajectory opens the door for potential applications in microscale delivery and soft microrobotics.</p>",[],False,"[""Taras Turiv"", ""Runa Koizumi"", ""Kristian Thijssen"", ""Mikhail M.

Focusing on small- to intermediate-sized groups (10&#8201;&#8818;&#8201;N&#8201;&#8818;&#8201;100), we demonstrate that schooling (highly polarized and coherent motion) is noise induced, arising from the intrinsic stochasticity associated with finite numbers of interacting fish. The fewer the fish, the greater the (multiplicative) noise and therefore the greater the likelihood of alignment. Such rare empirical evidence tightly constrains the possible underlying interactions that govern fish alignment, suggesting that E. suratensis either spontaneously change their direction or copy the direction of another fish, without any local averaging (the otherwise canonical mechanism of collective alignment). Our study therefore highlights the importance of stochasticity in behavioural inference. Furthermore, rather than simply obscuring otherwise deterministic dynamics, noise can be fundamental to the characterization of emergent collective behaviours.</p>",[],False,"[""Jitesh Jhawar"", ""Richard G.
