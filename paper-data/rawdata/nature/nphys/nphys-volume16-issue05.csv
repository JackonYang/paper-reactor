letter,Exponential suppression of bit-flips in a qubit encoded in an oscillator,"<p>A quantum system interacts with its environment&#8212;if ever so slightly&#8212;no matter how much care is put into isolating it. Therefore, quantum bits undergo errors, putting dauntingly difficult constraints on the hardware suitable for quantum computation. New strategies are emerging to circumvent this problem by encoding a quantum bit non-locally across the phase space of a physical system. Because most sources of decoherence result from local fluctuations, the foundational promise is to exponentially suppress errors by increasing a measure of this non-locality. Prominent examples are topological quantum bits, which delocalize information over real space and where spatial extent measures non-locality. Here, we encode a quantum bit in the field quadrature space of a superconducting resonator endowed with a special mechanism that dissipates photons in pairs. This process pins down two computational states to separate locations in phase space. By increasing this separation, we measure an exponential decrease of the bit-flip rate while only linearly increasing the phase-flip rate. Because bit-flips are autonomously corrected, only phase-flips remain to be corrected via a one-dimensional quantum error correction code. This exponential scaling demonstrates that resonators with nonlinear dissipation are promising building blocks for quantum computation with drastically reduced hardware overhead.</p>",[],False,"[""Rapha\u00ebl Lescanne"", ""Marius Villiers"", ""Th\u00e9au Peronnin"", ""Alain Sarlette"", ""Matthieu Delbecq"", ""Benjamin Huard"", ""Takis Kontos"", ""Mazyar Mirrahimi"", ""Zaki Leghtas""]","Lescanne, R., Villiers, M., Peronnin, T. et al.

letter,Nematic transitions in iron pnictide superconductors imaged with a quantum gas,"<p>The Scanning Quantum Cryogenic Atom Microscope (SQCRAMscope) uses an atomic Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate to measure magnetic fields emanating from solid-state samples. The quantum sensor does so with unprecedented d.c. sensitivity at micrometre resolution, from room to cryogenic temperatures. An additional advantage of the SQCRAMscope is the preservation of optical access to the sample so that magnetometry imaging of, for example, electron transport may be performed in concert with other imaging techniques. Here, we apply this multimodal imaging capability to the study of nematicity in iron pnictide high-temperature superconductors, where the relationship between electronic and structural symmetry breaking resulting in a nematic phase is under debate. We combine the SQCRAMscope with an in situ microscope that measures optical birefringence near the surface. This enables simultaneous and spatially resolved detection of both bulk and near-surface manifestations of nematicity via transport and structural deformation channels, respectively. By performing local measurements of emergent resistivity anisotropy in iron pnictides, we observe sharp, nearly concurrent transport and structural transitions. More broadly, these measurements demonstrate the SQCRAMscope&#8217;s ability to reveal important insights into the physics of complex quantum materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Fan Yang"", ""Stephen F.

letter,Correlated states in twisted double bilayer graphene,"<p>Electron&#8211;electron interactions play an important role in graphene and related systems and can induce exotic quantum states, especially in a stacked bilayer with a small twist angle. For bilayer graphene where the two layers are twisted by the &#8216;magic angle&#8217;, flat band and strong many-body effects lead to correlated insulating states and superconductivity. In contrast to monolayer graphene, the band structure of untwisted bilayer graphene can be further tuned by a displacement field, providing an extra degree of freedom to control the flat band that should appear when two bilayers are stacked on top of each other. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of displacement field-tunable electronic phases in twisted double bilayer graphene. We observe insulating states at a half-filled conduction band in an intermediate range of displacement fields. Furthermore, the resistance gap in the correlated insulator increases with respect to the in-plane magnetic fields and we find that the g factor, according to the spin Zeeman effect, is ~2, indicating spin polarization at half-filling. These results establish twisted double bilayer graphene as an easily tunable platform for exploring quantum many-body states.</p>",[],False,"[""Cheng Shen"", ""Yanbang Chu"", ""QuanSheng Wu"", ""Na Li"", ""Shuopei Wang"", ""Yanchong Zhao"", ""Jian Tang"", ""Jieying Liu"", ""Jinpeng Tian"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Rong Yang"", ""Zi Yang Meng"", ""Dongxia Shi"", ""Oleg V.

letter,Proximity-induced superconducting gap in the quantum spin Hall edge state of monolayer WTe2,"<p>The quantum spin Hall insulator is characterized by a bandgap in the two-dimensional (2D) interior and helical 1D edge states. Inducing superconductivity in the helical edge state results in a 1D topological superconductor, a highly sought-after state of matter at the core of many proposals for topological quantum computing. In the present study, we report the coexistence of superconductivity and the quantum spin Hall edge state in a van der Waals heterostructure, by placing a monolayer of 1T&#8242;-WTe<sub>2</sub>, a quantum spin Hall insulator, on a van der Waals superconductor, NbSe<sub>2</sub>. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we demonstrate that the WTe<sub>2</sub> monolayer exhibits a proximity-induced superconducting gap due to the underlying superconductor and that the spectroscopic features of the quantum spin Hall edge state remain intact.

letter,Broken time-reversal symmetry in the topological superconductor UPt3,"<p>Topological properties of materials are of fundamental as well as practical importance. Of particular interest are unconventional superconductors that break time-reversal symmetry, for which the superconducting state is protected topologically and vortices can host Majorana fermions with potential use in quantum computing. However, in striking contrast to the unconventional A phase of superfluid <sup>3</sup>He where chiral symmetry was directly observed, identification of broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, a key component of chiral symmetry, has presented a challenge in bulk materials. The two leading candidates for bulk chiral superconductors are UPt<sub>3</sub> (refs.&#8201;) and Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> (ref.&#8201;), although evidence for broken time-reversal symmetry comes largely from surface-sensitive measurements. A long-sought demonstration of broken time-reversal symmetry in bulk Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> is the observation of edge currents, which has so far not been successful. The situation for UPt<sub>3</sub> is not much better. Here, we use vortices to probe the superconducting state in ultraclean crystals of UPt<sub>3</sub>. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a strictly bulk probe, we demonstrate that the vortices possess an internal degree of freedom in one of its three superconducting phases, providing direct evidence for bulk broken time-reversal symmetry in this material.</p>",[],False,"[""K.

letter,"Atomic line defects and zero-energy end states in monolayer Fe(Te,Se) high-temperature superconductors","<p>Majorana zero-energy bound states have been proposed to exist at the ends of one-dimensional Rashba nanowires proximity-coupled to an s-wave superconductor in an external magnetic field. Such hybrid structures are a central platform in the search for non-Abelian Majorana zero modes that may be applied in fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Here we report the discovery of zero-energy bound states simultaneously appearing at both ends of a one-dimensional atomic line defect in monolayer iron-based high-temperature superconductor FeTe<sub>0.5</sub>Se<sub>0.5</sub> films. The spectroscopic properties of the zero-energy bound states, including the temperature and tunnelling barrier dependences, as well as their fusion induced by coupling on line defects of different lengths are found to be robust and consistent with those of the Majorana zero modes. These observations suggest a realization of topological Shockley defects at the ends of an atomic line defect in a two-dimensional s-wave superconductor that can host a Kramers pair of Majorana zero modes protected by time-reversal symmetry along the chain. Our findings reveal a class of topological line defect excitations in two-dimensional superconductor FeTe<sub>0.5</sub>Se<sub>0.5</sub> monolayer films and offer an advantageous platform for generating topological zero-energy excitations at higher operating temperatures, in a single material, and under zero external magnetic field.</p>",[],False,"[""Cheng Chen"", ""Kun Jiang"", ""Yi Zhang"", ""Chaofei Liu"", ""Yi Liu"", ""Ziqiang Wang"", ""Jian Wang""]","Chen, C., Jiang, K., Zhang, Y. et al.

letter,Discovery of the soft electronic modes of the trimeron order in magnetite,"<p>The Verwey transition in magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is the first metal&#8211;insulator transition ever observed and involves a concomitant structural rearrangement and charge&#8211;orbital ordering. Owing to the complex interplay of these intertwined degrees of freedom, a complete characterization of the low-temperature phase of magnetite and the mechanism driving the transition have long remained elusive. It was demonstrated in recent years that the fundamental building blocks of the charge-ordered structure are three-site small polarons called trimerons. However, electronic collective modes of this trimeron order have not been detected to date, and thus an understanding of the dynamics of the Verwey transition from an electronic point of view is still lacking. Here, we discover spectroscopic signatures of the low-energy electronic excitations of the trimeron network using terahertz light. By driving these modes coherently with an ultrashort laser pulse, we reveal their critical softening and hence demonstrate their direct involvement in the Verwey transition. These findings shed new light on the cooperative mechanism at the origin of magnetite&#8217;s exotic ground state.</p>",[],False,"[""Edoardo Baldini"", ""Carina A.

letter,A quantum liquid of magnetic octupoles on the pyrochlore lattice,"<p>Spin liquids are highly correlated yet disordered states formed by the entanglement of magnetic dipoles. Theories define such states using gauge fields and deconfined quasiparticle excitations that emerge from a local constraint governing the ground state of a frustrated magnet. For example, the &#8216;2-in&#8211;2-out&#8217; ice rule for dipole moments on a tetrahedron can lead to a quantum spin ice in rare-earth pyrochlores. However, f-electron ions often carry multipole degrees of freedom of higher rank than dipoles, leading to intriguing behaviours and &#8216;hidden&#8217; orders. Here we show that the correlated ground state of a Ce<sup>3+</sup>-based pyrochlore, Ce<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, is a quantum liquid of magnetic octupoles. Our neutron scattering results are consistent with a fluid-like state where degrees of freedom have a more complex magnetization density than that of magnetic dipoles. The nature and strength of the octupole&#8211;octupole couplings, together with the existence of a continuum of excitations attributed to spinons, provides further evidence for a quantum ice of octupoles governed by a &#8216;2-plus&#8211;2-minus&#8217; rule. Our work identifies Ce<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> as a unique example of frustrated multipoles forming a &#8216;hidden&#8217; topological order, thus generalizing observations on quantum spin liquids to multipolar phases that can support novel types of emergent fields and excitations.</p>",[],False,"[""Romain Sibille"", ""Nicolas Gauthier"", ""Elsa Lhotel"", ""Victor Por\u00e9e"", ""Vladimir Pomjakushin"", ""Russell A.

Most tissues, animal brains in particular, comprise a mix of many cell types, with mounting evidence suggesting that neurons can recognize their respective types as they organize in space. How cell diversity revises the current jamming paradigm is unknown. Here, in the brain of the flatworm planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, which exhibits remarkable tissue plasticity within a simple, quantifiable nervous system, we identify a distinct packing state, &#8216;chromatic&#8217; jamming. Combining experiments with computational modelling, we show that neurons of distinct types form independent percolating networks barring any physical contact.

article,Mechanisms of spatiotemporal mode-locking,"<p>Mode-locking is a process in which different modes of an optical resonator establish stable synchronization through non-linear interactions. This self-organization underlies light sources that enable many modern scientific applications, such as ultrafast and high-field optics and frequency combs. Despite this, mode-locking has almost exclusively referred to the self-organization of light in a single dimension&#8212;time. Here we present a theoretical approach&#8212;attractor dissection&#8212;to understand three-dimensional spatiotemporal mode-locking. The key idea is to find a specific, minimal reduced model for each distinct type of three-dimensional pulse, and thus identify the important intracavity effects responsible for its formation and stability. An intuition for the results follows from the minimum loss principle, the idea that a laser strives to find the configuration of intracavity light that minimizes loss (maximizes gain extraction). Through this approach, we identify and explain several distinct forms of spatiotemporal mode-locking. These phases of coherent laser light have no analogues in one dimension and are supported by measurements of the three-dimensional field, which reveals spatiotemporal mode-locked states that comprise more than 10<sup>7</sup> cavity modes. Our results should facilitate the discovery and understanding of new higher-dimensional forms of coherent light which, in turn, may enable new applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Logan G.

article,Revealing the missing dimension at an exceptional point,"<p>The radiation of electromagnetic and mechanical waves depends not only on the intrinsic properties of the emitter but also on the surrounding environment. This principle has laid the foundation for the development of lasers, quantum optics, sonar, musical instruments and other fields related to wave&#8211;matter interaction. In the conventional wisdom, the environment is defined exclusively by its eigenstates, and an emitter radiates into and interacts with these eigenstates. Here we show experimentally that this scenario breaks down at a non-Hermitian degeneracy known as an exceptional point. We find a chirality-reversal phenomenon in a ring cavity where the radiation field reveals the missing dimension of the Hilbert space, known as the Jordan vector. This phenomenon demonstrates that the radiation field of an emitter can become fully decoupled from the eigenstates of its environment. The generality of this striking phenomenon in wave&#8211;matter interaction is experimentally confirmed in both electromagnetic and acoustic systems. Our finding transforms the fundamental understanding of light&#8211;matter interaction and wave&#8211;matter interaction in general, and enriches the intriguing physics of exceptional points.</p>",[],False,"[""Hua-Zhou Chen"", ""Tuo Liu"", ""Hong-Yi Luan"", ""Rong-Juan Liu"", ""Xing-Yuan Wang"", ""Xue-Feng Zhu"", ""Yuan-Bo Li"", ""Zhong-Ming Gu"", ""Shan-Jun Liang"", ""He Gao"", ""Ling Lu"", ""Li Ge"", ""Shuang Zhang"", ""Jie Zhu"", ""Ren-Min Ma""]","Chen, HZ., Liu, T., Luan, HY. et al.

article,On the Planckian bound for heat diffusion in insulators,"<p>In an insulator, thermal transport at high temperature is expected to be dominated by entirely classical phonon dynamics. In apparent tension with this expectation, recent experimental observations have led to the conjecture that the transport lifetime, &#964;, is subject to a Planckian bound from below, namely, &#964; &#8819; &#964;<sub>Pl</sub> &#8801; &#8463; &#8725; (k<sub>B</sub>T). Here, we argue that this Planckian bound is due to a quantum-mechanical bound on the sound velocity: v<sub>s</sub> &lt; v<sub>M</sub>. The &#8216;melting velocity&#8217; v<sub>M</sub> is defined in terms of the melting temperature of the crystal, the interatomic spacing and Planck&#8217;s constant. We show that for several classes of insulating crystals, both simple and complex, &#964; &#8725; &#964;<sub>Pl</sub> &#8776; v<sub>M</sub> &#8725; v<sub>s</sub> at high temperatures. The velocity bound therefore implies the Planckian bound.</p>",[],False,"[""Connie H. Mousatov"", ""Sean A. Hartnoll""]","Mousatov, C.H., Hartnoll, S.A.

article,Deformation and bursting of elastic capsules impacting a rigid wall,"<p>From water balloons to cells and various organs, thin elastic shells enclosing liquid cores or capsules are ubiquitous. Although such capsules are rampant in nature and in engineering, the physics of their deformation upon rapid impact is virtually unexplored. Here we perform experiments and develop formal models to rationalize the deformation and possible bursting of elastic capsules impacting rigid walls. We discover an analogy to the impact of liquid drops, where the shell surface modulus plays the role of the drop surface tension. On the basis of this analogy, we propose an energy balance that quantitatively predicts the maximal deformation of the capsule in the inviscid limit, and for liquids with viscosities up to 1,000&#8201;cP (Reynolds numbers &#8819;10). Unlike drops, however, capsules can be pre-stretched and burst. Experiments show a substantial influence of the pre-stretch on the critical burst velocity, a feature also captured by our model. While we focus on macroscopic objects, our model could potentially be extended to account for the deformations of microcapsules in microfluidic channels. In addition, this work could have practical implications from the optimized detonation of fire-extinguishing balls to fight domestic fires and wildfires to the prevention of organ bursting in car crashes.</p>",[],False,"[""Etienne Jambon-Puillet"", ""Trevor J.

article,Phase transitions in information spreading on structured populations,"<p>Mathematical models of social contagion that incorporate networks of human interactions have become increasingly popular, however, very few approaches have tackled the challenges of including complex and realistic properties of socio-technical systems. Here, we define a framework to characterize the dynamics of the Maki&#8211;Thompson rumour spreading model in structured populations, and analytically find a previously uncharacterized dynamical phase transition that separates the local and global contagion regimes. We validate our threshold prediction through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we apply this framework in two real-world systems, the European commuting and transportation network and the Digital Bibliography and Library Project collaboration network. Our findings highlight the importance of the underlying population structure in understanding social contagion phenomena and have the potential to define new intervention strategies aimed at hindering or facilitating the diffusion of information in socio-technical systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Jessica T.
