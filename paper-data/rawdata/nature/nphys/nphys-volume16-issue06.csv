letter,Thermodynamics of hot strong-interaction matter from ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions,"<p>Collisions between heavy atomic nuclei at ultrarelativistic energies are carried out at particle colliders to produce the quark&#8211;gluon plasma, a state of matter where quarks and gluons are not confined into hadrons, and colour degrees of freedom are liberated. This state is thought to be produced as a transient phenomenon before it fragments into thousands of particles that reach the particle detectors. Despite two decades of investigations, one of the big open challenges is to obtain an experimental determination of the temperature reached in a heavy-ion collision, and a simultaneous determination of another thermodynamic quantity, such as the entropy density, that would give access to the number of degrees of freedom. Here, we obtain such a determination, utilizing state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations. We define an effective temperature, averaged over the spacetime evolution of the medium. Then, using experimental data, we determine this temperature and the corresponding entropy density and speed of sound in the matter created in lead&#8211;lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Our results agree with first-principles calculations from lattice quantum chromodynamics and confirm that a deconfined phase of matter is indeed produced.</p>",[],False,"[""Fernando G.

letter,Measurement and microscopic description of odd–even staggering of charge radii of exotic copper isotopes,"<p>Nuclear charge radii globally scale with atomic mass number A as A<sup>1&#8725;3</sup>, and isotopes with an odd number of neutrons are usually slightly smaller in size than their even-neutron neighbours. This odd&#8211;even staggering, ubiquitous throughout the nuclear landscape, varies with the number of protons and neutrons, and poses a substantial challenge for nuclear theory. Here, we report measurements of the charge radii of short-lived copper isotopes up to the very exotic <sup>78</sup>Cu (with proton number Z = 29 and neutron number N = 49), produced at only 20 ions s<sup>&#8211;1</sup>, using the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy method at the Isotope Mass Separator On-Line Device facility (ISOLDE) at CERN. We observe an unexpected reduction in the odd&#8211;even staggering for isotopes approaching the N = 50 shell gap. To describe the data, we applied models based on nuclear density functional theory and A-body valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group theory. Through these comparisons, we demonstrate a relation between the global behaviour of charge radii and the saturation density of nuclear matter, and show that the local charge radii variations, which reflect the many-body polarization effects, naturally emerge from A-body calculations fitted to properties of A &#8804; 4 nuclei.</p>",[],True,"[""R.

letter,Electronic correlations in nodal-line semimetals,"<p>Dirac fermions with highly dispersive linear bands are usually considered weakly correlated due to the relatively large bandwidths (W) compared to Coulomb interactions (U). With the discovery of nodal-line semimetals, the notion of the Dirac point has been extended to lines and loops in momentum space. The anisotropy associated with nodal-line structure gives rise to greatly reduced kinetic energy along the line. However, experimental evidence for the anticipated enhanced correlations in nodal-line semimetals is sparse. Here, we report on prominent correlation effects in a nodal-line semimetal compound, ZrSiSe, through a combination of optical spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. We observed two fundamental spectroscopic hallmarks of electronic correlations: strong reduction (1/3) of the free-carrier Drude weight and also the Fermi velocity compared to predictions of density functional band theory. The renormalization of Fermi velocity can be further controlled with an external magnetic field. ZrSiSe therefore offers the rare opportunity to investigate correlation-driven physics in a Dirac system.</p>",[],False,"[""Yinming Shao"", ""A. N.

letter,Strong photon coupling to the quadrupole moment of an electron in a solid-state qubit,"<p>The fundamental concept of light&#8211;matter interaction is routinely realized by coupling the quantized electric field in a cavity to the dipole moment of a real or an artificial atom. A recent proposal, motivated by the prospect of overcoming the decohering effects of distant charge fluctuations, suggests that introduction of and coupling to an electric quadrupole moment of a single electron can be achieved by confining it in a triple quantum dot. Here, we show an experimental realization of this concept by connecting a superconducting microwave resonator to the middle of the three dots, such that the dipole coupling becomes negligible. We demonstrate strong coupling to the electron quadrupole moment and determine that the coherence of our system is limited by short-range charge noise.

letter,A quantum network node with crossed optical fibre cavities,"<p>Quantum networks provide unique possibilities for resolving open questions on entanglement and promise innovative applications ranging from secure communication to scalable computation. Although two quantum nodes coupled by a single channel are adequate for basic quantum communication tasks between two parties, fully functional large-scale quantum networks require a web-like architecture with multiply connected nodes. Efficient interfaces between network nodes and channels can be implemented with optical cavities. Using two optical fibre cavities coupled to one atom, we here realize a quantum network node that connects to two quantum channels, one provided by each cavity. It functions as a passive, heralded and high-fidelity quantum memory that requires neither amplitude- and phase-critical control fields nor error-prone feedback loops. Our node is robust, fits naturally into larger fibre-based networks and has prospects for extensions including qubit-controlled quantum switches, routers and repeaters.</p>",[],False,"[""Manuel Brekenfeld"", ""Dominik Niemietz"", ""Joseph Dale Christesen"", ""Gerhard Rempe""]","Brekenfeld, M., Niemietz, D., Christesen, J.D. et al.A quantum network node with crossed optical fibre cavities.

How patterns emerge in a homogeneous system is a fundamental question across interdisciplinary research including hydrodynamics, condensed matter physics, nonlinear optics, cosmology and bio-chemistry. Paradigmatic examples, such as Rayleigh&#8211;B&#233;nard convection rolls and Faraday waves, have been studied extensively and found numerous applications. How such knowledge applies to quantum systems and whether the patterns in a quantum system can be controlled remain intriguing questions. Here we show that the density patterns with two- (D<sub>2</sub>), four- (D<sub>4</sub>) and six-fold (D<sub>6</sub>) symmetries can emerge in Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates on demand when the atomic interactions are modulated at multiple frequencies.

letter,Topological turbulence in the membrane of a living cell,"<p>Topological defects determine the structure and function of physical and biological matter over a wide range of scales, from the turbulent vortices in planetary atmospheres, oceans or quantum fluids to bioelectrical signalling in the heart and brain, and cell death. Many advances have been made in understanding and controlling the defect dynamics in active and passive non-equilibrium fluids. Yet, it remains unknown whether the statistical laws that govern the dynamics of defects in classical or quantum fluids extend to the active matter and information flows in living systems. Here, we show that a defect-mediated turbulence underlies the complex wave propagation patterns of Rho-GTP signalling protein on the membrane of starfish egg cells, a process relevant to cytoskeletal remodelling and cell proliferation. Our experiments reveal that the phase velocity field extracted from Rho-GTP concentration waves exhibits vortical defect motions and annihilation dynamics reminiscent of those seen in quantum systems, bacterial turbulence and active nematics. Several key statistics and scaling laws of the defect dynamics can be captured by a minimal Helmholtz&#8211;Onsager point vortex model as well as a generic complex Ginzburg&#8211;Landau continuum theory, suggesting a close correspondence between the biochemical signal propagation on the surface of a living cell and a widely studied class of two-dimensional turbulence and wave phenomena.</p>",[],False,"[""Tzer Han Tan"", ""Jinghui Liu"", ""Pearson W.

Networks of such structures can produce topologically protected qubits where the fundamental energy scale is given by the inter-pair coupling E<sub>M</sub> between the zero modes belonging to different wire segments. Here we report on the spectroscopic measurement of E<sub>M</sub> in an InAs/Al double-island device by tracking the position of the microwave-induced quasiparticle excitations using a radiofrequency charge sensor. At zero magnetic field, photon-assisted tunnelling of Cooper pairs allows us to estimate the Josephson coupling between the islands. In the presence of a magnetic field aligned along the nanowire, we observe the 1e periodic excitation spectrum resulting from a zero-energy subgap state that emerges in a magnetic field. The discrete 1e periodic excitation spectrum is consistent with the coherent hybridization of single-electron states belonging to two opposite-parity branches.

Here, we show how a subtle competition of energetic and entropic free-energy components governs its thermodynamics and the sequence of phase transitions it undergoes upon cooling. By means of comprehensive neutron and X-ray scattering measurements, and supported by first-principles electronic structure simulations, we identify the critical role of the coupling between antiferromagnetic ordering and instabilities of anharmonic phonons in the metallic phase in driving the metal&#8211;insulator transition. The antiferromagnetic ordering enables the emergence of two zone-boundary soft phonons, whose coupling to a zone-centre mode drives the lattice distortion opening the electronic bandgap. Simultaneously, spin&#8211;lattice coupling opens a gap in the magnon spectrum that controls the entropy component of the metal&#8211;insulator transition free energy.

article,Universal scaling of active nematic turbulence,"<p>A landmark of turbulence is the emergence of universal scaling laws, such as Kolmogorov&#8217;s E(q) ~ q<sup>&#8722;5&#8725;3</sup> scaling of the kinetic energy spectrum of inertial turbulence with the wavevector q. In recent years, active fluids have been shown to exhibit turbulent-like flows at low Reynolds number. However, the existence of universal scaling properties in these flows has remained unclear. To address this issue, here we propose a minimal defect-free hydrodynamic theory for two-dimensional active nematic fluids at vanishing Reynolds number. By means of large-scale simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a universal scaling E(q) ~ q<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at long wavelengths. We find that the energy injection due to activity has a peak at a characteristic length scale, which is selected by a nonlinear mechanism. In contrast to inertial turbulence, energy is entirely dissipated at the scale where it is injected, thus precluding energy cascades. Nevertheless, the non-local character of the Stokes flow establishes long-range velocity correlations, which lead to the scaling behaviour.

article,Flexible filaments buckle into helicoidal shapes in strong compressional flows,"<p>The occurrence of coiled or helical morphologies is common in nature, from plant roots to DNA packaging into viral capsids, as well as in applications such as oil drilling processes. In many examples, chiral structures result from the buckling of a straight fibre either with intrinsic twist or to which end moments have been applied in addition to compression forces. Here, we elucidate a generic way to form regular helicoidal shapes from achiral straight filaments transported in viscous flows with free ends. Through a combination of experiments using fluorescently labelled actin filaments in microfluidic divergent flows and two distinct sets of numerical simulations, we demonstrate the robustness of helix formation. A nonlinear stability analysis is performed, and explains the emergence of such chiral structures from the nonlinear interaction of perpendicular planar buckling modes, an effect that solely requires a strong compressional flow, independent of the exact nature of the fibre or type of flow field. The fundamental mechanism for the uncovered morphological transition and characterization of the emerging conformations advance our understanding of several biological and industrial processes and can also be exploited for the controlled microfabrication of chiral objects.</p>",[],False,"[""Brato Chakrabarti"", ""Yanan Liu"", ""John LaGrone"", ""Ricardo Cortez"", ""Lisa Fauci"", ""Olivia du Roure"", ""David Saintillan"", ""Anke Lindner""]","Chakrabarti, B., Liu, Y., LaGrone, J. et al.

article,Remote determination of the shape of Jupiter's vortices from laboratory experiments,"<p>Jupiter&#8217;s dynamics shapes its cloud patterns but remains largely unknown below this natural observational barrier. Unravelling the underlying three-dimensional flows is thus a primary goal for NASA&#8217;s ongoing Juno mission, which was launched in 2011. Here, we address the dynamics of large Jovian vortices using laboratory experiments complemented by theoretical and numerical analyses. We determine the generic force balance responsible for their three-dimensional pancake-like shape. From this, we define scaling laws for their horizontal and vertical aspect ratios as a function of the ambient rotation, stratification and zonal wind velocity. For the Great Red Spot in particular, our predicted horizontal dimensions agree well with measurements at the cloud level since the Voyager mission in 1979. We also predict the Great Red Spot&#8217;s thickness, which is inaccessible to direct observation. It has remained surprisingly constant despite the observed horizontal shrinking. Our results now await comparison with upcoming Juno observations.</p>",[],False,"[""Daphn\u00e9 Lemasquerier"", ""Giulio Facchini"", ""Benjamin Favier"", ""Michael Le Bars""]","Lemasquerier, D., Facchini, G., Favier, B. et al.
