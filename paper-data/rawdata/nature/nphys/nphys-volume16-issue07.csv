review article,Quantum breakdown of superconductivity in low-dimensional materials,"<p>In order to understand the emergence of superconductivity it is useful to study the reverse process and identify the various pathways that lead to its destruction. One way is to increase the amount of disorder, as this leads to an increase in Coulomb repulsion that overpowers the attractive interaction responsible for Cooper pair formation. A second pathway&#8212;applicable to uniformly disordered materials&#8212;is to utilize the competition between superconductivity and Anderson localization, as this leads to electronic granularity in which phase and amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter play a role. Finally, a third pathway is to construct an array of superconducting islands coupled by some form of proximity effect that leads from a superconducting state to a state with finite resistivity, which appears like a metallic groundstate. This Review Article summarizes recent progress in understanding of these different pathways, including experiments in low dimensional materials and application in superconducting quantum devices.</p>",[],False,"[""Benjamin Sac\u00e9p\u00e9"", ""Mikhail Feigel\u2019man"", ""Teunis M.

letter,Generalized bulk–boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian topolectrical circuits,"<p>The study of the laws of nature has traditionally been pursued in the limit of isolated systems, where energy is conserved. This is not always a valid approximation, however, as the inclusion of features such as gain and loss, or periodic driving, qualitatively amends these laws. A contemporary frontier of metamaterial research is the challenge open systems pose to the characterization of topological matter. Here, one of the most relied upon principles is the bulk&#8211;boundary correspondence (BBC), which intimately relates the surface states to the topological classification of the bulk. The presence of gain and loss, in combination with the violation of reciprocity, has been predicted to affect this principle dramatically. Here, we report the experimental observation of BBC violation in a non-reciprocal topolectric circuit, which is also referred to as the non-Hermitian skin effect. The circuit admittance spectrum exhibits an unprecedented sensitivity to the presence of a boundary, displaying an extensive admittance mode localization despite a translationally invariant bulk. Intriguingly, we measure a non-local voltage response due to broken BBC. Depending on the a.c. current feed frequency, the voltage signal accumulates at the left or right boundary, and increases as a function of nodal distance to the current feed.</p>",[],False,"[""T.

letter,Radiative cooling of a spin ensemble,"<p>Physical systems reach thermal equilibrium through energy exchange with their environment, and for spins in solids the relevant environment is almost always their host lattice. However, recent studies motivated by observations by Purcell have shown how radiative emission into a microwave cavity can become the dominant relaxation path for spins if the spin&#8211;cavity coupling is sufficiently large (such as for small-mode-volume cavities). In this regime, the cavity electromagnetic field overrides the lattice as the dominant environment, inviting the prospect of controlling the spin temperature independently from that of the lattice, by engineering a suitable cavity field. Here, we report on precisely such control over spin temperature, illustrating a novel and universal method to increase the electron spin polarization above its thermal equilibrium value (termed hyperpolarization). By switching the cavity input between resistive loads at different temperatures we can control the electron spin polarization, cooling it below the lattice temperature. Our demonstration uses donor spins in silicon coupled to a superconducting microresonator and we observe more than a twofold increase in spin polarization. This approach provides a general route to signal enhancement in electron spin resonance, or nuclear magnetic resonance through dynamical nuclear spin polarization.</p>",[],False,"[""B.

letter,Kinematically complete experimental study of Compton scattering at helium atoms near the threshold,"<p>Compton scattering is one of the fundamental interaction processes of light with matter. When discovered, it was described as a billiard-type collision of a photon &#8216;kicking&#8217; a quasi-free electron. With decreasing photon energy, the maximum possible momentum transfer becomes so small that the corresponding energy falls below the binding energy of the electron. In this regime, ionization by Compton scattering becomes an intriguing quantum phenomenon. Here, we report on a kinematically complete experiment studying Compton scattering off helium atoms in that regime. We determine the momentum correlations of the electron, the recoiling ion and the scattered photon in a coincidence experiment based on cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy, finding that electrons are not only emitted in the direction of the momentum transfer, but that there is a second peak of ejection to the backward direction. This finding links Compton scattering to processes such as ionization by ultrashort optical pulses, electron impact ionization, ion impact ionization and neutron scattering, where similar momentum patterns occur.</p>",[],False,"[""Max Kircher"", ""Florian Trinter"", ""Sven Grundmann"", ""Isabel Vela-Perez"", ""Simon Brennecke"", ""Nicolas Eicke"", ""Jonas Rist"", ""Sebastian Eckart"", ""Salim Houamer"", ""Ochbadrakh Chuluunbaatar"", ""Yuri V.

article,Non-Hermitian bulk–boundary correspondence in quantum dynamics,"<p>Bulk&#8211;boundary correspondence, a guiding principle in topological matter, relates robust edge states to bulk topological invariants. Its validity, however, has so far been established only in closed systems. Recent theoretical studies indicate that this principle requires fundamental revisions for a wide range of open systems with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Therein, the intriguing localization of nominal bulk states at boundaries, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, suggests a non-Bloch band theory in which non-Bloch topological invariants are defined in generalized Brillouin zones, leading to a general bulk&#8211;boundary correspondence beyond the conventional framework. Here, we experimentally observe this fundamental non-Hermitian bulk&#8211;boundary correspondence in discrete-time non-unitary quantum-walk dynamics of single photons. We demonstrate pronounced photon localizations near boundaries even in the absence of topological edge states, thus confirming the non-Hermitian skin effect. Facilitated by our experimental scheme of edge-state reconstruction, we directly measure topological edge states, which are in excellent agreement with the non-Bloch topological invariants. Our work unequivocally establishes the non-Hermitian bulk&#8211;boundary correspondence as a general principle underlying non-Hermitian topological systems and paves the way for a complete understanding of topological matter in open systems.</p>",[],True,"[""Lei Xiao"", ""Tianshu Deng"", ""Kunkun Wang"", ""Gaoyan Zhu"", ""Zhong Wang"", ""Wei Yi"", ""Peng Xue""]","Xiao, L., Deng, T., Wang, K. et al.

article,Non-Hermitian linear response theory,"<p>Linear response theory lies at the heart of studying quantum matters, because it connects the dynamical response of a quantum system to an external probe to correlation functions of the unprobed equilibrium state. Thanks to linear response theory, various experimental probes can be used for determining equilibrium properties. However, so far, both the unprobed system and the probe operator are limited to Hermitian ones. Here, we develop a non-Hermitian linear response theory that considers the dynamical response of a Hermitian system to a non-Hermitian probe, and we can also relate such a dynamical response to the properties of an unprobed Hermitian system at equilibrium. As an application of our theory, we consider the real-time dynamics of momentum distribution induced by one-body and two-body dissipations. Remarkably, for a critical state with no well-defined quasi-particles, we find that the dynamics are slower than the normal state with well-defined quasi-particles, and our theory provides a model-independent way to extract the critical exponent in the real-time correlation function. We find surprisingly good agreement between our theory and a recent cold atom experiment on the dissipative Bose&#8211;Hubbard model. We also propose to further quantitatively verify our theory by performing experiments on dissipative one-dimensional Luttinger liquid.</p>",[],True,"[""Lei Pan"", ""Xin Chen"", ""Yu Chen"", ""Hui Zhai""]","Pan, L., Chen, X., Chen, Y. et al.

article,A quantum memory at telecom wavelengths,"<p>Nanofabricated mechanical resonators are gaining significant momentum among potential quantum technologies due to their unique design freedom and independence from naturally occurring resonances. As their functionality is widely detached from material choice, they constitute ideal tools for transducers&#8212;intermediaries between different quantum systems&#8212;and as memory elements in conjunction with quantum communication and computing devices. Their capability to host ultra-long-lived phonon modes is particularity attractive for non-classical information storage, both for future quantum technologies and for fundamental tests of physics.

article,Probing molecular environment through photoemission delays,"<p>Attosecond chronoscopy has revealed small but measurable delays in photoionization, characterized by the ejection of an electron on absorption of a single photon. Ionization-delay measurements in atomic targets provide a wealth of information about the timing of the photoelectric effect, resonances, electron correlations and transport. However, extending this approach to molecules presents challenges, such as identifying the correct ionization channels and the effect of the anisotropic molecular landscape on the measured delays. Here, we measure ionization delays from ethyl iodide around a giant dipole resonance. By using the theoretical value for the iodine atom as a reference, we disentangle the contribution from the functional ethyl group, which is responsible for the characteristic chemical reactivity of a molecule. We find a substantial additional delay caused by the presence of a functional group, which encodes the effect of the molecular potential on the departing electron. Such information is inaccessible to the conventional approach of measuring photoionization cross-sections. The results establish ionization-delay measurements as a valuable tool in investigating the electronic properties of molecules.</p>",[],False,"[""Shubhadeep Biswas"", ""Benjamin F\u00f6rg"", ""Lisa Ortmann"", ""Johannes Sch\u00f6tz"", ""Wolfgang Schweinberger"", ""Tom\u00e1\u0161 Zimmermann"", ""Liangwen Pi"", ""Denitsa Baykusheva"", ""Hafiz A.

article,The role of single-cell mechanical behaviour and polarity in driving collective cell migration,"<p>The directed migration of cell collectives is essential in various physiological processes, such as epiboly, intestinal epithelial turnover, and convergent extension during morphogenesis, as well as during pathological events such as wound healing and cancer metastasis. Collective cell migration leads to the emergence of coordinated movements over multiple cells. Our current understanding emphasizes that these movements are mainly driven by large-scale transmission of signals through adherens junctions. In this study, we show that collective movements of epithelial cells can be triggered by polarity signals at the single-cell level through the establishment of coordinated lamellipodial protrusions. We designed a minimalistic model system to generate one-dimensional epithelial trains confined in ring-shaped patterns that recapitulate rotational movements observed in vitro in cellular monolayers and in vivo in genital or follicular cell rotation. Using our system, we demonstrated that cells follow coordinated rotational movements after establishing directed Rac1-dependent polarity over the entire monolayer. Our experimental and numerical approaches show that the maintenance of coordinated migration requires the acquisition of a front&#8211;rear polarity within each single cell but does not require the maintenance of cell&#8211;cell junctions. Taken together, these unexpected findings demonstrate that collective cell dynamics in closed environments as observed in multiple in vitro and in vivo situations can arise from single-cell behaviour through a sustained memory of cell polarity.</p>",[],False,"[""Shreyansh Jain"", ""Victoire M.

article,Enhanced energy coupling for indirect-drive fast-ignition fusion targets,"<p>One of the most promising approaches to reach a high gain in inertial confinement fusion is the fast ignition scheme. In this scheme, a relativistic electron beam is generated; this passes through the imploded plasma and deposits parts of its energy in the core. However, the large angular spread of the relativistic electron beam and the poorly controlled compression of the target affect realization of the fast ignition technique. Here, we demonstrate that indirectly driven (that is, driven by X-rays generated inside a gold hohlraum) implosions with a &#8216;high-foot&#8217; and a short-coast time of less than 200&#8201;ps allow us to tightly compress the shell. Furthermore, we show the ability to optimize the symmetry of the imploding shell by changing the hohlraum length, successfully tuning a suitable tube-shaped shell to compensate for the large angular spread of the relativistic electron beam and to enhance the electron-to-core coupling efficiency via resistive magnetic fields. Benefiting from those experimental techniques, a significant enhancement in neutron yield was achieved in our indirectly driven fast ignition experiments. These results pave the way towards high-coupling fast ignition experiments with indirectly driven targets similar to those at the National Ignition Facility.</p>",[],False,"[""F. Zhang"", ""H. B.
