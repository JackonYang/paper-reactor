letter,Error-corrected gates on an encoded qubit,"<p>To reach their full potential, quantum computers need to be resilient to noise and decoherence. In such a fault-tolerant quantum computer, errors must be corrected in real time to prevent them from propagating between components. This requirement is especially pertinent while applying quantum gates, where the interaction between components can cause errors to spread quickly throughout the system. However, the large overhead involved in most fault-tolerant architectures makes implementing these systems a daunting task, motivating the search for hardware-efficient alternatives. Here, we present a gate enacted by an ancilla transmon on a cavity-encoded logical qubit that is fault-tolerant to ancilla decoherence and compatible with logical error correction. We maintain the purity of the encoded qubit by correcting ancilla-induced errors in real time, yielding a reduction of the logical gate error by a factor of two in the presence of naturally occurring decoherence. We also demonstrate a sixfold suppression of the gate error with increased ancilla relaxation errors and a fourfold suppression with increased ancilla dephasing errors. The results demonstrate that bosonic logical qubits can be controlled by error-prone ancilla qubits without inheriting the ancilla&#8217;s inferior performance. As such, error-corrected ancilla-enabled gates are an important step towards fault-tolerant processing of bosonic qubits.</p>",[],False,"[""Philip Reinhold"", ""Serge Rosenblum"", ""Wen-Long Ma"", ""Luigi Frunzio"", ""Liang Jiang"", ""Robert J.

letter,Error-transparent operations on a logical qubit protected by quantum error correction,"<p>Universal quantum computation is striking for its unprecedented capability in processing information, but its scalability is challenging in practice because of the inevitable environment noise. Although quantum error correction (QEC) techniques have been developed to protect stored quantum information from leading orders of error, the noise-resilient processing of the QEC-protected quantum information is highly demanded but remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate phase gate operations on a logical qubit encoded in a bosonic oscillator in an error-transparent (ET) manner. Inspired by refs. , the ET gates are extended to the bosonic code and are able to tolerate errors on the logical qubit during gate operations, regardless of the random occurrence time of the error. With precisely designed gate Hamiltonians through photon-number-resolved a.c. Stark shifts, the ET condition is fulfilled experimentally. We verify that the ET gates outperform the non-ET gates with a substantial improvement of gate fidelity after an occurrence of the single-photon-loss error. Our ET gates in superconducting quantum circuits can be readily extended to multiple encoded qubits and a universal gate set is within reach, holding the potential for reliable quantum information processing.</p>",[],False,"[""Y.

letter,Emergence of criticality through a cascade of delocalization transitions in quasiperiodic chains,"<p>Conduction through materials crucially depends on how ordered the materials are. Periodically ordered systems exhibit extended Bloch waves that generate metallic bands, whereas disorder is known to limit conduction and localize the motion of particles in a medium. In this context, quasiperiodic systems, which are neither periodic nor disordered, demonstrate exotic conduction properties, self-similar wavefunctions and critical phenomena. Here, we explore the localization properties of waves in a novel family of quasiperiodic chains obtained when continuously interpolating between two paradigmatic limits: the Aubry&#8211;Andr&#233; model, famous for its metal-to-insulator transition, and the Fibonacci chain, known for its critical nature. We discover that the Aubry&#8211;Andr&#233; model evolves into criticality through a cascade of band-selective localization/delocalization transitions that iteratively shape the self-similar critical wavefunctions of the Fibonacci chain. Using experiments on cavity-polariton devices, we observe the first transition and reveal the microscopic origin of the cascade. Our findings offer (1) a unique new insight into understanding the criticality of quasiperiodic chains, (2) a controllable knob by which to engineer band-selective pass filters and (3) a versatile experimental platform with which to further study the interplay of many-body interactions and dissipation in a wide range of quasiperiodic models.</p>",[],False,"[""V.

letter,Ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction and the origin of large magnetic anisotropy in α-RuCl3,"<p>&#945;-RuCl<sub>3</sub> is drawing much attention as a promising candidate for the Kitaev quantum spin liquid. However, despite intensive research efforts, controversy remains about the form of the basic interactions governing the physics of this material. Even the sign of the Kitaev interaction (the bond-dependent anisotropic interaction responsible for Kitaev physics) is still under debate, with conflicting results from theoretical and experimental studies. The significance of the symmetric off-diagonal exchange interaction (referred to as the &#915; term) is another contentious question. Here, we present resonant elastic X-ray scattering data that provide unambiguous experimental constraints to the two leading terms in the magnetic interaction Hamiltonian. We show that the Kitaev interaction (K) is ferromagnetic, and that the &#915; term is antiferromagnetic and comparable in size to the Kitaev interaction. Our findings also provide a natural explanation for the large anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility in &#945;-RuCl<sub>3</sub> as arising from the large &#915; term. We therefore provide a crucial foundation for understanding the interactions underpinning the exotic magnetic behaviours observed in &#945;-RuCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>",[],False,"[""Jennifer A.

letter,Hard antinodal gap revealed by quantum oscillations in the pseudogap regime of underdoped high-Tc superconductors,"<p>An understanding of the missing antinodal electronic excitations in the pseudogap state is essential for uncovering the physics of the underdoped cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The majority of high-temperature experiments performed thus far, however, have been unable to discern whether the antinodal states are rendered unobservable due to their damping or whether they vanish due to their gapping. Here, we distinguish between these two scenarios by using quantum oscillations to examine whether the small Fermi surface pocket, found to occupy only 2% of the Brillouin zone in the underdoped cuprates, exists in isolation against a majority of completely gapped density of states spanning the antinodes, or whether it is thermodynamically coupled to a background of ungapped antinodal states. We find that quantum oscillations associated with the small Fermi surface pocket exhibit a signature sawtooth waveform characteristic of an isolated two-dimensional Fermi surface pocket. This finding reveals that the antinodal states are destroyed by a hard gap that extends over the majority of the Brillouin zone, placing strong constraints on a drastic underlying origin of quasiparticle disappearance over almost the entire Brillouin zone in the pseudogap regime.</p>",[],False,"[""M\u00e1t\u00e9 Hartstein"", ""Yu-Te Hsu"", ""Kimberly A.

letter,Towards satellite-based quantum-secure time transfer,"<p>High-precision time synchronization for remote clocks plays an important role in fundamental science and real-life applications. However, current time synchronization techniques have been shown to be vulnerable to sophisticated adversaries. There is a compelling need for fundamentally new methods to distribute high-precision time information securely. Here, we propose a satellite-based quantum-secure time transfer (QSTT) scheme based on two-way quantum key distribution in free space and experimentally verify the key technologies of the scheme via the Micius quantum satellite. In QSTT, a quantum signal (for example, a single photon) is used as the carrier for both the time transfer and the secret-key generation, offering quantum-enhanced security for transferring the time signal and time information. We perform a satellite-to-ground time synchronization using single-photon-level signals and achieve a quantum bit error rate of less than 1%, a time data rate of 9&#8201;kHz and a time-transfer precision of 30&#8201;ps.

article,Direct measurement of the intrinsic electric dipole moment in pear-shaped thorium-228,"<p>Atomic nuclei with certain combinations of proton and neutron numbers can adopt reflection-asymmetric or octupole-deformed shapes at low excitation energy. These nuclei present a promising avenue in the search for a permanent atomic electric dipole moment&#8212;the existence of which has implications for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Theoretical studies have suggested that certain thorium isotopes may have large octupole deformation.

Here, we report measurements of the lifetimes of low-energy states in <sup>228</sup>Th (Z&#8201;=&#8201;90) with a direct electronic fast-timing technique, the mirror symmetric centroid difference method.

These propagate along the interface in the direction determined by the magnetic field and their interference can turn an incoming electron into an outgoing electron or hole, depending on the phase accumulated by the CAESs along their path.

article,Tunable bandgap renormalization by nonlocal ultra-strong coupling in nanophotonics,"<p>In quantum optics, great effort is being invested in enhancing the interaction of quantum emitters with light. The different approaches include increasing the number of emitters, the laser intensity or the local photonic density of states at the location of an atom-like localized emitter. In contrast, solid-state extended emitters hold an unappreciated promise of vastly greater enhancements through their large number of vacant electronic valence states. However, the majority of valence states are considered optically inaccessible by a conduction electron. We show that, by interfacing three-dimensional (3D) solids with 2D materials, we can unlock the unoccupied valence states by nonlocal optical interactions that lead to ultra-strong coupling for each conduction electron. Consequently, nonlocal optical interactions fundamentally alter the role of the quantum vacuum in solids and create a new type of tunable mass renormalization and bandgap renormalization, which reach tens of millielectronvolts in the example we show. To present quantitative predictions, we develop a non-perturbative macroscopic quantum electrodynamic formalism that we demonstrate on a graphene&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;metal nanostructure.

Using high-fidelity ancilla-based stabilizer measurements, we initialize the cardinal states of the encoded logical qubit with an average logical fidelity of 96.1%. We then repeatedly check for errors using the stabilizer readout and observe that the logical quantum state is preserved with a lifetime and a coherence time longer than those of any of the constituent qubits when no errors are detected.
