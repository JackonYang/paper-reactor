letter,Evidence for quark-matter cores in massive neutron stars,"<p>The theory governing the strong nuclear force&#8212;quantum chromodynamics&#8212;predicts that at sufficiently high energy densities, hadronic nuclear matter undergoes a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons. Although this has been observed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, it is currently an open question whether quark matter exists inside neutron stars. By combining astrophysical observations and theoretical ab initio calculations in a model-independent way, we find that the inferred properties of matter in the cores of neutron stars with mass corresponding to 1.4 solar masses (M<sub>&#8857;</sub>) are compatible with nuclear model calculations. However, the matter in the interior of maximally massive stable neutron stars exhibits characteristics of the deconfined phase, which we interpret as evidence for the presence of quark-matter cores. For the heaviest reliably observed neutron stars with mass M&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;2M<sub>&#8857;</sub>, the presence of quark matter is found to be linked to the behaviour of the speed of sound c<sub>s</sub> in strongly interacting matter. If the conformal bound \({c}_{\rm{s}}^{2}\le 1/3\) (ref. ) is not strongly violated, massive neutron stars are predicted to have sizable quark-matter cores. This finding has important implications for the phenomenology of neutron stars and affects the dynamics of neutron star mergers with at least one sufficiently massive participant.</p>",[],True,"[""Eemeli Annala"", ""Tyler Gorda"", ""Aleksi Kurkela"", ""Joonas N\u00e4ttil\u00e4"", ""Aleksi Vuorinen""]","Annala, E., Gorda, T., Kurkela, A. et al.

letter,Atomic superheterodyne receiver based on microwave-dressed Rydberg spectroscopy,"<p>Highly sensitive phase- and frequency-resolved detection of microwave electric fields is of central importance in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, meteorology, communication and microwave quantum technology. Atom-based electrometers promise traceable standards for microwave electrometry, but their best sensitivity is currently limited to a few &#956;V&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> (refs. ) and they only yield information about the field amplitude and polarization. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new microwave electric field sensor&#8212;the Rydberg-atom superheterodyne receiver (superhet). The sensitivity of this technique scales favourably, achieving even 55&#8201;nV&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> with a modest set-up. The minimum detectable field of 780&#8201;pV&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> is three orders of magnitude smaller than what can be reached by existing atomic electrometers. The Rydberg-atom superhet allows SI-traceable measurements, reaching uncertainty levels of 10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>&#8201;V&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> when measuring a sub-&#956;V&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> field, which has been inaccessible so far with atomic sensors. Our method also enables phase and frequency detection. In sensing Doppler frequencies, sub-&#956;Hz precision is reached for fields of a few hundred nV&#8201;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>. This work is a first step towards realizing electromagnetic-wave quantum sensors with quantum projection noise-limited sensitivity.

letter,Electron acceleration in laboratory-produced turbulent collisionless shocks,"<p>Astrophysical collisionless shocks are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. Generated by violent interactions of supersonic plasma flows with the interstellar medium, supernova remnant shocks are observed to amplify magnetic fields and accelerate electrons and protons to highly relativistic speeds. In the well-established model of diffusive shock acceleration, relativistic particles are accelerated by repeated shock crossings. However, this requires a separate mechanism that pre-accelerates particles to enable shock crossing. This is known as the &#8216;injection problem&#8217;, which is particularly relevant for electrons, and remains one of the most important puzzles in shock acceleration. In most astrophysical shocks, the details of the shock structure cannot be directly resolved, making it challenging to identify the injection mechanism. Here we report results from laser-driven plasma flow experiments, and related simulations, that probe the formation of turbulent collisionless shocks in conditions relevant to young supernova remnants. We show that electrons can be effectively accelerated in a first-order Fermi process by small-scale turbulence produced within the shock transition to relativistic non-thermal energies, helping overcome the injection problem. Our observations provide new insight into electron injection at shocks and open the way for controlled laboratory studies of the physics underlying cosmic accelerators.</p>",[],False,"[""F.

letter,Repulsive photons in a quantum nonlinear medium,"<p>The ability to control strongly interacting light quanta (photons) is of central importance in quantum science and engineering. Recently it was shown that such strong interactions can be engineered in specially prepared quantum optical systems. Here, we demonstrate a method for coherent control of strongly interacting photons, extending quantum nonlinear optics into the domain of repulsive photons. This is achieved by coherently coupling photons to several atomic states, including strongly interacting Rydberg levels in a cold Rubidium gas. Using this approach we demonstrate both repulsive and attractive interactions between individual photons and characterize them by the measured two- and three-photon correlation functions. For the repulsive case, we demonstrate signatures of interference and self ordering from three-photon measurements. These observations open a route to study strongly interacting dissipative systems and quantum matter composed of light such as a crystal of individual photons.</p>",[],False,"[""Sergio H.

Experiments have shown correlated insulating, superconducting and ferromagnetic states when the flat band is partially filled. The proximity of superconductivity to correlated insulators suggested a close relationship between these states, reminiscent of the cuprates where superconductivity arises by doping a Mott insulator. Here, we show that superconductivity can appear far away from the correlated insulating states. Although both superconductivity and correlated insulating behaviour are strongest near the flat-band condition, superconductivity survives to larger detuning of the angle.

article,Polarizing an antiferromagnet by optical engineering of the crystal field,"<p>Strain engineering is widely used to manipulate the electronic and magnetic properties of complex materials. For example, the piezomagnetic effect provides an attractive route to control magnetism with strain. In this effect, the staggered spin structure of an antiferromagnet is decompensated by breaking the crystal field symmetry, which induces a ferrimagnetic polarization. Piezomagnetism is especially appealing because, unlike magnetostriction, it couples strain and magnetization at linear order, and allows for bi-directional control suitable for memory and spintronics applications. However, its use in functional devices has so far been hindered by the slow speed and large uniaxial strains required. Here we show that the essential features of piezomagnetism can be reproduced with optical phonons alone, which can be driven by light to large amplitudes without changing the volume and hence beyond the elastic limits of the material. We exploit nonlinear, three-phonon mixing to induce the desired crystal field distortions in the antiferromagnet CoF<sub>2</sub>. Through this effect, we generate a ferrimagnetic moment of 0.2 &#956;<sub>B</sub> per unit cell, nearly three orders of magnitude larger than achieved with mechanical strain.</p>",[],False,"[""Ankit S.

article,Destabilization of hidden order in URu2Si2 under magnetic field and pressure,"<p>The mystery of the hidden-order phase in the correlated electron paramagnet URu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> is still unsolved. To address this problem, one strategy is to search for clues in the subtle competition between this state and neighbouring magnetically ordered states. It is now well established that long-range antiferromagnetic order can be stabilized in this metal when it is under pressure and that a spin-density wave manifests when a magnetic field is applied along the easy magnetic axis c. However, the full boundaries of the hidden-order phase in the pressure&#8211;magnetic-field plane have not been determined so far. Here we present a systematic investigation of URu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> under combined high pressures and intense magnetic fields. The boundaries of the hidden-order, antiferromagnetic and spin-density-wave phases are mapped out, indicating an intricate three-dimensional phase diagram. We show that the field-induced spin-density-wave and hidden-order phases disappear in favour of antiferromagnetism at high pressure. Interestingly, a large number of phase boundaries are controlled by the field and pressure dependences of a single parameter. This gives new constraints for theories that model the electronic correlations and ordered phases in URu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>.</p>",[],False,"[""W. Knafo"", ""S. Araki"", ""G. Lapertot"", ""D.

article,Multi-scale spatial heterogeneity enhances particle clearance in airway ciliary arrays,"<p>Mucus clearance constitutes the primary defence of the respiratory system against viruses, bacteria and environmental insults. This transport across the entire airway emerges from the integrated activity of thousands of multiciliated cells, each containing hundreds of cilia, which together must coordinate their spatial arrangement, alignment and motility. The mechanisms of fluid transport have been studied extensively at the level of an individual cilium, collectively moving metachronal waves and, more generally, the hydrodynamics of active matter. However, the connection between local cilia architecture and the topology of the flows they generate remains largely unexplored. Here, we image the mouse airway from subcellular (nm) to organ (mm) scales, characterizing quantitatively its ciliary arrangement and the generated flows. Locally, we measure heterogeneity in both cilia organization and flow structure, but, across the trachea, fluid transport is coherent. To examine this result, a hydrodynamic model was developed for a systematic exploration of different tissue architectures. Surprisingly, we find that disorder enhances particle clearance, whether it originates from fluctuations, heterogeneity in multiciliated cell arrangement or ciliary misalignment. This resembles elements of &#8216;stochastic resonance&#8217;, in the sense that noise can improve the function of the system.

article,Human information processing in complex networks,"<p>Humans communicate using systems of interconnected stimuli or concepts&#8212;from language and music to literature and science&#8212;yet it remains unclear how, if at all, the structure of these networks supports the communication of information. Although information theory provides tools to quantify the information produced by a system, traditional metrics do not account for the inefficient ways that humans process this information. Here, we develop an analytical framework to study the information generated by a system as perceived by a human observer. We demonstrate experimentally that this perceived information depends critically on a system&#8217;s network topology. Applying our framework to several real networks, we find that they communicate a large amount of information (having high entropy) and do so efficiently (maintaining low divergence from human expectations). Moreover, we show that such efficient communication arises in networks that are simultaneously heterogeneous, with high-degree hubs, and clustered, with tightly connected modules&#8212;the two defining features of hierarchical organization. Together, these results suggest that many communication networks are constrained by the pressures of information transmission, and that these pressures select for specific structural features.</p>",[],False,"[""Christopher W.

article,Undulation enables gliding in flying snakes,"<p>When flying snakes glide, they use aerial undulation. To determine if aerial undulation is a flight control strategy or a non-functional behavioural vestige of lateral undulation, we measured snake glides using high-speed motion capture and developed a new dynamical model of gliding. Reconstructions of the snake&#8217;s wing-body reveal that aerial undulation is composed of horizontal and vertical waves, whose phases differ by 90&#176; and whose frequencies differ by a factor of two. Using these results, we developed a three-dimensional mathematical model of snake flight that incorporates aerodynamic and inertial effects. Although simulated glides without undulation attained some horizontal distance, they are biologically unrealistic because they failed due to roll and pitch instabilities. In contrast, the inclusion of undulation stabilized the rotational motion and markedly increased glide performance. This work demonstrates that aerial undulation in snakes serves a different function than known uses of undulation in other animals, and suggests a new template of control for dynamic flying robots.</p>",[],False,"[""Isaac J.

article,Growth of concomitant laser-driven collisionless and resistive electron filamentation instabilities over large spatiotemporal scales,"<p>Collective processes in plasmas often induce microinstabilities that play an important role in many space or laboratory plasma environments. Particularly notable is the Weibel-type current filamentation instability, which is believed to drive the creation of collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized astrophysical plasmas. Here, this instability class is studied through interactions of ultraintense and short laser pulses with solid foils, leading to localized generation of megaelectronvolt electrons. Proton radiographic measurements of both low- and high-resistivity targets show two distinct, superimposed electromagnetic field patterns arising from the interpenetration of the megaelectronvolt electrons and the background plasma. Particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical estimates suggest that the collisionless Weibel instability building up in the dilute expanding plasmas formed at the target surfaces causes the observed azimuthally symmetric electromagnetic filaments. For a sufficiently high resistivity of the target foil, an additional resistive instability is triggered in the bulk target, giving rise to radially elongated filaments. The data reveal the growth of both filamentation instabilities over large temporal (tens of picoseconds) and spatial (hundreds of micrometres) scales.</p>",[],False,"[""C. Ruyer"", ""S.

article,Braiding photonic topological zero modes,"<p>A remarkable property of quantum mechanics in two-dimensional space is its ability to support &#8216;anyons&#8217;, particles that are neither fermions nor bosons. Theory predicts that these exotic excitations can exist as bound states confined near topological defects, such as Majorana zero modes trapped in vortices in topological superconductors. Intriguingly, in the simplest cases the non-trivial phase that arises when such defects are &#8216;braided&#8217; around one another is not intrinsically quantum mechanical; instead, it can be viewed as a manifestation of the geometric (Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry) phase in wave mechanics, which makes possible the simulation of such phenomena in classical systems. Here, we report the experimental measurement of the geometric phase owing to such a braiding process. These measurements are obtained with an interferometer constructed from highly tunable two-dimensional arrays of photonic waveguides. Our results introduce photonic lattices as a versatile platform for the experimental study of topological defects and their braiding, and complement ongoing efforts in the study of solid-state systems and cold atomic gases.</p>",[],False,"[""Jiho Noh"", ""Thomas Schuster"", ""Thomas Iadecola"", ""Sheng Huang"", ""Mohan Wang"", ""Kevin P.
