letter,Experimental extraction of the quantum effective action for a non-equilibrium many-body system,"<p>On the fundamental level, quantum fluctuations or entanglement lead to complex dynamical behaviour in many-body systems for which a description as emergent phenomena can be found within the framework of quantum field theory. A central quantity in these efforts, containing all information about the measurable physical properties, is the quantum effective action. Though non-equilibrium quantum dynamics can be exactly formulated in terms of the quantum effective action, finding solutions is in general beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Here, we present a strategy to determine the non-equilibrium quantum effective action using analogue quantum simulators, and demonstrate our method experimentally with a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose gas out of equilibrium. Spatially resolved snapshots of the complex-valued transversal spin field allow us to infer the quantum effective action up to fourth order in an expansion in one-particle irreducible correlation functions at equal times. We uncover a strong suppression of the irreducible four vertex emerging at low momenta in the highly occupied regime far from equilibrium where perturbative descriptions fail. Our work constitutes a new realm of large-scale analogue quantum computing, where highly controlled synthetic quantum systems provide the means for solving theoretical problems in high-energy and condensed-matter physics with an experimental approach.</p>",[],False,"[""Maximilian Pr\u00fcfer"", ""Torsten V.

letter,Probing chiral edge dynamics and bulk topology of a synthetic Hall system,"<p>Quantum Hall systems are characterized by quantization of the Hall conductance&#8212;a bulk property rooted in the topological structure of the underlying quantum states. In condensed matter devices, material imperfections hinder a direct connection to simple topological models. Artificial systems, such as photonic platforms or cold atomic gases, open novel possibilities by enabling specific probes of topology or flexible manipulation, for example using synthetic dimensions. However, the relevance of topological properties requires the notion of a bulk, which was missing in previous works using synthetic dimensions of limited sizes. Here, we realize a quantum Hall system using ultracold dysprosium atoms in a two-dimensional geometry formed by one spatial dimension and one synthetic dimension encoded in the atomic spin J&#8201;=&#8201;8. We demonstrate that the large number of magnetic sublevels leads to distinct bulk and edge behaviours. Furthermore, we measure the Hall drift and reconstruct the local Chern marker, an observable that has remained, so far, experimentally inaccessible. In the centre of the synthetic dimension&#8212;a bulk of 11 states out of 17&#8212;the Chern marker reaches 98(5)% of the quantized value expected for a topological system.

letter,Spin phase diagram of the interacting quantum Hall liquid,"<p>Measurement of the ground-state spin polarization of quantum systems offers great potential for the discovery and characterization of correlated electronic states. However, spin polarization measurements have mainly involved optical and NMR techniques that perturb the delicate ground states and, for quantum Hall systems, have provided conflicting results. Here we present spin-resolved pulsed tunnelling (SRPT) that precisely determines the phase diagram of the ground-state spin polarization as a function of magnetic field and Landau level (LL) filling factor (&#957;) with negligible perturbation to the system. Our phase diagram shows a variety of polarized, unpolarized and topological spin states in the lowest (N&#8201;=&#8201;0) LL, which can largely be described by a weakly interacting composite fermion (CF) model. However, the phase diagram shows unexpected behaviour in the N&#8201;=&#8201;1 LL. We observe fully polarized &#957;&#8201;=&#8201;5/2 and 8/3 states but a partially depolarized &#957;&#8201;=&#8201;7/3 state. This behaviour deviates from the conventional theoretical picture of weakly interacting fractional quasiparticles, but instead suggests unusual electronic correlations and the possibility of new non-Abelian phases. The results establish SRPT as a powerful technique for investigating correlated electron phenomena.</p>",[],False,"[""H. M. Yoo"", ""K. W. Baldwin"", ""K. West"", ""L. Pfeiffer"", ""R. C.

letter,Berry curvature memory through electrically driven stacking transitions,"<p>In two-dimensional layered quantum materials, the stacking order of the layers determines both the crystalline symmetry and electronic properties such as the Berry curvature, topology and electron correlation. Electrical stimuli can influence quasiparticle interactions and the free-energy landscape, making it possible to dynamically modify the stacking order and reveal hidden structures that host different quantum properties. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven stacking transitions that can be applied to design non-volatile memory based on Berry curvature in few-layer WTe<sub>2</sub>. The interplay of out-of-plane electric fields and electrostatic doping controls in-plane interlayer sliding and creates multiple polar and centrosymmetric stacking orders. In situ nonlinear Hall transport reveals that such stacking rearrangements result in a layer-parity-selective Berry curvature memory in momentum space, where the sign reversal of the Berry curvature and its dipole only occurs in odd-layer crystals. Our findings open an avenue towards exploring coupling between topology, electron correlations and ferroelectricity in hidden stacking orders and demonstrate a new low-energy-cost, electrically controlled topological memory in the atomically thin limit.</p>",[],False,"[""Jun Xiao"", ""Ying Wang"", ""Hua Wang"", ""C.

letter,Origin of strong-field-induced low-order harmonic generation in amorphous quartz,"<p>Kerr-type nonlinearities form the basis for our physical understanding of nonlinear optical phenomena in condensed matter, such as self-focusing, solitary waves and wave mixing. In strong fields, they are complemented by higher-order nonlinearities that enable high-harmonic generation, which is currently understood as the interplay of light-driven intraband charge dynamics and interband recombination. Remarkably, the nonlinear response emerging from the subcycle injection dynamics of electrons into the conduction band, that is from ionization, has been almost completely overlooked in solids and only partially considered in the gas phase. Here, we reveal this strong-field-induced nonlinearity in a-SiO<sub>2</sub> as a typical wide-bandgap dielectric by means of time-resolved, low-order wave-mixing experiments, and show that, close to the material damage threshold, the so far unexplored injection current provides the leading contribution. The sensitivity of the harmonic emission to the subcycle ionization dynamics offers an original approach to characterize the evolution of laser-induced plasma formation in optical microprocessing.</p>",[],False,"[""P.

article,Quantum advantage with noisy shallow circuits,"<p>As increasingly sophisticated prototypes of quantum computers are being developed, a pressing challenge is to find computational problems that can be solved by an intermediate-scale quantum computer, but are beyond the capabilities of existing classical computers. Previous work in this direction has introduced computational problems that can be solved with certainty by quantum circuits of depth independent of the input size (so-called &#8216;shallow&#8217; circuits) but cannot be solved with high probability by any shallow classical circuit. Here we show that such a separation in computational power persists even when the shallow quantum circuits are restricted to geometrically local gates in three dimensions and corrupted by noise. We also present a streamlined quantum algorithm that is shown to achieve a quantum advantage in a one-dimensional geometry. The latter may be amenable to experimental implementation with the current generation of quantum computers.</p>",[],False,"[""Sergey Bravyi"", ""David Gosset"", ""Robert K\u00f6nig"", ""Marco Tomamichel""]","Bravyi, S., Gosset, D., König, R. et al.

article,Implementation of a canonical phase measurement with quantum feedback,"<p>Much of modern metrology and communication technology encodes information in electromagnetic waves, typically as an amplitude or phase. Although current hardware can perform near-ideal measurements of photon number or field amplitude, the ability to perform an ideal phase measurement is still lacking, even in principle. In this work, we implement a single-shot canonical phase measurement on a one-photon wave packet, which surpasses the current standard of heterodyne detection and is optimal for single-shot phase estimation. By applying quantum feedback to a Josephson parametric amplifier, our system adaptively changes its measurement basis during photon arrival and allows us to validate the detector&#8217;s performance by tracking the quantum state of the photon source. These results demonstrate that quantum feedback can both enhance the precision of a detector and enable it to measure new classes of physical observables.</p>",[],False,"[""Leigh S.

We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a &#8216;classical shadow&#8217;, can be used to predict many different properties; order \({\mathrm{log}}\,(M)\) measurements suffice to accurately predict M different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians.

article,Realization of an anomalous Floquet topological system with ultracold atoms,"<p>Coherent control via periodic modulation, also known as Floquet engineering, has emerged as a powerful experimental method for the realization of novel quantum systems with exotic properties. In particular, it has been employed to study topological phenomena in a variety of different platforms. In driven systems, the topological properties of the quasienergy bands can often be determined by standard topological invariants, such as Chern numbers, which are commonly used in static systems. However, due to the periodic nature of the quasienergy spectrum, this topological description is incomplete and new invariants are required to fully capture the topological properties of these driven settings. Most prominently, there are two-dimensional anomalous Floquet systems that exhibit robust chiral edge modes, despite all Chern numbers being equal to zero. Here we realize such a system with bosonic atoms in a periodically driven honeycomb lattice and infer the complete set of topological invariants from energy gap measurements and local Hall deflections.</p>",[],False,"[""Karen Wintersperger"", ""Christoph Braun"", ""F.

Several experiments have suggested that this phase ends at a critical hole doping level p*, but the nature of the ground state for lower doping is still debated.

In this material, the antiferromagnetic-glass phase extends from the doped Mott insulator at p = 0.02 up to p* &#8776; 0.19, which provides a connection between the pseudogap and the physics of the Mott insulator.

article,Amplification of waves from a rotating body,"<p>In 1971, Zel&#8217;dovich predicted that quantum fluctuations and classical waves reflected from a rotating absorbing cylinder will gain energy and be amplified. This concept, which is a key step towards the understanding that black holes may amplify quantum fluctuations, has not been verified experimentally owing to the challenging experimental requirement that the cylinder rotation rate must be larger than the incoming wave frequency. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that these conditions can be satisfied with acoustic waves. We show that low-frequency acoustic modes with orbital angular momentum are transmitted through an absorbing rotating disk and amplified by up to 30% or more when the disk rotation rate satisfies the Zel&#8217;dovich condition.

article,Universal elastic mechanism for stinger design,"<p>Living organisms use stingers that vary in length L over eight orders of magnitude, from a few tens of nanometres to several metres, across a wide array of biological taxa. Despite the extreme variation in size, their structures are strikingly similar. However, the mechanism responsible for this remarkable morphological convergence remains unknown. Using basic physical arguments and biomimetic experiments, we reveal an optimal design strategy that links their length, base diameter d<sub>0</sub>, Young&#8217;s modulus E and friction force per unit area &#956;p<sub>0</sub>. This principle can be framed simply as \({d}_{0} \approx {(\mu {p}_{0}/E)}^{1/3}L\). Existing data from measurements on viruses, algae, marine invertebrates, terrestrial invertebrates, plants, terrestrial vertebrates, marine vertebrates&#8212;as well as man-made objects such as nails, needles and weapons&#8212;are consistent with our predictions. Our results highlight the evolutionary adaptation of mechanical traits to the constraints imposed by friction, elastic stability and cost.</p>",[],False,"[""Kaare H.
