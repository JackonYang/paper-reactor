letter,Flat bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides,"<p>The crystal structure of a material creates a periodic potential that electrons move through giving rise to its electronic band structure. When two-dimensional materials are stacked, the resulting moir&#233; pattern introduces an additional periodicity so that the twist angle between the layers becomes an extra degree of freedom for the resulting heterostructure. As this angle changes, the electronic band structure is modified leading to the possibility of flat bands with localized states and enhanced electronic correlations. In transition metal dichalcogenides, flat bands have been theoretically predicted to occur for long moir&#233; wavelengths over a range of twist angles around 0&#176; and 60&#176; (ref. ) giving much wider versatility than magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we show the existence of a flat band in the electronic structure of 3&#176; and 57.5&#176; twisted bilayer WSe<sub>2</sub> samples using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Our direct spatial mapping of wavefunctions at the flat-band energy show that the localization of the flat bands is different for 3&#176; and 57.5&#176;, in agreement with first-principles density functional theory calculations.</p>",[],False,"[""Zhiming Zhang"", ""Yimeng Wang"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Keiji Ueno"", ""Emanuel Tutuc"", ""Brian J.

letter,Tunable strain soliton networks confine electrons in van der Waals materials,"<p>Twisting or sliding two-dimensional crystals with respect to each other gives rise to moir&#233; patterns determined by the difference in their periodicities. Such lattice mismatches can exist for several reasons: differences between the intrinsic lattice constants of the two layers, as is the case for graphene on BN; rotations between the two lattices, as is the case for twisted bilayer graphene; and strains between two identical layers in a bilayer. Moir&#233; patterns are responsible for a number of new electronic phenomena observed in recent years in van der Waals heterostructures, including the observation of superlattice Dirac points for graphene on BN, collective electronic phases in twisted bilayers and twisted double bilayers, and trapping of excitons in the moir&#233; potential. An open question is whether we can use moir&#233; potentials to achieve strong trapping potentials for electrons. Here, we report a technique to achieve deep, deterministic trapping potentials via strain-based moir&#233; engineering in van der Waals materials. We use strain engineering to create on-demand soliton networks in transition metal dichalcogenides. Intersecting solitons form a honeycomb-like network resulting from the three-fold symmetry of the adhesion potential between layers. The vertices of this network occur in bound pairs with different interlayer stacking arrangements. One vertex of the pair is found to be an efficient trap for electrons, displaying two states that are deeply confined within the semiconductor gap and have a spatial extent of 2&#8201;nm. Soliton networks thus provide a path to engineer deeply confined states with a strain-dependent tunable spatial separation, without the necessity of introducing chemical defects into the host materials.</p>",[],False,"[""Drew Edelberg"", ""Hemant Kumar"", ""Vivek Shenoy"", ""H\u00e9ctor Ochoa"", ""Abhay N.

letter,Continuous monitoring of a trapped superconducting spin,"<p>Readout and control of electrostatically confined electrons in semiconductors are key primitives of quantum information processing with solid-state spin qubits. In superconductor&#8211;semiconductor heterostructures, localized electronic modes known as Andreev levels result from confinement that is provided by the pair potential. Unlike electronic modes confined exclusively via electrostatic effects, Andreev levels carry supercurrent. Therefore, they naturally integrate with the techniques of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) that have been developed in the field of superconducting qubits and used to detect pairs of quasiparticles that are trapped in Andreev levels. Here, we demonstrate single-shot cQED readout of the spin of an individual quasiparticle trapped in the Andreev levels of a semiconductor nanowire Josephson element. Owing to a spin-orbit interaction in the nanowire, this &#8216;superconducting spin&#8217; directly determines the flow of supercurrent through the element. We harnessed this spin-dependent supercurrent to achieve both a zero-field spin splitting and a long-range interaction between the quasiparticle and a superconducting microwave resonator. Measurement of the resultant spin-dependent resonator frequency yielded quantum non-demolition spin readout with 92% fidelity in 1.9&#8201;&#956;s, which enabled us to monitor the quasiparticle spin in real time. These results pave the way for superconducting spin qubits that operate at zero magnetic field and for time-domain measurements of Majorana zero modes.</p>",[],False,"[""M. Hays"", ""V.

letter,Chiral phonons in the pseudogap phase of cuprates,"<p>The nature of the pseudogap phase of cuprates remains a major puzzle. One of its signatures is a large negative thermal Hall conductivity, whose origin is as yet unknown. This is observed even in the undoped Mott insulator La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, in which the charge carriers are localized and therefore cannot be responsible. Here, we show that the thermal Hall conductivity of La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> is roughly isotropic; that is, for heat transport parallel and normal to the CuO<sub>2</sub> planes, it is nearly the same. This shows that the Hall response must come from phonons, as they are the only heat carriers that are able to move with the same ease both normal and parallel to the planes. For doping levels higher than the critical doping level at which the pseudogap phase ends, both La<sub>1.6&#8722;x</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and La<sub>1.8&#8722;x</sub>Eu<sub>0.2</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> show no thermal Hall signal for a heat current normal to the planes, which establishes that phonons have zero Hall response outside the pseudogap phase. Inside the pseudogap phase, the phonons must become chiral to generate the Hall response, but the mechanism by which this happens remains to be identified. It must be intrinsic (from a coupling of phonons to their electronic environment) rather than extrinsic (from structural defects or impurities), as these are the same on both sides of critical doping.</p>",[],False,"[""G.

article,Unscrambling entanglement through a complex medium,"<p>The transfer of quantum information through a noisy environment is a central challenge in the fields of quantum communication, imaging and nanophotonics. In particular, high-dimensional quantum states of light enable quantum networks with significantly higher information capacities and noise robustness as compared with qubits. However, although qubit entanglement has been distributed over large distances through free space and fibre, the transport of high-dimensional entanglement is hindered by the complexity of the channel, which encompasses effects such as free-space turbulence or mode mixing in multimode waveguides. Here, we demonstrate the transport of six-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement through a 2-m-long, commercial multimode fibre with 84.4% fidelity. We show how the entanglement can itself be used to measure the transmission matrix of the complex medium, allowing the recovery of quantum correlations that were initially lost. Using a unique property of entangled states, the medium is rendered transparent to entanglement by carefully &#8216;scrambling&#8217; the photon that did not enter it, rather than unscrambling the photon that did. Our work overcomes a primary challenge in the fields of quantum communication and imaging, and opens a new pathway towards the control of complex scattering processes in the quantum regime.</p>",[],False,"[""Natalia Herrera Valencia"", ""Suraj Goel"", ""Will McCutcheon"", ""Hugo Defienne"", ""Mehul Malik""]","Valencia, N.H., Goel, S., McCutcheon, W. et al.

article,Casimir spring and dilution in macroscopic cavity optomechanics,"<p>The Casimir force was predicted in 1948 as a force arising between macroscopic bodies from the zero-point energy. At finite temperatures, it has been shown that a thermal Casimir force exists due to thermal rather than zero-point energy and there are a growing number of experiments that characterize the effect at a range of temperatures and distances. In addition, in the rapidly evolving field of cavity optomechanics, there is an endeavour to manipulate phonons and enhance coherence. We demonstrate a way to realize a Casimir spring and engineer dilution in macroscopic optomechanics, by coupling a metallic SiN membrane to a photonic re-entrant cavity. The attraction of the spatially localized Casimir spring mimics a non-contacting boundary condition, giving rise to increased strain and acoustic coherence through dissipation dilution. This provides a way to manipulate phonons via thermal photons leading to &#8216;in situ&#8217; reconfigurable mechanical states, to reduce loss mechanisms and to create additional types of acoustic nonlinearity&#8212;all at room temperature.</p>",[],False,"[""J.

article,Resonant phase-matching between a light wave and a free-electron wavefunction,"<p>Quantum light&#8211;matter interactions of bound electron systems have been studied extensively. By contrast, quantum interactions of free electrons with light have only become accessible in recent years, following the discovery of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). So far, the fundamental free electron&#8211;light interaction in all PINEM experiments has remained weak due to its localized near-field nature, which imposes an energy&#8211;momentum mismatch between electrons and light. Here, we demonstrate a strong interaction between free-electron waves and light waves, resulting from precise energy&#8211;momentum phase-matching with the extended propagating light field. By exchanging hundreds of photons with the field, each electron simultaneously accelerates and decelerates in a coherent manner. Consequently, each electron&#8217;s quantum wavefunction evolves into a quantized energy comb, spanning a bandwidth of over 1,700&#8201;eV, requiring us to extend the PINEM theory. Our observation of coherent electron phase-matching with a propagating wave is a type of inverse-Cherenkov interaction that occurs with a quantum electron wavefunction, demonstrating how the extended nature of the electron wavefunction can alter stimulated electron&#8211;light interactions.</p>",[],False,"[""Raphael Dahan"", ""Saar Nehemia"", ""Michael Shentcis"", ""Ori Reinhardt"", ""Yuval Adiv"", ""Xihang Shi"", ""Orr Be\u2019er"", ""Morgan H.

article,Photo-excitation of long-lived transient intermediates in ultracold reactions,"<p>In many chemical reactions, the transformation from reactants to products is mediated by transient intermediate complexes. For gas-phase reactions involving molecules with a few atoms, these complexes typically live on the order of 10&#8201;ps or less before dissociating, and are therefore rarely influenced by external processes. Here, we demonstrate that the transient intermediate complex K<sub>2</sub>Rb<sub>2</sub>*, formed from collisions between ultracold KRb molecules, undergoes rapid photo-excitation in the presence of a continuous-wave laser source at 1,064&#8201;nm, a wavelength commonly used to confine ultracold molecules. These excitations are facilitated by the exceptionally long lifetime of the complex under ultracold conditions. Indeed, by monitoring the change in the complex population after the sudden removal of the excitation light, we directly measure the lifetime of the complex to be 360&#8201;&#177;&#8201;30&#8201;ns, in agreement with our calculations based on the Rice&#8211;Ramsperger&#8211;Kassel&#8211;Marcus (RRKM) statistical theory. Our results shed light on the origin of the two-body loss widely observed in ultracold molecule experiments. Additionally, the long complex lifetime, coupled with the observed photo-excitation pathway, opens up the possibility to spectroscopically probe the structure of the complex with high resolution, thus elucidating the reaction dynamics.</p>",[],False,"[""Yu Liu"", ""Ming-Guang Hu"", ""Matthew A.

article,Non-Abelian reciprocal braiding of Weyl points and its manifestation in ZrTe,"<p>Weyl semimetals in three-dimensional crystals provide the paradigm example of topologically protected band nodes. It is usually taken for granted that a pair of colliding Weyl points annihilate whenever they carry opposite chiral charge. In stark contrast, here we report that Weyl points in systems that are symmetric under the composition of time reversal with a &#960; rotation are characterized by a non-Abelian topological invariant. The topological charges of the Weyl points are transformed via braid phase factors, which arise upon exchange inside symmetric planes of the reciprocal momentum space. We elucidate this process with an elementary two-dimensional tight-binding model that is implementable in cold-atom set-ups and in photonic systems. In three dimensions, interplay of the non-Abelian topology with point-group symmetry is shown to enable topological phase transitions in which pairs of Weyl points may scatter or convert into nodal-line rings. By combining our theoretical arguments with first-principles calculations, we predict that Weyl points occurring near the Fermi level of zirconium telluride carry non-trivial values of the non-Abelian charge, and that uniaxial compression strain drives a non-trivial conversion of the Weyl points into nodal lines.</p>",[],False,"[""Adrien Bouhon"", ""QuanSheng Wu"", ""Robert-Jan Slager"", ""Hongming Weng"", ""Oleg V.

article,Macromolecular crowding acts as a physical regulator of intracellular transport,"<p>Eukaryotic cell processes depend on molecular motors to transport cargo along cytoskeletal filaments, and the response of these mechanoenzymes to external forces shapes their cellular function. These responses have been largely mapped out in dilute, in vitro media. The cytosol, however, is host to a high concentration of macromolecules, and this crowding can alter protein conformation, binding rates, reaction kinetics and therefore motor function. Here, we use live-cell and single-molecule imaging and optical tweezer force measurements to uncover the consequences of macromolecular crowding on cargo transport by kinesin-1 motors. Surprisingly, we find that crowding significantly slows transport by teams of motors, while having no effect on single-motor velocity. We find that this emergent property of kinesin teams results from the increased sensitivity of the individual motors to hindering load when in a crowded medium. We explain this increased sensitivity using a model where entropic forces due to crowding push the two kinesin heads together into a more compact configuration when the motor is poised to take a step. Our results highlight the importance of motor&#8211;motor interactions in cargo transport, explain the long-observed variability of cargo velocity and suggest the use of crowding as a control parameter to study kinesin&#8217;s mechanochemical cycle.</p>",[],False,"[""Guilherme Nettesheim"", ""Ibtissem Nabti"", ""Chandrashekhar U.

article,Cooperative pattern formation in multi-component bacterial systems through reciprocal motility regulation,"<p>Self-organization is a prerequisite of biological complexity. At the population level, it amounts to spontaneously sorting different individuals through space and time. Here, we reveal a simple mechanism by which different populations of motile cells can self-organize through a reciprocal control of their motilities. We first show how the reciprocal activation of motility between two populations of engineered Escherichia coli makes an initially mixed population of cells segregate, leading to out-of-phase population oscillations without the need of any preexisting positional or orientational cues. By redesigning the interaction, the original segregation between the two populations can be turned into co-localization. We account for this self-organization using a theoretical model that shows the reciprocal control of motility to be a robust and versatile self-organization pathway in multi-component systems. We finally show how our theoretical and experimental results can be generalized to three interacting bacterial populations.</p>",[],False,"[""A. I. Curatolo"", ""N. Zhou"", ""Y. Zhao"", ""C.

article,Active mucus–cilia hydrodynamic coupling drives self-organization of human bronchial epithelium,"<p>The respiratory tract is protected by mucus, a complex fluid transported along the epithelial surface by the coordinated beating of millions of microscopic cilia, hence the name of mucociliary clearance. Its impairment is associated with all severe chronic respiratory diseases. Yet, the relationship between ciliary density and the spatial scale of mucus transport, as well as the mechanisms that drive ciliary-beat orientations are much debated. Here, we show on polarized human bronchial epithelia that mucus swirls and circular orientational order of the underlying ciliary beats emerge and grow during ciliogenesis, until a macroscopic mucus transport is achieved for physiological ciliary densities. By establishing that the macroscopic ciliary-beat order is lost and recovered by removing and adding mucus, respectively, we demonstrate that cilia&#8211;mucus hydrodynamic interactions govern the collective dynamics of ciliary-beat directions. We propose a two-dimensional model that predicts a phase diagram of mucus transport in accordance with the experiments. This paves the way to a predictive in silico modelling of bronchial mucus transport in health and disease.</p>",[],False,"[""Etienne Loiseau"", ""Simon Gsell"", ""Aude Nommick"", ""Charline Jomard"", ""Delphine Gras"", ""Pascal Chanez"", ""Umberto D\u2019Ortona"", ""Laurent Kodjabachian"", ""Julien Favier"", ""Annie Viallat""]","Loiseau, E., Gsell, S., Nommick, A. et al.
