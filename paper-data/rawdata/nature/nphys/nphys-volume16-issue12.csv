letter,Exact theory for superconductivity in a doped Mott insulator,"<p>Because the cuprate superconductors are doped Mott insulators, it would be advantageous to solve even a toy model that exhibits both Mottness and superconductivity. We consider the Hatsugai&#8211;Kohmoto model, an exactly solvable system that is a prototypical Mott insulator. Upon either doping or reducing the interaction strength, our exact calculations show that the system becomes a non-Fermi liquid metal with a superconducting instability. In the presence of a weak pairing interaction, the instability produces a thermal transition to a superconducting phase, which is distinct from the traditional state described by Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) theory, as evidenced by a gap-to-transition temperature ratio exceeding the universal BCS limit. The elementary excitations of this superconductor are not Bogoliubov quasiparticles but rather superpositions of doublons and holons, composite excitations that show that the superconducting ground state of the doped Mott insulator inherits the non-Fermi liquid character of the normal state. An unexpected feature of this model is that it exhibits a superconductivity-induced transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies, as seen in the cuprates, as well as a suppression of the superfluid density relative to that in BCS theory.</p>",[],False,"[""Philip W.

letter,Fragility of time-reversal symmetry protected topological phases,"<p>The second law of thermodynamics points to the existence of an &#8216;arrow of time&#8217;, along which entropy only increases. This arises despite the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) of the microscopic laws of nature. Within quantum theory, TRS underpins many interesting phenomena, most notably topological insulators and the Haldane phase of quantum magnets. Here, we demonstrate that such TRS-protected effects are fundamentally unstable against coupling to an environment. Irrespective of the microscopic symmetries, interactions between a quantum system and its surroundings facilitate processes that would be forbidden by TRS in an isolated system. This leads not only to entanglement entropy production and the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility, but also to the demise of TRS-protected phenomena, including those associated with certain symmetry-protected topological phases. Our results highlight the enigmatic nature of TRS in quantum mechanics and elucidate potential challenges in utilizing topological systems for quantum technologies.</p>",[],False,"[""Max McGinley"", ""Nigel R.

letter,Efficient learning of quantum noise,"<p>Noise is the central obstacle to building large-scale quantum computers. Quantum systems with sufficiently uncorrelated and weak noise could be used to solve computational problems that are intractable with current digital computers. There has been substantial progress towards engineering such systems. However, continued progress depends on the ability to characterize quantum noise reliably and efficiently with high precision. Here, we describe such a protocol and report its experimental implementation on a 14-qubit superconducting quantum architecture. The method returns an estimate of the effective noise and can detect correlations within arbitrary sets of qubits. We show how to construct a quantum noise correlation matrix allowing the easy visualization of correlations between all pairs of qubits, enabling the discovery of long-range two-qubit correlations in the 14-qubit device that had not previously been detected. Our results are the first implementation of a provably rigorous and comprehensive diagnostic protocol capable of being run on state-of-the-art devices and beyond. These results pave the way for noise metrology in next-generation quantum devices, calibration in the presence of crosstalk, bespoke quantum error-correcting codes and customized fault-tolerance protocols that can greatly reduce the overhead in a quantum computation.</p>",[],False,"[""Robin Harper"", ""Steven T.

letter,Suppression of superconductivity by anisotropic strain near a nematic quantum critical point,"<p>In most unconventional and high-temperature superconductors, superconductivity emerges as a nearby symmetry-breaking phase is suppressed by chemical doping or pressure. This has led to the belief that the fluctuations associated with the symmetry-breaking phase are beneficial, if not responsible, for the superconducting pairing. A direct test to verify this hypothesis is to observe a decrease of the superconducting critical temperature (T<sub>c</sub>) by applying the symmetry-breaking conjugate field that suppresses the dynamic fluctuations of the competing order. However, most of the competing phases in unconventional superconductors break translational symmetry, requiring a spatially modulated conjugate field that is difficult to realize experimentally. Here, we show that anisotropic strain, the conjugate field of nematicity, reduces the T<sub>c</sub> of an iron pnictide. For optimally doped samples we show a fivefold reduction of T<sub>c</sub> with less than one per cent of strain. For underdoped samples, T<sub>c</sub> becomes zero yielding a fully metallic ground state. In addition to providing direct evidence of the role played by the nematic fluctuations in the formation of the superconducting state, these results demonstrate tunable mechanical control of a high-temperature superconductor, an important step forward for technological applications of superconductivity.</p>",[],False,"[""Paul Malinowski"", ""Qianni Jiang"", ""Joshua J.

letter,Unconventional free charge in the correlated semimetal Nd2Ir2O7,"<p>Nd<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is a correlated semimetal with the pyrochlore structure, in which competing spin&#8211;orbit coupling and electron&#8211;electron interactions are believed to induce a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal phase characterized by pairs of topologically protected Dirac points at the Fermi energy. However, the emergent properties in these materials are far from clear, and exotic new states of matter have been conjectured. Here, we demonstrate optically that, at low temperatures, the free carrier spectral weight is proportional to T<sup>2</sup>, where T is the temperature, as expected for massless Dirac electrons. However, we do not observe the corresponding T<sup>3</sup> term in the specific heat. That the system is not in a Fermi liquid state is further corroborated by the charge carrier scattering rate approaching critical damping and the progressive opening of a correlation-induced gap at low temperatures. These observations cannot be reconciled within the framework of band theory of electron-like quasiparticles and point towards the effective decoupling of the charge transport from the single particle sector.</p>",[],False,"[""K.

article,A strong no-go theorem on the Wigner's friend paradox,"<p>Does quantum theory apply at all scales, including that of observers? New light on this fundamental question has recently been shed through a resurgence of interest in the long-standing Wigner&#8217;s friend paradox. This is a thought experiment addressing the quantum measurement problem&#8212;the difficulty of reconciling the (unitary, deterministic) evolution of isolated systems and the (non-unitary, probabilistic) state update after a measurement. Here, by building on a scenario with two separated but entangled friends introduced by Brukner, we prove that if quantum evolution is controllable on the scale of an observer, then one of &#8216;No-Superdeterminism&#8217;, &#8216;Locality&#8217; or &#8216;Absoluteness of Observed Events&#8217;&#8212;that every observed event exists absolutely, not relatively&#8212;must be false. We show that although the violation of Bell-type inequalities in such scenarios is not in general sufficient to demonstrate the contradiction between those three assumptions, new inequalities can be derived, in a theory-independent manner, that are violated by quantum correlations. This is demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment where a photon&#8217;s path is deemed an observer.

article,Weak-to-strong transition of quantum measurement in a trapped-ion system,"<p>Quantum measurement remains a puzzle through its stormy history from the birth of quantum mechanics to state-of-the-art quantum technologies. Two complementary measurement schemes have been widely investigated in a variety of quantum systems: von Neumann&#8217;s projective &#8216;strong&#8217; measurement and Aharonov&#8217;s weak measurement. Here, we report the observation of a weak-to-strong measurement transition in a single trapped <sup>40</sup>Ca<sup>+</sup> ion system. The transition is realized by tuning the interaction strength between the ion&#8217;s internal electronic state and its vibrational motion, which play the roles of the measured system and the measuring pointer, respectively. By pre- and post-selecting the internal state, a pointer state composed of two of the ion&#8217;s motional wavepackets is obtained, and its central-position shift, which corresponds to the measurement outcome, demonstrates the transition from the weak-value asymptotes to the expectation-value asymptotes. Quantitatively, the weak-to-strong measurement transition is characterized by a universal transition factor \({e}^{-{\varGamma }^{2}/2}\), where &#915; is a dimensionless parameter related to the system&#8211;apparatus coupling. This transition, which continuously connects weak measurements and strong measurements, may open new experimental possibilities to test quantum foundations and prompt us to re-examine and improve the measurement schemes of related quantum technologies.</p>",[],False,"[""Yiming Pan"", ""Jie Zhang"", ""Eliahu Cohen"", ""Chun-wang Wu"", ""Ping-Xing Chen"", ""Nir Davidson""]","Pan, Y., Zhang, J., Cohen, E. et al.

article,Time–information uncertainty relations in thermodynamics,"<p>Physical systems powering motion and creating structure in a fixed amount of time dissipate energy and produce entropy. Whether living, synthetic or engineered, systems performing these dynamic functions must balance dissipation and speed. Here, we show that rates of energy and entropy exchange are subject to a speed limit&#8212;a time&#8211;information uncertainty relation&#8212;imposed by the rates of change in the information content of the system. This uncertainty relation bounds the time that elapses before the change in a thermodynamic quantity has the same magnitude as its s.d. From this general bound, we establish a family of speed limits for heat, dissipated/chemical work and entropy depending on the experimental constraints on the system and its environment. In all of these inequalities, the timescale of transient dynamical fluctuations is universally bounded by the Fisher information. Moreover, they all have a mathematical form that mirrors the Mandelstam&#8211;Tamm version of the time&#8211;energy uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics. These bounds on the speed of arbitrary observables apply to transient systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium, independent of the physical constraints on the stochastic dynamics or their function.</p>",[],False,"[""Schuyler B.

article,Thermodynamics of a deeply degenerate SU(N)-symmetric Fermi gas,"<p>Many-body quantum systems can exhibit a striking degree of symmetry unparallelled in their classical counterparts.

Here, we study an SU(N)-symmetric Fermi liquid of <sup>87</sup>Sr atoms, where N can be tuned to be as large as 10. In the deeply degenerate regime, we show through precise measurements of density fluctuations and expansion dynamics that the large N of spin states under SU(N) symmetry leads to pronounced interaction effects in a system with a nominally negligible interaction parameter. Accounting for these effects, we demonstrate thermometry accurate to 1% of the Fermi energy.

It is a surprising fact that they often obey the so-called scaling laws that relate an observable quantity to a measure of the size of the system. Here, we describe the discovery of universal superlinear metabolic scaling laws in human cancers. This dependence underpins increasing tumour aggressiveness, owing to evolutionary dynamics, that leads to an explosive growth as the disease progresses. We validated this dynamic using longitudinal volumetric data of different histologies from large cohorts of patients with cancer. To explain our observations we tested complex, biologically inspired mathematical models that describe the key processes that govern tumour growth. Our models predict that the emergence of superlinear allometric scaling laws is an inherently three-dimensional phenomenon.
