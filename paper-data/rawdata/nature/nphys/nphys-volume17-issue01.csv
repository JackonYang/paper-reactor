letter,Direct observation of two-dimensional magnons in atomically thin CrI3,"<p>Magnons are collective spin excitations in crystals with long-range magnetic order. The emergent van der Waals magnets provide a highly tunable platform to explore magnetic excitations in the two-dimensional limit with intriguing properties, manifesting from their honeycomb lattice structure and switchable magnetic configurations. Here, we report the direct observation of two-dimensional magnons through magneto-Raman spectroscopy with optical selection rules determined by the interplay between crystal symmetry, layer number and magnetic states in atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. In monolayers, we observe an acoustic magnon mode at ~0.3&#8201;meV. It has strict cross-circularly polarized selection rules locked to the magnetization direction that originates from the conservation of angular momentum of photons and magnons dictated by three-fold rotational symmetry. Additionally, we reveal optical magnon modes at ~17&#8201;meV. This mode is Raman silent in monolayers, but optically active in bilayers and bulk due to a relaxation of the parity criterion resulting from the layer index. In the layered antiferromagnetic states, we directly resolve two degenerate optical magnon modes with opposite angular momentum and conjugate optical selection rules. From these measurements, we quantitatively extract the spin-wave gap, magnetic anisotropy and intralayer and interlayer exchange constants, and establish two-dimensional magnets as a new platform for exploring magnon physics.</p>",[],False,"[""John Cenker"", ""Bevin Huang"", ""Nishchay Suri"", ""Pearl Thijssen"", ""Aaron Miller"", ""Tiancheng Song"", ""Takashi Taniguchi"", ""Kenji Watanabe"", ""Michael A.

letter,Symmetry breaking in twisted double bilayer graphene,"<p>The flat bands that appear in some twisted van der Waals heterostructures provide a setting in which strong interactions between electrons lead to a variety of correlated phases. In particular, heterostructures of twisted double bilayer graphene host correlated insulating states that can be tuned by both the twist angle and an external electric field. Here, we report electrical transport measurements of twisted double bilayer graphene with which we examine the fundamental role of spontaneous symmetry breaking in its phase diagram. The metallic states near each of the correlated insulators exhibit abrupt drops in their resistivity as the temperature is lowered, along with associated nonlinear current&#8211;voltage characteristics. Despite qualitative similarities to superconductivity, the simultaneous reversals in the sign of the Hall coefficient point instead to spontaneous symmetry breaking as the origin of the abrupt resistivity drops, whereas Joule heating seems to underlie the nonlinear transport. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are probably relevant across a broader class of semiconducting flat band van der Waals heterostructures.</p>",[],False,"[""Minhao He"", ""Yuhao Li"", ""Jiaqi Cai"", ""Yang Liu"", ""K.

letter,Excitons bound by photon exchange,"<p>In contrast to interband excitons in undoped quantum wells, doped quantum wells do not display sharp resonances due to excitonic bound states. The effective Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes in these systems typically leads to only a depolarization shift of the single-electron intersubband transitions. Non-perturbative light&#8211;matter interaction in solid-state devices has been investigated as a pathway to tuning optoelectronic properties of materials. A recent theoretical work predicted that when the doped quantum wells are embedded in a photonic cavity, emission&#8211;reabsorption processes of cavity photons can generate an effective attractive interaction that binds electrons and holes together, leading to the creation of an intraband bound exciton. Here, we spectroscopically observe such a bound state as a discrete resonance that appears below the ionization threshold only when the coupling between light and matter is increased above a critical value. Our result demonstrates that two charged particles can be bound by the exchange of transverse photons. Light&#8211;matter coupling can thus be used as a tool in quantum material engineering, tuning electronic properties of semiconductor heterostructures beyond those permitted by mere crystal structures, with direct applications to mid-infrared optoelectronics.</p>",[],False,"[""Erika Cortese"", ""Ngoc-Linh Tran"", ""Jean-Michel Manceau"", ""Adel Bousseksou"", ""Iacopo Carusotto"", ""Giorgio Biasiol"", ""Raffaele Colombelli"", ""Simone De Liberato""]","Cortese, E., Tran, NL., Manceau, JM. et al.

letter,High-temperature quantum anomalous Hall regime in a MnBi2Te4/Bi2Te3 superlattice,"<p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect is a fundamental transport response of a topological insulator in zero magnetic field. Its physical origin is a result of an intrinsically inverted electronic band structure and ferromagnetism, and its most important manifestation is the dissipationless flow of chiral charge currents at the edges of the system, a property that has the potential to transform future quantum electronics. Here, we report a Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall regime at temperatures of several Kelvin in the magnetic topological bulk crystals in which Mn ions self-organize into a period-ordered MnBi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>4</sub>/Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> superlattice. Robust ferromagnetism of the MnBi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>4</sub> monolayers opens a surface gap, and when the Fermi level is tuned to be within this gap, the anomalous Hall conductance reaches an e<sup>2</sup>/h quantization plateau, which is a clear indication of chiral transport through the edge states.

letter,Zero-bias peaks at zero magnetic field in ferromagnetic hybrid nanowires,"<p>Hybrid quantum materials allow for quantum phases that otherwise do not exist in nature. For example, a one-dimensional topological superconductor with Majorana states bound to its ends can be realized by coupling a semiconductor nanowire to a superconductor in the presence of a strong magnetic field. However, the applied magnetic fields are detrimental to superconductivity, and constrain device layout, components, materials, fabrication and operation. Early on, an alternative source of Zeeman coupling that circumvents these constraints&#8212;using a ferromagnetic insulator instead of an applied field&#8212;was proposed theoretically. Here, we report transport measurements in hybrid nanowires using epitaxial layers of superconducting Al and the ferromagnetic insulator EuS on semiconducting InAs nanowires. We infer a remanent effective Zeeman field exceeding 1&#8201;T and observe stable zero-bias conductance peaks in bias spectroscopy at zero applied field, consistent with topological superconductivity.

letter,Bloch ferromagnetism of composite fermions,"<p>In 1929, Felix Bloch suggested that the paramagnetic Fermi sea of electrons should make a spontaneous transition to a fully magnetized state at very low densities, because the exchange energy gained by aligning the spins exceeds the enhancement in the kinetic energy. However, experimental realizations of this effect have been hard to implement. Here, we report the observation of an abrupt, interaction-driven transition to full magnetization, highly reminiscent of Bloch ferromagnetism. Our platform utilizes the two-dimensional Fermi sea of composite fermions near half-filling of the lowest Landau level. We measure the Fermi wavevector&#8212;which directly provides the spin polarization&#8212;and observe a sudden transition from a partially spin-polarized to a fully spin-polarized ground state as we lower the density of the composite fermions.

letter,Spectroscopic fingerprint of charge order melting driven by quantum fluctuations in a cuprate,"<p>Copper oxide high-T<sub>C</sub> superconductors possess a number of exotic orders that coexist with or are proximal to superconductivity. Quantum fluctuations associated with these orders may account for the unusual characteristics of the normal state, and possibly affect the superconductivity. Yet, spectroscopic evidence for such quantum fluctuations remains elusive. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to reveal spectroscopic evidence of fluctuations associated with a charge order in nearly optimally doped Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+&#948;</sub>. In the superconducting state, while the quasielastic charge order signal decreases with temperature, the interplay between charge order fluctuations and bond-stretching phonons in the form of a Fano-like interference increases, an observation that is incompatible with expectations for competing orders. Invoking general principles, we argue that this behaviour reflects the properties of a dissipative system near an order&#8211;disorder quantum critical point, where the dissipation varies with the opening of the pseudogap and superconducting gap at low temperatures, leading to the proliferation of quantum critical fluctuations, which melt charge order.</p>",[],False,"[""W.

letter,Superconductivity and quantum criticality linked by the Hall effect in a strange metal,"<p>Many unconventional superconductors exhibit a common set of anomalous charge transport properties that characterize them as &#8216;strange metals&#8217;, which provides hope that there is a single theory that describes them. However, model-independent connections between the strange metals and superconductivity have remained elusive. Here, we show that the Hall effect of the unconventional superconductor BaFe<sub>2</sub>(As<sub>1&#8722;x</sub>P<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub> contains an anomalous contribution arising from the correlations within the strange metal. This term has a distinctive dependence on the magnetic field, which allows us to track its behaviour across the doping&#8211;temperature phase diagram, even under the superconducting dome. These measurements demonstrate that the strange metal Hall component emanates from a quantum critical point and, in the zero-temperature limit, decays together with the superconducting critical temperature. This empirically reveals the structure of the connection between superconductivity and quantum criticality, which may be common to the physics of many strange metal superconductors.</p>",[],False,"[""Ian M.

letter,Black metal hydrogen above 360 GPa driven by proton quantum fluctuations,"<p>Hydrogen metallization under stable conditions is a substantial step towards the realization of the first room-temperature superconductor. Recent low-temperature experiments report different metallization pressures, ranging from 360&#8201;GPa to 490&#8201;GPa. In this work, we simulate the structural properties and vibrational Raman, infrared and optical spectra of hydrogen phase III, accounting for proton quantum effects. We demonstrate that nuclear quantum fluctuations downshift the vibron frequencies by 25%, introduce a broad lineshape into the Raman spectra and reduce the optical gap by 3&#8201;eV. We show that hydrogen metallization occurs at 380&#8201;GPa in phase III due to band overlap, in good agreement with transport data. Our simulations predict that this state is a black metal&#8212;transparent in the infrared&#8212;so the shiny metal observed at 490&#8201;GPa (ref. ) is not phase III. We predict that the conductivity onset and optical gap will substantially increase if hydrogen is replaced by deuterium, underlining that metallization is driven by quantum fluctuations and is thus isotope-dependent. We show how hydrogen acquires conductivity and brightness at different pressures, explaining the apparent contradictions in existing experimental scenarios.</p>",[],False,"[""Lorenzo Monacelli"", ""Ion Errea"", ""Matteo Calandra"", ""Francesco Mauri""]","Monacelli, L., Errea, I., Calandra, M. et al.

letter,Chemotaxis under flow disorder shapes microbial dispersion in porous media,"<p>Natural soils are host to a high density and diversity of microorganisms, and even deep-earth porous rocks provide a habitat for active microbial communities. In these environments, microbial transport by disordered flows is relevant for a broad range of natural and engineered processes, from biochemical cycling to remineralization and bioremediation. Yet, how bacteria are transported and distributed in the subsurface as a result of the disordered flow and the associated chemical gradients characteristic of porous media has remained poorly understood, in part because studies have so far focused on steady, macroscale chemical gradients. Here, we use a microfluidic model system that captures flow disorder and chemical gradients at the pore scale to quantify the transport and dispersion of the soil-dwelling bacterium Bacillus subtilis in porous media. We observe that chemotaxis strongly modulates the persistence of bacteria in low-flow regions of the pore space, resulting in a 100% increase in their dispersion coefficient. This effect stems directly from the strong pore-scale gradients created by flow disorder and demonstrates that the microscale interplay between bacterial behaviour and pore-scale disorder can impact the macroscale dynamics of biota in the subsurface.</p>",[],False,"[""Pietro de Anna"", ""Amir A.

article,Underground test of gravity-related wave function collapse,"<p>Roger Penrose proposed that a spatial quantum superposition collapses as a back-reaction from spacetime, which is curved in different ways by each branch of the superposition. In this sense, one speaks of gravity-related wave function collapse. He also provided a heuristic formula to compute the decay time of the superposition&#8212;similar to that suggested earlier by Lajos Di&#243;si, hence the name Di&#243;si&#8211;Penrose model. The collapse depends on the effective size of the mass density of particles in the superposition, and is random: this randomness shows up as a diffusion of the particles&#8217; motion, resulting, if charged, in the emission of radiation. Here, we compute the radiation emission rate, which is faint but detectable. We then report the results of a dedicated experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory to measure this radiation emission rate. Our result sets a lower bound on the effective size of the mass density of nuclei, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than previous bounds.

article,Search for axion-like dark matter with ferromagnets,"<p>Ultralight axion-like particles are well-motivated dark matter candidates, naturally emerging from theories of physics at ultrahigh energies. Here we report the results of a direct search for electromagnetic interactions of axion-like dark matter in the mass range that spans three decades from 12&#8201;peV to 12&#8201;neV. The detection scheme is based on a modification of Maxwell&#8217;s equations in the presence of axion-like dark matter that mixes with a static magnetic field to produce an oscillating magnetic field. The experiment makes use of toroidal magnets with ferromagnetic powder cores made of an iron&#8211;nickel alloy, which enhance the static magnetic field by a factor of 24. Using superconducting quantum interference devices, we achieve magnetic sensitivity of 150&#8201;\(\mathrm{aT}\, {\mathrm{Hz}}^{-1/2}\), which is at the level of the most sensitive magnetic field measurements demonstrated with any broadband sensor. We recorded 41&#8201;h of data and improved the best limits on the magnitude of electromagnetic coupling constant for axion-like dark matter over a part of our mass range, at 20&#8201;peV reaching 4.0&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>&#8722;11</sup>&#8201;GeV<sup>&#8722;1</sup> (95% confidence level).

article,Photon-pressure strong coupling between two superconducting circuits,"<p>The radiation-pressure coupling between two harmonic oscillators has been used in optomechanics for breakthrough experiments in the control and detection of mechanical displacement. Used primarily in optomechanics, there have been few reports of exploiting such a type of interaction in other platforms. Here, we engineer two superconducting LC circuits coupled by a strong photon-pressure interaction, a term we use in analogy to the radiation-pressure interaction between light and mechanical objects. The coupling arises from a change in the resonant frequency of one circuit in response to the current flowing in the second. We observe dynamical backaction between the two circuits, photon-pressure-induced transparency and absorption, and enter the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we observe parametrically amplified thermal current fluctuations in a radiofrequency circuit close to its quantum ground state. Owing to the high design flexibility of superconducting circuits, our approach will enable new experiments with radiofrequency photons and parameter regimes of photon-pressure coupling that are not accessible in other platforms.</p>",[],False,"[""D.

article,Strong coupling and pressure engineering in WSe2–MoSe2 heterobilayers,"<p>Two-dimensional materials offer an exciting platform that enables the creation of van der Waals heterostructures with rich functions and intriguing physical properties that stem from different band alignments and diverse interlayer interactions. However, further exploration of two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures is hindered by the limited coupling strength and lack of efficient methods for tuning the interlayer interactions. Here, by using a two-step chemical vapour deposition method, we realize high-quality 2H-stacked WSe<sub>2</sub>&#8211;MoSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures with strong interlayer coupling, and effective tuning of their interlayer interaction by hydrostatic pressure. We unambiguously establish the strong coupling nature in these WSe<sub>2</sub>&#8211;MoSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures through the existence of exclusive interlayer excitons instead of the typical intralayer excitons. We further demonstrate efficient tuning of the interlayer coupling by using pressure engineering, and observe a clear evolution and transition of interlayer excitons in WSe<sub>2</sub>&#8211;MoSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures with a pressure-induced band changeover, which is further confirmed by first-principles calculations.

article,Generalized superradiance for producing broadband coherent radiation with transversely modulated arbitrarily diluted bunches,"<p>Superradiance is the anomalous radiance describing coherent photon emission from a gas. It plays a crucial role in atomic physics, quantum mechanics and astrophysics. Because the intensity of superradiant light beams is proportional to the number of particles squared, superradiance is also at the core of today&#8217;s most powerful light sources. Superradiant emission is intuitively expected when the distance between light-emitting particles is much smaller than the photon wavelength. Here, we break this assumption by predicting a never considered superradiance effect that holds even when the particle number per wavelength vanishes. We discover that a bunch of relativistic charged particles arranged in certain ways can generate an optical shock along the Vavilov&#8211;Cherenkov angle in vacuum, thereby concentrating broadband radiation in any spectral region into single light bullets. The process leaves clear experimental signatures, and we illustrate it in the form of a previously unrecognized nonlinear superradiant Thomson scattering. This concept may enable new forms of superradiant emission in advanced light sources, atomic physics systems, and unlock coherent emission in plasma accelerators.</p>",[],False,"[""J. Vieira"", ""M.

article,Structure determines where crystallization occurs in a soft colloidal glass,"<p>Glass is inherently unstable to crystallization. However, how this transformation occurs while the dynamics in the glass stay frozen at the particle scale is poorly understood. Here, through single-particle-resolved imaging experiments, we show that due to frozen-in density inhomogeneities, a soft colloidal glass crystallizes via two distinct pathways. In the poorly packed regions of the glass, crystallinity grew smoothly due to local particle shuffles, whereas in the well-packed regions, we observed abrupt jumps in crystallinity that were triggered by avalanches&#8212;cooperative rearrangements involving many tens of particles. Importantly, we show that softness&#8212;a structural-order parameter determined through machine-learning methods&#8212;not only predicts where crystallization initiates in a glass but is also sensitive to the crystallization pathway. Such a causal connection between the structure and stability of a glass has so far remained elusive.

article,Morphology selection kinetics of crystallization in a sphere,"<p>Crystallization under geometrical confinement is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics, biophysics and material science. Even the influence of the simplest geometry, a sphere, on crystallization remains far from well understood, thereby making morphology control of the final superstructures challenging. Here, we employ charged colloids encapsulated in an emulsion droplet as a model system to access the crystallization kinetics at the single-particle level. We find rapid formation of &#8216;skin&#8217; layers with an icosahedral arrangement of defects under the geometrical frustration effect, followed by interior ordering and slow ripening. The final morphologies are determined by dynamical interplay between the system-independent skin layer formation and the system-dependent structural transformation towards the most stable solid far from the surface. We reveal the crucial role of kinetics in morphological selection under a geometrical constraint, besides the thermodynamics, which may shed new light on the structural design of nanoscale crystals.</p>",[],False,"[""Yanshuang Chen"", ""Zhenwei Yao"", ""Shixiang Tang"", ""Hua Tong"", ""Taiki Yanagishima"", ""Hajime Tanaka"", ""Peng Tan""]","Chen, Y., Yao, Z., Tang, S. et al.

Here we show by experiments and simulations that a binary mixture of hard-sphere-like nanoparticles crystallizing into a MgZn<sub>2</sub> Laves phase in bulk spontaneously forms icosahedral clusters in slowly drying droplets. Using advanced electron tomography, we are able to obtain the real-space coordinates of all the spheres in the icosahedral clusters of up to about 10,000 particles. The local structure of 70&#8211;80% of the particles became similar to that of the MgCu<sub>2</sub> Laves phase. These observations are important for photonic applications. In addition, we observed in simulations that the icosahedral clusters nucleated away from the spherical boundary, which is distinctly different from that of the single species clusters.

article,Controlling the speed and trajectory of evolution with counterdiabatic driving,"<p>The pace and unpredictability of evolution are critically relevant in a variety of modern challenges, such as combating drug resistance in pathogens and cancer, understanding how species respond to environmental perturbations like climate change and developing artificial selection approaches for agriculture. Great progress has been made in quantitative modelling of evolution using fitness landscapes, allowing a degree of prediction for future evolutionary histories. Yet fine-grained control of the speed and distributions of these trajectories remains elusive. We propose an approach to achieve this using ideas originally developed in a completely different context&#8212;counterdiabatic driving to control the behaviour of quantum states for applications like quantum computing and manipulating ultracold atoms. Implementing these ideas for the first time in a biological context, we show how a set of external control parameters (that is, varying drug concentrations and types, temperature and nutrients) can guide the probability distribution of genotypes in a population along a specified path and time interval. This level of control, allowing empirical optimization of evolutionary speed and trajectories, has myriad potential applications, from enhancing adaptive therapies for diseases to the development of thermotolerant crops in preparation for climate change, to accelerating bioengineering methods built on evolutionary models, like directed evolution of biomolecules.</p>",[],False,"[""Shamreen Iram"", ""Emily Dolson"", ""Joshua Chiel"", ""Julia Pelesko"", ""Nikhil Krishnan"", ""\u00d6zen\u00e7 G\u00fcng\u00f6r"", ""Benjamin Kuznets-Speck"", ""Sebastian Deffner"", ""Efe Ilker"", ""Jacob G.
