review article,Moiré heterostructures as a condensed-matter quantum simulator,"<p>Twisted van der Waals heterostructures have latterly received prominent attention for their many remarkable experimental properties and the promise that they hold for realizing elusive states of matter in the laboratory. We propose that these systems can, in fact, be used as a robust quantum simulation platform that enables the study of strongly correlated physics and topology in quantum materials. Among the features that make these materials a versatile toolbox are the tunability of their properties through readily accessible external parameters such as gating, straining, packing and twist angle; the feasibility to realize and control a large number of fundamental many-body quantum models relevant in the field of condensed-matter physics; and finally, the availability of experimental readout protocols that directly map their rich phase diagrams in and out of equilibrium. This general framework makes it possible to robustly realize and functionalize new phases of matter in a modular fashion, thus broadening the landscape of accessible physics and holding promise for future technological applications.</p>",[],False,"[""Dante M.

letter,Ultrafast manipulation of the weakly bound helium dimer,"<p>Controlling the interactions between atoms with external fields opened up new branches in physics ranging from strongly correlated atomic systems to ideal Bose and Fermi gases and Efimov physics. Such control usually prepares samples that are stationary or evolve adiabatically in time. In contrast, in molecular physics, external ultrashort laser fields are used to create anisotropic potentials that launch ultrafast rotational wave packets and align molecules in free space. Here we combine these two regimes of ultrafast times and low energies. We apply a short laser pulse to the helium dimer, a weakly bound and highly delocalized single bound state quantum system. The laser field locally tunes the interaction between two helium atoms, imparting an angular momentum of 2&#8463; and evoking an initially confined dissociative wave packet. We record a video of the density and phase of this wave packet as it propagates from small to large internuclear distances. At large internuclear distances, where the interaction between atoms is negligible, the wave packet is essentially free. This work paves the way for future tomography of wave-packet dynamics and provides the technique for studying exotic and otherwise hardly accessible quantum systems, such as halo and Efimov states.</p>",[],False,"[""Maksim Kunitski"", ""Qingze Guan"", ""Holger Maschkiwitz"", ""J\u00f6rg Hahnenbruch"", ""Sebastian Eckart"", ""Stefan Zeller"", ""Anton Kalinin"", ""Markus Sch\u00f6ffler"", ""Lothar Ph.

letter,The Heisenberg limit for laser coherence,"<p>Quantum optical coherence can be quantified only by accounting for both the particle- and wave-nature of light. For an ideal laser beam, the coherence can be thought of roughly as the number of photons emitted consecutively into the beam with the same phase. This number, \({\mathfrak{C}}\), can be much larger than the number of photons in the laser itself, &#956;. The limit for an ideal laser was thought to be of order &#956;<sup>2</sup> (refs. ). Here, assuming only that a laser produces a beam with properties close to those of an ideal laser beam and that it has no external sources of coherence, we derive an upper bound on \({\mathfrak{C}}\), which is of order &#956;<sup>4</sup>. Moreover, using the matrix product states method, we find a model that achieves this scaling and show that it could, in principle, be realized using circuit quantum electrodynamics. Thus, \({\mathfrak{C}}\) of order &#956;<sup>2</sup> is only a standard quantum limit; the ultimate quantum limit&#8212;or Heisenberg limit&#8212;is quadratically better.</p>",[],False,"[""Travis J.

letter,Visualization of the flat electronic band in twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle twist,"<p>Bilayer graphene has been predicted to host a moir&#233; miniband with flat dispersion if the layers are stacked at specific twist angles known as the &#8217;magic angles&#8217;. Recently, twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) with a magic angle twist was reported to exhibit a correlated insulating state and superconductivity, where the presence of the flat miniband in the system is thought to be essential for the emergence of these ordered phases in the transport measurements. Although tunnelling spectroscopy and electronic compressibility measurements in tBLG have found a van Hove singularity that is consistent with the presence of the flat miniband, a direct observation of the flat dispersion in the momentum space of such a moir&#233; miniband in tBLG is still lacking. Here, we report the visualization of this flat moir&#233; miniband by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with nanoscale resolution. The high spatial resolution of this technique enabled the measurement of the local electronic structure of the tBLG.

letter,Observation of flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene,"<p>Transport experiments in twisted bilayer graphene have revealed multiple superconducting domes separated by correlated insulating states. These properties are generally associated with strongly correlated states in a flat mini-band of the hexagonal moir&#233; superlattice as was predicted by band structure calculations. Evidence for the existence of a flat band comes from local tunnelling spectroscopy and electronic compressibility measurements, which report two or more sharp peaks in the density of states that may be associated with closely spaced Van Hove singularities. However, direct momentum-resolved measurements have proved to be challenging. Here, we combine different imaging techniques and angle-resolved photoemission with simultaneous real- and momentum-space resolution (nano-ARPES) to directly map the band dispersion in twisted bilayer graphene devices near charge neutrality. Our experiments reveal large areas with a homogeneous twist angle that support a flat band with a spectral weight that is highly localized in momentum space. The flat band is separated from the dispersive Dirac bands, which show multiple moir&#233; hybridization gaps. These data establish the salient features of the twisted bilayer graphene band structure.</p>",[],False,"[""Simone Lisi"", ""Xiaobo Lu"", ""Tjerk Benschop"", ""Tobias A. de Jong"", ""Petr Stepanov"", ""Jose R.

letter,Ultrasound evidence for a two-component superconducting order parameter in Sr2RuO4,"<p>The quasi-two-dimensional metal Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> is one of the best characterized unconventional superconductors, yet the nature of its superconducting order parameter is still under debate. This information is crucial to determine the pairing mechanism of Cooper pairs. Here we use ultrasound velocity to probe the superconducting state of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>. This thermodynamic probe is sensitive to the symmetry of the material, and therefore, it can help in identifying the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. Indeed, we observe a sharp jump in the shear elastic constant c<sub>66</sub> as the temperature is increased across the superconducting transition. This directly implies that the superconducting order parameter is of a two-component nature. On the basis of symmetry arguments and given the other known properties of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> (refs. ), we discuss which states are compatible with this requirement and propose that the two-component order parameter {d<sub>xz</sub>; d<sub>yz</sub>} is the most likely candidate.</p>",[],False,"[""S.

letter,Thermodynamic evidence for a two-component superconducting order parameter in Sr2RuO4,"<p>Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> has stood as the leading candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor for 26 years. However, recent NMR experiments have cast doubt on this candidacy and it is difficult to find a theory of superconductivity that is consistent with all experiments. The order parameter symmetry for this material therefore remains an open question. Symmetry-based experiments are needed that can rule out broad classes of possible superconducting order parameters. Here, we use resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to measure the entire symmetry-resolved elastic tensor of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> through the superconducting transition. We observe a thermodynamic discontinuity in the shear elastic modulus c<sub>66</sub>, which implies that the superconducting order parameter has two components. A two-component p-wave order parameter, such as p<sub>x</sub>&#8201;+&#8201;ip<sub>y</sub>, naturally satisfies this requirement. As this order parameter appears to have been precluded by recent NMR experiments, we suggest that two other two-component order parameters, namely \(\{{d}_{xz},{d}_{yz}\}\) and \(\{{d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}},{g}_{xy({x}^{2}-{y}^{2})}\}\), are now the prime candidates for the order parameter of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>.</p>",[],False,"[""Sayak Ghosh"", ""Arkady Shekhter"", ""F.

letter,Bacteria solve the problem of crowding by moving slowly,"<p>Bacteria commonly live attached to surfaces in dense collectives containing billions of cells. While it is known that motility allows these groups to expand en masse into new territory, how bacteria collectively move across surfaces under such tightly packed conditions remains poorly understood. Here we combine experiments, cell tracking and individual-based modelling to study the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as it collectively migrates across surfaces using grappling-hook-like pili. We show that the fast-moving cells of a hyperpilated mutant are overtaken and outcompeted by the slower-moving wild type at high cell densities. Using theory developed to study liquid crystals, we demonstrate that this effect is mediated by the physics of topological defects, points where cells with different orientations meet one another. Our analyses reveal that when defects with topological charge +1/2 collide with one another, the fast-moving mutant cells rotate to point vertically and become trapped. By moving more slowly, wild-type cells avoid this trapping mechanism and generate collective behaviour that results in faster migration. In this way, the physics of liquid crystals explains how slow bacteria can outcompete faster cells in the race for new territory.</p>",[],False,"[""O. J. Meacock"", ""A. Doostmohammadi"", ""K. R.

letter,Topological defects promote layer formation in Myxococcus xanthus colonies,"<p>The soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus lives in densely packed groups that form dynamic three-dimensional patterns in response to environmental changes, such as droplet-like fruiting bodies during starvation. The development of these multicellular structures begins with the sequential formation of cell layers in a process that is poorly understood. Here, using confocal three-dimensional imaging, we find that motile, rod-shaped M. xanthus cells are densely packed and aligned in each layer, forming an active nematic liquid crystal. Cell alignment is nearly perfect throughout the population except at point defects that carry half-integer topological charge. We observe that new cell layers preferentially form at the position of +1/2&#8201;defects, whereas holes preferentially open at &#8722;1/2&#8201;defects. To explain these findings, we model the bacterial colony as an extensile active nematic fluid with anisotropic friction. In agreement with our experimental measurements, this model predicts an influx of cells towards the +1/2&#8201;defects and an outflux of cells from the &#8722;1/2&#8201;defects. Our results suggest that cell motility and mechanical cell&#8211;cell interactions are sufficient to promote the formation of cell layers at topological defects, thereby seeding fruiting bodies in colonies of M. xanthus.</p>",[],False,"[""Katherine Copenhagen"", ""Ricard Alert"", ""Ned S.

We lack, however, the tools to distinguish physical networks with identical wiring but different geometrical layouts. To address this need, here we introduce the concept of network isotopy, representing different network layouts that can be transformed into one another without link crossings, and show that a single quantity, the graph linking number, captures the entangledness of a layout, defining distinct isotopy classes. We find that a network&#8217;s elastic energy depends linearly on the graph linking number, indicating that each local tangle offers an independent contribution to the total energy. This finding allows us to formulate a statistical model for the formation of tangles in physical networks.

article,Intercontinental comparison of optical atomic clocks through very long baseline interferometry,"<p>The comparison of distant atomic clocks is foundational to international timekeeping, global positioning and tests of fundamental physics. Optical-fibre links allow the most precise optical clocks to be compared, without degradation, over intracontinental distances up to thousands of kilometres, but intercontinental comparisons remain limited by the performance of satellite transfer techniques. Here we show that very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), although originally developed for radio astronomy and geodesy, can overcome this limit and compare remote clocks through the observation of extragalactic radio sources. We developed dedicated transportable VLBI stations that use broadband detection and demonstrate the comparison of two optical clocks located in Italy and Japan separated by 9,000&#8201;km.

article,Entanglement between distant macroscopic mechanical and spin systems,"<p>Entanglement is an essential property of multipartite quantum systems, characterized by the inseparability of quantum states of objects regardless of their spatial separation. Generation of entanglement between increasingly macroscopic and disparate systems is an ongoing effort in quantum science, as it enables hybrid quantum networks, quantum-enhanced sensing and probing of the fundamental limits of quantum theory. The disparity of hybrid systems and the vulnerability of quantum correlations have thus far hampered the generation of macroscopic hybrid entanglement. Here, we generate an entangled state between the motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator and a collective atomic spin oscillator, as witnessed by an Einstein&#8211;Podolsky&#8211;Rosen variance below the separability limit, 0.83 &#177; 0.02 &lt; 1. The mechanical oscillator is a millimetre-size dielectric membrane and the spin oscillator is an ensemble of 10<sup>9</sup> atoms in a magnetic field. Light propagating through the two spatially separated systems generates entanglement because the collective spin plays the role of an effective negative-mass reference frame and provides&#8212;under ideal circumstances&#8212;a back-action-free subspace; in the experiment, quantum back-action is suppressed by 4.6 dB.</p>",[],False,"[""Rodrigo A.

article,Observation of energy-resolved many-body localization,"<p>Many-body localization (MBL) describes a quantum phase where an isolated interacting system subject to sufficient disorder displays non-ergodic behaviour, evading thermal equilibrium that occurs under its own dynamics. Previously, the thermalization&#8211;MBL transition has been largely characterized with the growth of disorder. Here, we explore a new axis, reporting on an energy-resolved MBL transition using a 19-qubit programmable superconducting processor, which enables precise control and flexibility of both disorder strength and initial state preparation. We observe that the onset of localization occurs at different disorder strengths, with distinguishable energy scales, by measuring time-evolved observables and quantities related to many-body wave functions. Our results open avenues for the experimental exploration of many-body mobility edges in MBL systems, whose existence is widely debated due to the finiteness of the system size, and where exact simulations in classical computers become unfeasible.</p>",[],False,"[""Qiujiang Guo"", ""Chen Cheng"", ""Zheng-Hang Sun"", ""Zixuan Song"", ""Hekang Li"", ""Zhen Wang"", ""Wenhui Ren"", ""Hang Dong"", ""Dongning Zheng"", ""Yu-Ran Zhang"", ""Rubem Mondaini"", ""Heng Fan"", ""H.

article,Scale-invariant magnetic anisotropy in RuCl3 at high magnetic fields,"<p>In RuCl<sub>3</sub>, inelastic neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy reveal a continuum of non-spin-wave excitations that persists to high temperature, suggesting the presence of a spin liquid state on a honeycomb lattice. In the context of the Kitaev model, finite magnetic fields introduce interactions between the elementary excitations, and thus the effects of high magnetic fields that are comparable to the spin-exchange energy scale must be explored. Here, we report measurements of the magnetotropic coefficient&#8212;the thermodynamic coefficient associated with magnetic anisotropy&#8212;over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures. We find that magnetic field and temperature compete to determine the magnetic response in a way that is independent of the large intrinsic exchange-interaction energy. This emergent scale-invariant magnetic anisotropy provides evidence for a high degree of exchange frustration that favours the formation of a spin liquid state in RuCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>",[],False,"[""K.

article,Inertial spin dynamics in ferromagnets,"<p>The understanding of how spins move and can be manipulated at pico- and femtosecond timescales has implications for ultrafast and energy-efficient data-processing and storage applications. However, the possibility of realizing commercial technologies based on ultrafast spin dynamics has been hampered by our limited knowledge of the physics behind processes on this timescale. Recently, it has been suggested that inertial effects should be considered in the full description of the spin dynamics at these ultrafast timescales, but a clear observation of such effects in ferromagnets is still lacking. Here, we report direct experimental evidence of intrinsic inertial spin dynamics in ferromagnetic thin films in the form of a nutation of the magnetization at a frequency of ~0.5&#8201;THz. This allows us to reveal that the angular momentum relaxation time in ferromagnets is on the order of 10&#8201;ps.</p>",[],False,"[""Kumar Neeraj"", ""Nilesh Awari"", ""Sergey Kovalev"", ""Debanjan Polley"", ""Nanna Zhou Hagstr\u00f6m"", ""Sri Sai Phani Kanth Arekapudi"", ""Anna Semisalova"", ""Kilian Lenz"", ""Bertram Green"", ""Jan-Christoph Deinert"", ""Igor Ilyakov"", ""Min Chen"", ""Mohammed Bawatna"", ""Valentino Scalera"", ""Massimiliano d\u2019Aquino"", ""Claudio Serpico"", ""Olav Hellwig"", ""Jean-Eric Wegrowe"", ""Michael Gensch"", ""Stefano Bonetti""]","Neeraj, K., Awari, N., Kovalev, S. et al.

article,Topological defects in the nematic order of actin fibres as organization centres of Hydra morphogenesis,"<p>Animal morphogenesis arises from the complex interplay between multiple mechanical and biochemical processes with mutual feedback. Developing an effective, coarse-grained description of morphogenesis is essential for understanding how these processes are coordinated across scales to form robust, functional outcomes. Here we show that the nematic order of the supracellular actin fibres in regenerating Hydra defines a slowly varying field, whose dynamics provide an effective description of the morphogenesis process. We show that topological defects in this field, which are long-lived yet display rich dynamics, act as organization centres with morphological features developing at defect sites. These observations suggest that the nematic orientation field can be considered a &#8216;mechanical morphogen&#8217; whose dynamics, in conjugation with various biochemical and mechanical signalling processes, result in the robust emergence of functional patterns during morphogenesis.</p>",[],False,"[""Yonit Maroudas-Sacks"", ""Liora Garion"", ""Lital Shani-Zerbib"", ""Anton Livshits"", ""Erez Braun"", ""Kinneret Keren""]","Maroudas-Sacks, Y., Garion, L., Shani-Zerbib, L. et al.

article,Directional self-locomotion of active droplets enabled by nematic environment,"<p>Active matter composed of self-propelled interacting units holds a major promise for the extraction of useful work from its seemingly chaotic dynamics. Streamlining active matter is especially important at the microscale, where the viscous forces prevail over inertia and transport requires a non-reciprocal motion. Here we report that microscopic active droplets representing aqueous dispersions of swimming bacteria Bacillus subtilis become unidirectionally motile when placed in an inactive nematic liquid-crystal medium. Random motion of bacteria inside the droplet is rectified into a directional self-locomotion of the droplet by the polar director structure that the droplet creates in the surrounding nematic through anisotropic molecular interactions at its surface. Droplets without active swimmers show no net displacement. The trajectory of the active droplet can be predesigned by patterning the molecular orientation of the nematic. The effect demonstrates that broken spatial symmetry of the medium can be the reason for and the means to control directional microscale transport.</p>",[],False,"[""Mojtaba Rajabi"", ""Hend Baza"", ""Taras Turiv"", ""Oleg D.

article,Theory of mechanochemical patterning and optimal migration in cell monolayers,"<p>Collective cell migration offers a rich field of study for non-equilibrium physics and cellular biology, revealing phenomena such as glassy dynamics, pattern formation and active turbulence. However, how mechanical and chemical signalling are integrated at the cellular level to give rise to such collective behaviours remains unclear. We address this by focusing on the highly conserved phenomenon of spatiotemporal waves of density and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, which appear both in vitro and in vivo during collective cell migration and wound healing. First, we propose a biophysical theory, backed by mechanical and optogenetic perturbation experiments, showing that patterns can be quantitatively explained by a mechanochemical coupling between active cellular tensions and the mechanosensitive ERK pathway. Next, we demonstrate how this biophysical mechanism can robustly induce long-ranged order and migration in a desired orientation, and we determine the theoretically optimal wavelength and period for inducing maximal migration towards free edges, which fits well with experimentally observed dynamics. We thereby provide a bridge between the biophysical origin of spatiotemporal instabilities and the design principles of robust and efficient long-ranged migration.</p>",[],False,"[""Daniel Boocock"", ""Naoya Hino"", ""Natalia Ruzickova"", ""Tsuyoshi Hirashima"", ""Edouard Hannezo""]","Boocock, D., Hino, N., Ruzickova, N. et al.

article,Capturing the continuous complexity of behaviour in Caenorhabditis elegans,"<p>Animal behaviour is often quantified through subjective, incomplete variables that mask essential dynamics. Here, we develop a maximally predictive behavioural-state space from multivariate measurements, in which the full instantaneous state is smoothly unfolded as a combination of short-time posture sequences. In the off-food behaviour of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, we discover a low-dimensional state space dominated by three sets of cyclic trajectories corresponding to the worm&#8217;s basic stereotyped motifs: forward, backward and turning locomotion. We find similar results in the on-food behaviour of foraging worms and npr-1 mutants. In contrast to this broad stereotypy, we find variability in the presence of locally unstable dynamics with signatures of deterministic chaos: a collection of unstable periodic orbits together with a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent. The full Lyapunov spectrum is symmetric with positive, chaotic exponents driving variability balanced by negative, dissipative exponents driving stereotypy.
