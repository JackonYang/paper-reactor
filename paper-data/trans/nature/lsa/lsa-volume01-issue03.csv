In this paper, passive technologies for large-scale photonic integrated circuits are described, including polarization handling, light non-reciprocity and loss reduction. The design rule for polarization beam splitters based on asymmetrical directional couplers is summarized and several novel designs for ultra-short polarization beam splitters are reviewed. A novel concept for realizing a polarization splitter&#8211;rotator is presented with a very simple fabrication process. Realization of silicon-based light non-reciprocity devices (e.g., optical isolator), which is very important for transmitters to avoid sensitivity to reflections, is also demonstrated with the help of magneto-optical material by the bonding technology. Low-loss waveguides are another important technology for large-scale photonic integrated circuits. Ultra-low loss optical waveguides are achieved by designing a Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> core with a very high aspect ratio. The loss is reduced further to &lt;0.1 dB m<sup>&#8722;1</sup> with an improved fabrication process incorporating a high-quality thermal oxide upper cladding by means of wafer bonding. With the developed ultra-low loss Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> optical waveguides, some devices are also demonstrated, including ultra-high-Q ring resonators, low-loss arrayed-waveguide grating (de)multiplexers, and high-extinction-ratio polarizers.</p>",<p>由于对光发射器，接收器和光缓冲器的更高复杂性和更低成本的需求，基于硅的大规模光子集成电路变得越来越重要。本文介绍了用于大规模光子集成电路的无源技术，包括偏振处理，光不可逆性和损耗减少。总结了基于非对称定向耦合器的偏振分束器的设计规则，并对几种超短偏振分束器的新颖设计进行了综述。通过非常简单的制造过程，提出了一种用于实现偏振分束器和旋转器的新颖概念。还通过结合技术借助磁光材料证明了硅基光不可逆器件（例如光隔离器）的实现对发射器避免对反射的敏感性非常重要。低损耗波导是用于大规模光子集成电路的另一项重要技术。超低损耗光波导是通过设计纵横比非常高的Si <sub> 3 </ sub> N <sub> 4 </ sub>纤芯而实现的。通过改进的制造工艺，通过晶片键合结合了高质量的热氧化物上覆层，损耗进一步降低到了<0.1 dB m <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>。利用已开发的超低损耗Si <sub> 3 </ sub> N <sub> 4 </ sub>光波导，还演示了一些器件，包括超高Q环形谐振器，低损耗阵列波导光栅。 （解复用器）和高消光比偏振器。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2012.2,Coherent excitation transfer via the dark-state channel in a bionic system,在仿生系统中通过暗态通道进行相干激发转移 ,"<p>Light absorption and energy transfer were studied in a bionic system with donors and an acceptor. In the optimal case of uniform couplings, this seemingly complicated system was reduced to a three-level &#923;-type system. With this observation, we showed that the efficiency of energy transfer through a dark-state channel, which is free of the spontaneous decay of the donors, was dramatically improved. After the overall average transfer time was evaluated, it was revealed that the time required for transfer through this channel was not optimal. To find the optimal parameters for the present system, we defined a new quantity, output power, which characterizes the average mean output of the whole transfer process. We estimated the optimal parameters of the system to achieve the maximum output power. The splitting behaviour of the maximum power may be used to explain the phenomenon of photosynthetic systems primarily absorbing two colours of light.</p>",在具有供体和受主的仿生系统中研究了光吸收和能量转移。 在均匀耦合的最佳情况下，这个看似复杂的系统被简化为三级＆＃923;型系统。 通过这一观察，我们表明，通过暗态通道进行的能量传递效率得到了极大提高，该通道没有施主的自发衰减。 在评估了总体平均传输时间之后，发现通过该通道传输所需的时间不是最佳的。 为了找到本系统的最佳参数，我们定义了一个新的数量，即输出功率，它表征了整个传输过程的平均平均输出。 我们估算了系统的最佳参数，以实现最大输出功率。 最大功率的分裂行为可以用来解释光合作用系统主要吸收两种颜色的光的现象。</ p>
