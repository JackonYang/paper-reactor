10.1038/lsa.2012.10,Hardfacing steel with nanostructured coatings of Stellite-6 by supersonic laser deposition,超音速激光沉积具有Stellite-6纳米结构涂层的表面堆焊钢 ,"<p>The ability to manufacture coatings is critical to engineering design. Many components require the application of additional layers to enhance mechanical properties and protect against hostile environments. Supersonic laser deposition (SLD) is a novel coating method based on cold spray (CS) principles. In this technique, the deposition velocities can be significantly lower than those required for effective bonding in CS applications. The addition of laser heat energy permits a change in the thermodynamic experience of impacting particles, thereby offering a greater opportunity for efficient bonding at lower velocities as compared with the CS process. The work reported in this paper demonstrates the ability of the SLD process to deliver hardfacing materials to engineering surfaces. Stellite-6 has been deposited on low-carbon steel tubes over a range of process parameters to establish the appropriate target power and traverse speeds for the coating formation. The coating properties and parameters were examined to determine the primary characteristics and grain structure size. Their morphology and performance were studied through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction, hardness measurements and wear testing. The results have shown that SLD is capable of depositing layers of Stellite-6, with properties that are superior to those of their conventionally manufactured counterparts.</p>",<p>制造涂料的能力对工程设计至关重要。许多组件都需要应用其他层来增强机械性能并防止恶劣的环境。超音速激光沉积（SLD）是一种基于冷喷涂（CS）原理的新颖涂覆方法。在这种技术中，沉积速度可能大大低于CS应用中有效粘合所需的速度。激光热能的增加允许改变撞击粒子的热力学体验，从而与CS工艺相比，在较低的速度下提供了更大的机会进行有效粘结。本文报道的工作证明了SLD工艺将硬面材料输送到工程表面的能力。 Stellite-6已通过一系列工艺参数沉积在低碳钢管上，以为涂层的形成确定合适的目标功率和移动速度。检查涂层性能和参数以确定主要特性和晶粒结构尺寸。通过光学显微镜，扫描电子显微镜（SEM），X射线衍射，硬度测量和磨损测试研究了它们的形态和性能。结果表明，SLD能够沉积Stellite-6层，其性能优于常规制造的同类产品。</ p>
