The efficiency of the photoelectric conversion of gold nanoparticle layers is increased as the intensity of surface plasmon resonance increases. We also explain the experimental results by modeling the phenomenon of charge separation and photocurrent formation, and the relationship between surface plasmon resonance and photocurrent formation, which has potential application in plasmon-sensitized solar cells and plasmonic solar cells in the future.</p>",<p>层状金纳米颗粒用于在环境友好的等离子体激元敏感的太阳能电池中拖曳光电流至表面等离子体共振。 随着表面等离子体共振的强度增加，金纳米颗粒层的光电转换效率增加。 我们还通过对电荷分离和光电流形成现象以及表面等离子体激元共振与光电流形成之间的关系进行建模来解释实验结果，这在未来的等离子体激元敏感的太阳能电池和等离子体激元太阳能电池中具有潜在的应用前景。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2012.16,Single and multiple optical switches that use freestanding silicon nanowire waveguide couplers,使用独立式硅纳米线波导耦合器的单个和多个光开关 ,"<p>Silicon photonic devices consisting of nanowire waveguides are a promising technology for on-chip integration in future optical telecommunication and interconnection systems based on silicon-large scale integration fabrication. However, the accommodation of variable optical components on a chip remains challenging due to the small size of microchips. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of a microelectromechanical silicon nanowire waveguide switch with a gap-variable coupler. Due to its capacitive operation, the proposed waveguide switch consumed negligible power relative to switches that use a thermo-optical effect and carrier injection. The proposed switch was characterized using analyses based on coupled-mode theory for rectangular waveguides, as well as a simulation using the finite difference time domain method. A 2&#215;2 single switch with an improved configuration and a 2&#215;6 multiple switch composed of the 2&#215;2 switches was designed and fabricated by a combination of electron beam lithography, fast-atom beam etching and hydrofluoric acid vapor sacrificial etching. The properties of the switches were measured and evaluated at a wavelength of 1.55&#160;&#181;m.</p>",<p>由纳米线波导组成的硅光子器件是一种有前途的技术，可用于未来基于硅大规模集成制造的光通信和互连系统中的片上集成。然而，由于微芯片的小尺寸，将可变光学部件容纳在芯片上仍然具有挑战性。在这项研究中，我们研究了具有间隙可变耦合器的微机电硅纳米线波导开关的特性。由于其电容性操作，与使用热光效应和载流子注入的开关相比，拟议的波导开关的功耗可忽略不计。通过基于矩形波导耦合模式理论的分析以及使用时域有限差分法进行仿真，对提出的开关进行了表征。通过电子束光刻，快速原子束蚀刻和氢氟酸的组合，设计和制造了具有改进配置的2＆＃215; 2单开关和由2＆＃215; 2开关组成的2＆＃215; 6多开关气相牺牲蚀刻。在1.55＆＃160;＆＃181; m的波长下测量和评估了开关的性能。</ p>
