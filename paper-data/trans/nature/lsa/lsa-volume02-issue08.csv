10.1038/lsa.2013.44,Non-locality and collective emission in disordered lasing resonators,无序激光谐振器的非局域性和集体发射 ,"<p>Random lasing is observed in optically active resonators in the presence of disorder. As the optical cavities involved are open, the modes are coupled, and energy may pour from one state to another provided that they are spatially overlapping. Although the electromagnetic modes are spatially localized, our system may be actively switched to a collective state, presenting a novel form of non-locality revealed by a high degree of spectral correlation between the light emissions collected at distant positions. In a nutshell, light may be stored in a disordered nonlinear structure in different fashions that strongly differ in their spatial properties. This effect is experimentally demonstrated and theoretically explained in titania clusters embedded in a dye, and it provides clear evidence of a transition to a multimodal collective emission involving the entire spatial extent of the disordered system. Our results can be used to develop a novel type of miniaturized, actively controlled all-optical chip.</p>",在有无序的情况下，在光学有源谐振器中观察到随机激射。当涉及的光学腔打开时，这些模式会耦合，并且能量可能会从一种状态倾泻到另一种状态，前提是它们在空间上重叠。尽管电磁模式在空间上是局部的，但我们的系统可能会主动切换到集合状态，从而呈现出一种新颖的非局部形式，这种异质性是由在远处收集的光发射之间的高度光谱相关性揭示的。简而言之，光可以以无序的非线性结构以不同的方式存储，这些方式在其空间特性上有很大不同。在嵌入染料的二氧化钛簇中，通过实验证明并从理论上解释了这种效应，它为过渡到涉及无序系统整个空间范围的多峰集体发射提供了明确的证据。我们的结果可用于开发一种新型的小型，主动控制的全光学芯片。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2013.46,Light spectral filtering based on spatial adiabatic passage,基于空间绝热通道的光谱滤波 ,"<p>We present the first experimental realization of a light spectral filter based on the spatial adiabatic passage technique. We demonstrate that a fully integrable CMOS-compatible system of three coupled identical total internal reflection silicon oxide waveguides with variable separation along their propagation direction can be used simultaneously as a low- and high-pass spectral filter within the visible range of wavelengths. Light is injected into the right waveguide, and after propagating along the system, long wavelengths are transferred into the left output, whereas short wavelengths propagate to the right and central outputs. The stopband reaches values up to &#8722;11&#160;dB for the left output and approximately &#8722;20&#160;dB for the right plus central outputs. The passband values are close to 0&#160;dB for both cases. We also demonstrate that the filtering characteristics of the device can be controlled by modifying the parameter values, which define the geometry of the triple-waveguide system. However, the general filtering behavior of the system does not critically depend on technological variations. Thus, the spatial adiabatic passage filtering approach constitutes an alternative to other integrated filtering devices, such as interference or absorbance-based filters.</p>",<p>我们提出了基于空间绝热通过技术的光谱滤波器的第一个实验实现。我们证明了一个完全可集成的CMOS兼容系统，该系统具有三个耦合的相同的全内反射氧化硅波导，沿其传播方向具有可变间隔，它们可以同时用作可见波长范围内的低通和高通光谱滤波器。光被注入到右波导中，沿着系统传播后，长波长被传输到左输出，而短波长则传播到右和中心输出。对于左输出，阻带达到的值高达＆＃8722; 11＆＃160; dB，对于右加中央输出，阻带达到的值约为＆＃8722; 20＆＃160; dB。在两种情况下，通带值均接近０＃160; dB。我们还演示了可以通过修改参数值来控制设备的滤波特性，这些参数值定义了三重波导系统的几何形状。但是，系统的一般过滤行为并不严格取决于技术变化。因此，空间绝热通道过滤方法构成了其他集成过滤设备的替代方案，例如基于干涉或吸收率的过滤器。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2013.48,Exceeding the limit of plasmonic light trapping in textured screen-printed solar cells using Al nanoparticles and wrinkle-like graphene sheets,使用Al纳米颗粒和皱纹状石墨烯片的网状丝印太阳能电池中等离子光捕获的极限 ,"<p>The solar cell market is predominantly based on textured screen-printed solar cells. Due to parasitic absorption in nanostructures, using plasmonic processes to obtain an enhancement that exceeds 2.5% of the short-circuit photocurrent density is challenging. In this paper, a 7.2% enhancement in the photocurrent density can be achieved through the integration of plasmonic Al nanoparticles and wrinkle-like graphene sheets. For the first time, we experimentally achieve Al nanoparticle-enhanced solar cells. An innovative thermal evaporation method is proposed to fabricate low-coverage Al nanoparticle arrays on solar cells. Due to the ultraviolet (UV) plasmon resonance of Al nanoparticles, the performance enhancement of the solar cells is significantly greater than that from Ag nanoparticles. Subsequently, we deposit wrinkle-like graphene sheets over the Al nanoparticle-enhanced solar cells. Compared with planar graphene sheets, the bend carbon layer also exhibits a broadband light-trapping effect. Our results exceed the limit of plasmonic light trapping in textured screen-printed silicon solar cells.</p>",<p>太阳能电池市场主要基于网状丝网印刷太阳能电池。由于纳米结构中的寄生吸收，使用等离激元工艺获得超过短路光电流密度的2.5％的增强效应具有挑战性。在本文中，通过等离子体铝纳米颗粒和皱纹状石墨烯片的集成可以实现光电流密度提高7.2％。首次，我们通过实验获得了Al纳米颗粒增强型太阳能电池。提出了一种创新的热蒸发方法来在太阳能电池上制造低覆盖率的Al纳米粒子阵列。由于铝纳米颗粒的紫外线（UV）等离子体共振，太阳能电池的性能增强明显大于银纳米颗粒。随后，我们在铝纳米颗粒增强的太阳能电池上沉积了皱纹状石墨烯片。与平面石墨烯片相比，弯曲碳层还表现出宽带捕光效果。我们的结果超出了在带纹理的丝网印刷硅太阳能电池中等离子捕获的极限。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2013.50,Silicon micromirrors with three-dimensional curvature enabling lensless efficient coupling of free-space light,具有三维曲率的硅微镜可实现无透镜高效耦合自由空间光 ,"<p>Miniaturized optical benches process free-space light propagating in-plane with respect to the substrate and have a large variety of applications, including the coupling of light through an optical fiber. High coupling efficiency is usually obtained using assembled micro-optical parts, which considerably increase the system cost and integration effort. In this work, we report a high coupling efficiency, monolithically integrated silicon micromirror with controlled three-dimensional (3D) curvature that is capable of manipulating optical beams propagating in the plane of the silicon substrate. Based on our theoretical modeling, a spherical micromirror with a microscale radius of curvature as small as twice the Gaussian beam Rayleigh range provides a 100% coupling efficiency over a relatively long optical path range. Introducing dimensionless parameters facilitates the elucidation of the role of key design parameters, including the mirror's radii of curvature, independent of the wavelength. A micromachining method is presented for fabricating the 3D micromirror using fluorinated gas plasmas. The measured coupling efficiency was greater than 50% over a 200-&#956;m optical path, compared to less than 10% afforded by a conventional flat micromirror, which was in good agreement with the model. Using the 3D micromirror, an optical cavity was formed with a round-trip diffraction loss of less than 0.4%, resulting in one order of magnitude enhancement in the measured quality factor. A nearly 100% coupling was also estimated when matching the sagittal and tangential radii of curvature of the presented micromirror&#8217;s surface. The reported class of 3D micromirrors may be an advantageous replacement for the optical lenses usually assembled in silicon photonics and optical benches by transforming them into real 3D monolithic systems while achieving wideband high coupling efficiency over submillimeter distances.</p>",<p>小型化的光具座可处理相对于基板在平面内传播的自由空间光，并具有多种应用，包括通过光纤的光耦合。通常，使用组装好的微光学部件可以获得很高的耦合效率，这大大增加了系统成本和集成工作量。在这项工作中，我们报告了具有高耦合效率的，具有受控的三维（3D）曲率的单片集成硅微镜，该微镜能够操纵在硅基板平面内传播的光束。根据我们的理论模型，球形微镜的微曲率半径小到高斯光束瑞利范围的两倍，可在相对较长的光程范围内提供100％的耦合效率。引入无量纲参数有助于阐明关键设计参数的作用，包括镜子的曲率半径，而与波长无关。提出了一种使用氟化气体等离子体制造3D微镜的微加工方法。在200米的光路上，测得的耦合效率大于50％，而传统的平面微镜的耦合效率小于10％，这与该模型非常吻合。使用3D微镜，形成的光腔的往返衍射损耗小于0.4％，从而使测量的品质因数提高了一个数量级。当匹配所呈现的微镜表面的弧矢半径和切向曲率半径时，也估计出接近100％的耦合。报道的3D微镜类别可以替代通常组装在硅光子学和光学平台中的光学镜片，将其转变为真正的3D整体系统，同时在亚毫米距离上实现宽带高耦合效率。</ p>
