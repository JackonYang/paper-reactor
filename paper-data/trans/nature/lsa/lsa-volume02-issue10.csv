10.1038/lsa.2013.58,Functionalized polymer nanofibers: a versatile platform for manipulating light at the nanoscale,功能化的聚合物纳米纤维：用于处理纳米级光的多功能平台 ,"<p>As an organic optical fiber with a diameter comparable to or less than the wavelength of light, polymer nanofibers have been attracting increasing attention as a platform for manipulating light at the nanoscale. A variety of applications for polymer optical nanofibers, including waveguides, light sources and sensors, have been reported in recent years. In this article, the recent progress in the field of polymer optical nanofibers is reviewed in terms of their fabrication, characterization and applications. In particular, we focus on functionalized polymer nanofibers doped with functional materials, such as dye molecules, noble metal nanoparticles, quantum dots and rare earth ions, which greatly expand their capabilities of generating, propagating, converting and modulating light at the nanoscale.</p>",作为直径等于或小于光的波长的有机光纤，聚合物纳米纤维作为操纵纳米级光的平台已引起越来越多的关注。 近年来，已经报道了聚合物光学纳米纤维的各种应用，包括波导，光源和传感器。 在本文中，从聚合物光学纳米纤维的制备，表征和应用方面对聚合物光学纳米纤维领域的最新进展进行了综述。 特别是，我们专注于掺杂有功能材料的功能化聚合物纳米纤维，例如染料分子，贵金属纳米颗粒，量子点和稀土离子，它们极大地扩展了它们在纳米级产生，传播，转换和调制光的能力。</ >

Optical super-resolution imaging, which has recently experienced rapid growth and attracted increasing global interest, will result in applications in many domains, benefiting fields such as biology, medicine and material research.

10.1038/lsa.2013.62,Improving metal reflectors by suppressing surface plasmon polaritons: a priori calculation of the internal reflectance of a solar cell,通过抑制表面等离子体激元极化子来改善金属反射器：太阳能电池内部反射率的先验计算 ,"<p>Imperfect internal reflectance of near-bandgap light reduces the performance of all solar cells, and becomes increasingly detrimental as absorbers become thinner. We consider light incident on the silicon/dielectric/metal structure at the back of rear-passivated crystalline silicon solar cells with surface textures that are large enough for geometric optics. By calculating the absorbance in the metal as a function of the angle of incidence, we discover three results that are important for understanding and improving rear reflectors in many types of solar cells. First, significant parasitic absorption occurs in the metal layer in two cases: s- and p-polarized propagating modes (near-normal angles of incidence) when the dielectric thickness is adjusted to cause destructive interference of the reflected beams, and p-polarized evanescent modes (angles of incidence above the semiconductor/dielectric critical angle) that excite surface plasmon polaritons at the metal surface. Second, the latter loss dominates; a well-designed rear dielectric passivation layer must suppress the penetration of evanescent waves to the metal. Third, when used as an input in a simple analytical model, the average rear internal reflectance calculated by assuming a Lambertian angular distribution of light accurately predicts the total reflectance and absorbance of a solar cell.</p>",<p>近带隙光的不完美内部反射会降低所有太阳能电池的性能，并且随着吸收剂变得更薄而变得越来越有害。我们考虑光入射到背面钝化的晶体硅太阳能电池背面的硅/介电/金属结构上，其表面纹理对于几何光学来说足够大。通过计算金属的吸光度作为入射角的函数，我们发现了三个结果，这些结果对于理解和改进许多类型的太阳能电池中的后反射器很重要。首先，在两种情况下，金属层中会发生大量的寄生吸收：调整介电层厚度以引起反射光束的相消干涉时，s极化和p极化传播模式（接近法线入射角），以及p极化瞬逝激发金属表面的表面等离激元极化子的模式（入射角大于半导体/介电临界角）。其次，后者的损失占主导。设计良好的背面电介质钝化层必须抑制van逝波对金属的穿透。第三，当在简单的分析模型中用作输入时，通过假设光的朗伯角分布来计算的平均后部内部反射率可准确预测太阳能电池的总反射率和吸收率。</ p>
