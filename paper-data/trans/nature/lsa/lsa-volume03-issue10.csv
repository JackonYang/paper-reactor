10.1038/lsa.2014.90,320-fold luminescence enhancement of [Ru(dpp)3]Cl2 dispersed on PMMA opal photonic crystals and highly improved oxygen sensing performance,分散在PMMA蛋白石光子晶体上的[Ru（dpp）3] Cl2的发光增强320倍，并且氧感测性能大大提高 ,"<p>Ru complexes ([Ru(dpp)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub>) were spin coated on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) opal photonic crystals (PhCs), and a &#8764;320-fold luminescence enhancement was observed compared to that on glass, which is the largest luminescence enhancement of dye molecules by the modulation of three-dimensional (3D) PhCs reported until now. The enhancement mechanism was carefully examined and it was shown that the luminescence of [Ru(dpp)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> depended on the molecule concentration and temperature. It can be concluded that the suppressed non-radiative relaxation among the molecules and the field enhancement both contribute significantly to the luminescence enhancement. The PMMA PhC/Ru complex composites were then tested for their intracellular oxygen sensing and cell imaging properties; these composites effectively improved the limit of detection (LOD) and the brightness of the cell images.</p>",将<p> Ru络合物（[Ru（dpp）<sub> 3 </ sub>] Cl <sub> 2 </ sub>）旋涂在聚甲基丙烯酸甲酯（PMMA）蛋白石光子晶体（PhCs）上，然后 与玻璃上相比，观察到＆＃8764; 320倍的发光增强，这是迄今为止报道的通过三维（3D）PhC的调制对染料分子的最大发光增强。 仔细研究了增强机理，结果表明[Ru（dpp）<sub> 3 </ sub>] Cl <sub> 2 </ sub>的发光取决于分子浓度和温度。 可以得出结论，分子之间的抑制的非辐射弛豫和场增强两者均对发光增强有显着贡献。 然后测试了PMMA PhC / Ru复合物的细胞内氧传感和细胞成像特性。 这些合成物有效地改善了检测限（LOD）和细胞图像的亮度。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2014.92,A concept for multiterawatt fibre lasers based on coherent pulse stacking in passive cavities,基于无源腔中相干脉冲堆叠的多兆瓦光纤激光器的概念 ,"<p>Since the advent of femtosecond lasers, performance improvements have constantly impacted on existing applications and enabled novel applications. However, one performance feature bearing the potential of a quantum leap for high-field applications is still not available: the simultaneous emission of extremely high peak and average powers. Emerging applications such as laser particle acceleration require exactly this performance regime and, therefore, challenge laser technology at large. On the one hand, canonical bulk systems can provide pulse peak powers in the multi-terawatt to petawatt range, while on the other hand, advanced solid-state-laser concepts such as the thin disk, slab or fibre are well known for their high efficiency and their ability to emit high average powers in the kilowatt range with excellent beam quality. In this contribution, a compact laser system capable of simultaneously providing high peak and average powers with high wall-plug efficiency is proposed and analysed. The concept is based on the temporal coherent combination (pulse stacking) of a pulse train emitted from a high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser system in a passive enhancement cavity. Thus, the pulse energy is increased at the cost of the repetition rate while almost preserving the average power. The concept relies on a fast switching element for dumping the enhanced pulse out of the cavity. The switch constitutes the key challenge of our proposal. Addressing this challenge could, for the first time, allow the highly efficient dumping of joule-class pulses at megawatt average power levels and lead to unprecedented laser parameters.</p>",<p>自从飞秒激光器问世以来，性能的提高一直在影响现有应用并实现新颖的应用。但是，仍然无法获得一种具有在高场应用中实现量子飞跃潜力的性能功能：同时发射极高的峰值和平均功率。诸如激光粒子加速之类的新兴应用正是需要这种性能机制，因此对整个激光技术提出了挑战。一方面，规范的批量系统可以提供数兆瓦至PB的脉冲峰值功率，另一方面，诸如薄盘，平板或光纤等先进的固态激光器概念因其高功率而闻名。效率以及它们以出色的光束质量发出千瓦范围内高平均功率的能力。为此，提出并分析了能够同时提供高峰值功率和平均功率以及高壁塞效率的紧凑型激光系统。该概念基于从无源增强腔中的高重复频率飞秒激光系统发射的脉冲序列的时间相干组合（脉冲堆叠）。因此，在几乎保持平均功率的同时，以重复率为代价增加了脉冲能量。该概念依赖于快速开关元件，用于将增强的脉冲从腔中倾出。转换构成了我们提案的关键挑战。应对这一挑战将首次实现以兆瓦平均功率水平高效倾销焦耳级脉冲，并带来前所未有的激光参数。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2014.96,Colored ultrathin hybrid photovoltaics with high quantum efficiency,具有高量子效率的彩色超薄混合光伏电池 ,"<p>Most current solar panels are fabricated via complex processes using expensive semiconductor materials, and they are rigid and heavy with a dull, black appearance. As a result of their non-aesthetic appearance and weight, they are primarily installed on rooftops to minimize their negative impact on building appearance. The large surfaces and interiors of modern buildings are not efficiently utilized for potential electric power generation. Here, we introduce dual-function solar cells based on ultrathin dopant-free amorphous silicon embedded in an optical cavity that not only efficiently extract the photogenerated carriers but also display distinctive colors with the desired angle-insensitive appearances. Light-energy-harvesting colored signage is demonstrated. Furthermore, a cascaded photovoltaics scheme based on tunable spectrum splitting can be employed to increase power efficiency by absorbing a broader band of light energy. This study pioneers a new approach to architecturally compatible and decorative thin-film photovoltaics.</p>",<p>大多数当前的太阳能电池板是使用昂贵的半导体材料通过复杂的工艺制成的，并且坚固，笨重，外观暗淡，发黑。由于其不美观的外观和重量，它们主要安装在屋顶上，以最大程度地减少对建筑物外观的负面影响。现代建筑物的大表面和内部不能有效地用于潜在的发电。在这里，我们介绍了一种双功能太阳能电池，该电池基于嵌入光腔中的无掺杂剂的超薄无定形硅，不仅可以有效地提取光生载流子，而且还可以显示具有所需角度不敏感外观的独特颜色。展示了光能收集彩色标牌。此外，可以采用基于可调光谱分裂的级联光伏方案，以通过吸收更宽的光能带来提高功率效率。这项研究开创了一种在建筑上兼容和装饰的薄膜光伏产品的新方法。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2014.99,"Coding metamaterials, digital metamaterials and programmable metamaterials",编码超材料，数字超材料和可编程超材料 ,"<p>Metamaterials are artificial structures that are usually described by effective medium parameters on the macroscopic scale, and these metamaterials are referred to as &#8216;analog metamaterials&#8217;. Here, we propose &#8216;digital metamaterials&#8217; through two steps. First, we present &#8216;coding metamaterials&#8217; that are composed of only two types of unit cells, with 0 and &#960; phase responses, which we name &#8216;0&#8217; and &#8216;1&#8217; elements, respectively. By coding &#8216;0&#8217; and &#8216;1&#8217; elements with controlled sequences (i.e., 1-bit coding), we can manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves and realize different functionalities. The concept of coding metamaterials can be extended from 1-bit coding to 2-bit coding or higher. In 2-bit coding, four types of unit cells, with phase responses of 0, &#960;/2, &#960;, and 3&#960;/2, are required to mimic the &#8216;00&#8217;, &#8216;01&#8217;, &#8216;10&#8217; and &#8216;11&#8217; elements, respectively. The 2-bit coding has greater freedom than 1-bit coding for controlling EM waves. Second, we propose a unique metamaterial particle that has either a &#8216;0&#8217; or &#8216;1&#8217; response controlled by a biased diode. Based on this particle, we present &#8216;digital metamaterials&#8217; with unit cells that possess either a &#8216;0&#8217; or &#8216;1&#8217; state. Using a field-programmable gate array, we realize digital control over the digital metamaterial. By programming different coding sequences, a single digital metamaterial has the ability to manipulate EM waves in different manners, thereby realizing &#8216;programmable metamaterials&#8217;. The above concepts and physical phenomena are confirmed through numerical simulations and experiments using metasurfaces.</p>","<p>超材料是通常由宏观尺度上有效介质参数描述的人工结构，这些超材料称为“模拟超材料”。在这里，我们提出＆＃8216;数字超材料＆＃8217;通过两个步骤。首先，我们介绍＆＃8216;编码超材料＆＃8217;仅由两种类型的单位单元组成，分别为0和＆＃960;相响应，我们将其命名为＆＃8216; 0＆＃8217;和＆＃8216; 1＆＃8217;元素分别。通过编码＆＃8216; 0＆＃8217;和＆＃8216; 1＆＃8217;具有受控序列（即1位编码）的元素，我们可以操纵电磁（EM）波并实现不同的功能。编码超材料的概念可以从1位编码扩展到2位编码或更高。在2位编码中，需要四种类型的单位单元，其相位响应分别为0，＆＃960; / 2，＆＃960;和3＆＃960; / 2，才能模仿＆＃8216; 00＆＃8217 ;，＆＃8216; 01＆＃8217 ;,＆＃8216; 10＆＃8217;和＆＃8216; 11＆＃8217;元素分别。 2位编码比用于控制EM波的1位编码具有更大的自由度。其次，我们提出一个独特的超材料粒子，该粒子具有＆＃8216; 0＆＃8217;或＆＃8216; 1＆＃8217;响应由偏置二极管控制。基于此粒子，我们展示了＆＃8216;数字超材料＆＃8217;具有拥有＆＃8216; 0＆＃8217;的单位单元或＆＃8216; 1＆＃8217;州。使用现场可编程门阵列，我们实现了对数字超材料的数字控制。通过对不同的编码序列进行编程，单个数字超材料具有以不同方式操纵EM波的能力，从而实现了“可编程超材料”。上述概念和物理现象通过超表面的数值模拟和实验得到了证实。</ p> "
