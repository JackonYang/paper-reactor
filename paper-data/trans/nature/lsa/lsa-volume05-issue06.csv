10.1038/lsa.2016.80,Metallic nanostructures for efficient LED lighting,金属纳米结构可实现高效的LED照明 ,"<p>Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are driving a shift toward energy-efficient illumination. Nonetheless, modifying the emission intensities, colors and directionalities of LEDs in specific ways remains a challenge often tackled by incorporating secondary optical components. Metallic nanostructures supporting plasmonic resonances are an interesting alternative to this approach due to their strong light&#8211;matter interaction, which facilitates control over light emission without requiring external secondary optical components. This review discusses new methods that enhance the efficiencies of LEDs using nanostructured metals. This is an emerging field that incorporates physics, materials science, device technology and industry. First, we provide a general overview of state-of-the-art LED lighting, discussing the main characteristics required of both quantum wells and color converters to efficiently generate white light. Then, we discuss the main challenges in this field as well as the potential of metallic nanostructures to circumvent them. We review several of the most relevant demonstrations of LEDs in combination with metallic nanostructures, which have resulted in light-emitting devices with improved performance. We also highlight a few recent studies in applied plasmonics that, although exploratory and eminently fundamental, may lead to new solutions in illumination.</p>",<p>发光二极管（LED）推动了向节能照明的转变。尽管如此，以特定方式改变LED的发射强度，颜色和方向仍然是通过结合次级光学组件来解决的挑战。支持等离子共振的金属纳米结构是这种方法的一种有趣的替代方法，因为它们具有很强的光相互作用，从而无需外部次级光学组件即可促进对光发射的控制。这篇评论讨论了使用纳米结构金属提高LED效率的新方法。这是一个新兴领域，融合了物理，材料科学，设备技术和工业。首先，我们提供了最先进的LED照明的概述，讨论了量子阱和颜色转换器有效产生白光所需的主要特性。然后，我们讨论了该领域的主要挑战以及金属纳米结构规避它们的潜力。我们回顾了与金属纳米结构相结合的LED的几个最相关的演示，这些演示已使发光器件的性能得到了改善。我们还重点介绍了最近在应用等离子技术中的一些研究，这些研究虽然具有探索性和根本性的意义，但可能会为照明领域带来新的解决方案。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.84,Long-term in vivo single-cell lineage tracing of deep structures using three-photon activation,使用三光子激活的深层结构的长期体内单细胞谱系追踪 ,"<p>Genetic labeling techniques allow for noninvasive lineage tracing of cells in vivo. Two-photon inducible activators provide spatial resolution for superficial cells, but labeling cells located deep within tissues is precluded by scattering of the far-red illumination required for two-photon photolysis. Three-photon illumination has been shown to overcome the limitations of two-photon microscopy for in vivo imaging of deep structures, but whether it can be used for photoactivation remains to be tested. Here we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that three-photon illumination overcomes scattering problems by combining longer wavelength excitation with high uncaging three-photon cross-section molecules. We prospectively labeled heart muscle cells in zebrafish embryos and found permanent labeling in their progeny in adult animals with negligible tissue damage. This technique allows for a noninvasive genetic manipulation in vivo with spatial, temporal and cell-type specificity, and may have wide applicability in experimental biology.</p>",<p>基因标记技术允许在体内对细胞进行非侵入性谱系追踪。双光子诱导型活化剂为浅层细胞提供了空间分辨率，但是通过散射双光子光解所需的远红光，可以排除位于组织深处的标记细胞。三光子照明已被证明克服了深层结构体内成像的两光子显微镜技术的局限性，但是否可以用于光激活仍有待检验。在这里我们在理论上和实验上都表明，三光子照明通过将更长的波长激发与高解开的三光子横截面分子相结合，克服了散射问题。我们对斑马鱼胚胎中的心肌细胞进行了前瞻性标记，并在成年动物的后代中发现了永久性标记，其组织损伤可忽略不计。该技术可在体内进行具有空间，时间和细胞类型特异性的非侵入性遗传操作，在实验生物学中可能具有广泛的适用性。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.86,Pulse generation with ultra-superluminal pulse propagation in semiconductor heterostructures by superradiant-phase transition enhanced by transient coherent population gratings,瞬态相干种群光栅增强的超辐射相变在半导体异质结构中产生超超发光脉冲传播的脉冲 ,"<p>This paper reports the observation of ultra-superluminal pulse propagation in multiple-contact semiconductor heterostructures in a superradiant emission regime, and shows definitively that it is a different class of emission from conventional spontaneous or stimulated emission. Coherent population gratings induced in the semiconductor medium under strong electrical pumping have been shown to cause a major decrease of the group refractive index, in the range of 5&#8211;40%. This decrease is much greater than that caused by conventional carrier depletion or chirp mechanisms. The decrease in refractive index in turn causes faster-than-c propagation of femtosecond pulses. The measurement also proves the existence of coherent amplification of electromagnetic pulses in semiconductors at room temperature, the coherence being strongly enhanced by interactions of the light with coherent transient gratings locked to carrier gratings. This pulse-generation technique is anticipated to have great potential in applications where highly coherent femtosecond optical pulses must be generated on demand.</p>",<p>本文报道了在超辐射发射条件下多触点半导体异质结构中超超发光脉冲传播的观察结果，并明确表明这是与常规自发或受激发射不同的发射类型。在强电泵浦下，在半导体介质中感应出的相干晶格光栅已引起群折射率的大幅降低，范围在5％至40％之间。这种降低远大于常规载流子耗尽或线性调频机制造成的降低。折射率的降低又导致飞秒脉冲的传播快于c。该测量还证明了室温下半导体中电磁脉冲的相干放大的存在，通过光与锁定到载波光栅的相干瞬态光栅的相互作用，相干性得到了极大增强。预计这种脉冲产生技术在必须按需产生高度相干的飞秒光脉冲的应用中具有巨大的潜力。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.88,Chaotic light at mid-infrared wavelength,中红外波长的混沌光 ,"<p>The onset of nonlinear dynamics and chaos is evidenced in a mid-infrared distributed feedback quantum cascade laser both in the temporal and frequency domains. As opposed to the commonly observed route to chaos in semiconductor lasers, which involves undamping of the laser relaxation oscillations, quantum cascade lasers first exhibit regular self-pulsation at the external cavity frequency before entering into a chaotic low-frequency fluctuation regime. The bifurcation sequence, similar to that already observed in class A gas lasers under optical feedback, results from the fast carrier relaxation dynamics occurring in quantum cascade lasers, as confirmed by numerical simulations. Such chaotic behavior can impact various practical applications including spectroscopy, which requires stable single-mode operation. It also allows the development of novel mid-infrared high-power chaotic light sources, thus enabling secure free-space high bit-rate optical communications based on chaos synchronization.</p>",<p>在时域和频域中的中红外分布式反馈量子级联激光器中都证明了非线性动力学和混沌的发生。与通常观察到的在半导体激光器中实现混沌的途径相反，后者涉及消除激光器的弛豫振荡，而量子级联激光器在进入混沌的低频波动状态之前，首先会在外腔频率处表现出规则的自脉动。分叉序列类似于在光学反馈下在A类气体激光器中已经观察到的分叉序列，这是由量子级联激光器中发生的快速载流子弛豫动力学导致的，如数值模拟所证实。这种混乱的行为会影响包括光谱学在内的各种实际应用，这需要稳定的单模操作。它还允许开发新颖的中红外高功率混沌光源，从而实现基于混沌同步的安全的自由空间高比特率光通信。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.134,Mirror-enhanced super-resolution microscopy,镜增强超分辨率显微镜 ,"<p>Axial excitation confinement beyond the diffraction limit is crucial to the development of next-generation, super-resolution microscopy. STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy offers lateral super-resolution using a donut-beam depletion, but its axial resolution is still over 500&#8201;nm. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is widely used for single-molecule localization, but its ability to detect molecules is limited to within the evanescent field of ~100&#8201;nm from the cell attachment surface. We find here that the axial thickness of the point spread function (PSF) during confocal excitation can be easily improved to 110&#8201;nm by replacing the microscopy slide with a mirror. The interference of the local electromagnetic field confined the confocal PSF to a 110-nm spot axially, which enables axial super-resolution with all laser-scanning microscopes. Axial sectioning can be obtained with wavelength modulation or by controlling the spacer between the mirror and the specimen. With no additional complexity, the mirror-assisted excitation confinement enhanced the axial resolution six-fold and the lateral resolution two-fold for STED, which together achieved 19-nm resolution to resolve the inner rim of a nuclear pore complex and to discriminate the contents of 120&#8201;nm viral filaments. The ability to increase the lateral resolution and decrease the thickness of an axial section using mirror-enhanced STED without increasing the laser power is of great importance for imaging biological specimens, which cannot tolerate high laser power.</p>",<p>超出衍射极限的轴向激发限制对于下一代超高分辨率显微镜的发展至关重要。模拟发射损耗（STED）纳米显微镜通过使用环形光束损耗提供了横向超分辨率，但其轴向分辨率仍然超过500纳米。全内反射荧光显微镜已广泛用于单分子定位，但其检测分子的能力仅限于距细胞附着表面约100nm的渐逝场内。我们在这里发现，通过用镜子替换显微镜载玻片，可以很容易地将共焦激发过程中的点扩散函数（PSF）的轴向厚度提高到110纳米。局部电磁场的干扰将共聚焦PSF轴向限制在110 nm的点上，这使得所有激光扫描显微镜都能实现轴向超分辨率。轴向切片可以通过波长调制或通过控制反射镜和样品之间的垫片来获得。无需额外的复杂性，镜面辅助激发限制将STED的轴向分辨率提高了6倍，将横向分辨率提高了2倍，这些分辨率共同实现了19 nm的分辨率，从而可解决核孔复合体的内缘并区分内容物120＆＃8201; nm病毒丝。使用镜面增强的STED在不增加激光功率的情况下提高横向分辨率和减小轴向截面厚度的能力对于无法承受高激光功率的生物标本成像非常重要。</ p>
