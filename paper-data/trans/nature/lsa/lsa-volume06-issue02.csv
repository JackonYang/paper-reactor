10.1038/lsa.2016.204,Effects of edge on graphene plasmons as revealed by infrared nanoimaging,红外纳米成像揭示边缘对石墨烯等离子体的影响 ,"<p>We used scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) to investigate the plasmonic properties of edges in well-defined graphene nanostructures, including sharp tapers, nanoribbons and nanogaps, which were all fabricated via the growth-etching chemical vapor deposition (GECVD) method. The obtained near-field images revealed the localized plasmon modes along the graphene nanoribbon; these modes strongly depended on the size of the graphene pattern, the angle of the tapered graphene and the infrared excitation wavelength. These interesting plasmon modes were verified by numerical simulations and explained by the reflection, and interference of electromagnetic waves at the graphene&#8211;SiO<sub>2</sub> edge. The constructive interference at the graphene nanogap caused by charge accumulation was demonstrated for the first time. Using the infrared nanoimaging technique, greater plasmon broadening was observed in the zigzag edge than in the armchair edge. Our study suggests that graphene edges should be separated by an effective working distance to avoid the overlapping of localized plasmon modes, which is very important for the design of graphene-based plasmonic circuits and devices.</p>",<p>我们使用散射型扫描近场光学显微镜（s-SNOM）研究了定义明确的石墨烯纳米结构中的边缘的等离子体性能，包括尖锐的锥度，纳米带和纳米间隙，这些都是通过生长蚀刻来制造的化学气相沉积（GECVD）方法。所获得的近场图像揭示了沿石墨烯纳米带的局部等离激元模态。这些模式在很大程度上取决于石墨烯图案的尺寸，锥形石墨烯的角度和红外激发波长。这些有趣的等离激元模式已通过数值模拟进行了验证，并通过电磁波在石墨烯SiO <sub> 2 </ sub>边缘的反射和干扰进行了解释。首次证明了由电荷积累引起的石墨烯纳米间隙的相长干涉。使用红外纳米成像技术，在锯齿形边缘比在扶手椅形边缘观察到更大的等离激元展宽。我们的研究表明，石墨烯边缘应隔开有效的工作距离，以避免局部等离激元模态重叠，这对于基于石墨烯的等离激元电路和器件的设计非常重要。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.207,Use of polarization freedom beyond polarization-division multiplexing to support high-speed and spectral-efficient data transmission,利用极化自由度（除了极化-分区复用之外）来支持高速和频谱高效的数据传输 ,"<p>Increasing the system capacity and spectral efficiency (SE) per unit bandwidth is one of the ultimate goals for data network designers, especially when using technologies compatible with current embedded fiber infrastructures. Among these, the polarization-division-multiplexing (PDM) scheme, which supports two independent data channels on a single wavelength with orthogonal polarization states, has become a standard one in most state-of-art telecommunication systems. Currently, however, only two polarization states (that is, PDM) can be used, setting a barrier for further SE improvement. Assisted by coherent detection and digital signal processing, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for pseudo-PDM of four states (PPDM-4) by manipulation of four linearly polarized data channels with the same wavelength. Without any modification of the fiber link, we successfully transmit a 100-Gb&#8201;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> PPDM-4 differential-phase-shift-keying signal over a 150-km single-mode fiber link. Such a method is expected to open new possibilities to fully explore the use of polarization freedom for capacity and SE improvement over existing fiber systems.</p>",<p>增加单位带宽的系统容量和频谱效率（SE）是数据网络设计人员的最终目标之一，尤其是在使用与当前嵌入式光纤基础结构兼容的技术时。其中，偏振分割复用（PDM）方案已在大多数先进的电信系统中成为标准方案，该方案在具有正交偏振态的单个波长上支持两个独立的数据信道。但是，目前只能使用两种偏振态（即PDM），这为进一步改善SE设置了障碍。在相干检测和数字信号处理的辅助下，我们提出并通过实验证明了通过操纵四个具有相同波长的线性偏振数据通道来对四种状态的伪PDM（PPDM-4）进行处理的方案。在不对光纤链路进行任何修改的情况下，我们成功地在150公里单模上传输了100 Gb＆＃8201; s <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup> PPDM-4差分相移键控信号光纤链路。这种方法有望开辟新的可能性，以全面探索利用偏振自由度来提高现有光纤系统的容量和改善SE的能力。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.208,Shaping the light amplified in a multimode fiber,整形多模光纤中放大的光 ,"<p>Propagation of light in multimode optical fibers usually gives a spatial and temporal randomization of the transmitted field similar to the propagation through scattering media. Randomization still applies when scattering or multimode propagation occurs in gain media. We demonstrate that appropriate structuration of the input beam wavefront can shape the light amplified by a rare-earth-doped multimode fiber. Profiling of the wavefront was achieved by a deformable mirror in combination with an iterative optimization process. We present experimental results and simulations showing the shaping of a single sharp spot at different places in the output cross-section of an ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier. Cleaning and narrowing of the amplifier far-field pattern was realized as well. Tailoring the wavefront to shape the amplified light can also serve to improve the effective gain. The shaping approach still works under gain saturation, showing the robustness of the method. Modeling and experiments attest that the shaping is effective even with a highly multimode fiber amplifier carrying up to 127 modes.</p>",光在多模光纤中的传播通常会给出传输场的空间和时间随机性，类似于通过散射介质的传播。当增益介质中发生散射或多模传播时，随机化仍然适用。我们证明了输入光束波阵面的适当结构可以使掺稀土多模光纤放大的光整形。波前的分析是通过可变形反射镜结合迭代优化过程实现的。我们提供的实验结果和模拟结果显示了掺sharp光纤放大器输出截面中不同位置的单个尖峰的整形。还实现了放大器远场图案的清洁和变窄。调整波前以使放大的光成形也可以用来提高有效增益。整形方法仍在增益饱和下工作，显示了该方法的鲁棒性。建模和实验证明，即使使用高达127种模式的高度多模光纤放大器，整形也是有效的。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.212,High-speed flow of interacting organic polaritons,相互作用有机极化子的高速流动 ,"<p>The strong coupling of an excitonic transition with an electromagnetic mode results in composite quasi-particles called exciton polaritons, which have been shown to combine the best properties of their individual components in semiconductor microcavities. However, the physics and applications of polariton flows in organic materials and at room temperature are still unexplored because of the poor photon confinement in such structures. Here, we demonstrate that polaritons formed by the hybridization of organic excitons with a Bloch surface wave are able to propagate for hundreds of microns showing remarkable third-order nonlinear interactions upon high injection density. These findings pave the way for the study of organic nonlinear light&#8211;matter fluxes and for a technologically promising route of the realization of dissipation-less on-chip polariton devices operating at room temperature.</p>",<p>激子跃迁与电磁模的强耦合会产生称为激子极化子的复合准粒子，已证明它们结合了半导体微腔中各个成分的最佳性能。 然而，由于这种结构中的光子限制较弱，因此在有机材料中以及在室温下极化子流的物理学和应用仍未得到开发。 在这里，我们证明了由有机激子与Bloch表面波杂交形成的极化子能够传播数百微米，在高注入密度下显示出显着的三阶非线性相互作用。 这些发现为有机非线性光物质通量的研究铺平了道路，为实现在室温下工作的无损耗片上极化子器件提供了技术上有希望的途径。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.214,Color-selective holographic retroreflector array for sensing applications,用于感测应用的选色全息逆向反射器阵列 ,"<p>Corner cube retroreflectors (CCRs) have applications in sensors, image processing, free space communication and wireless networks. The ability to construct low-loss wavelength filters embedded in CCRs can enable the development of wavelength multiplexing, tunable lasers and photonic integrated circuits. Here we created an ~10-&#956;m-thick holographic corner cube retroreflector (HCCR) array that acted as a color-selective wavelength filter and diffracted light at broad angles. Angle-resolved spectral measurements showed that the Bragg peak of the diffracted light from the HCCR array could be tuned from 460 to 545&#8201;nm by varying the incident angle. The HCCR array also exhibited a wavelength-selective tuning capability based on the rotation angle in the visible spectrum. HCCRs projected holographic images with the rotational property in the far field. The utility of the HCCR was demonstrated as optical temperature and relative humidity sensors that produced a visible colorimetric response for rapid diagnostics.</p>",<p>角锥后向反射器（CCR）应用于传感器，图像处理，自由空间通信和无线网络中。构建嵌入在CCR中的低损耗波长滤波器的能力可以实现波长复用，可调谐激光器和光子集成电路的开发。在这里，我们创建了一个厚度约10微米的全息角立方逆向反射器（HCCR）阵列，该阵列用作选色波长滤光片并在广角处衍射光。角度分辨光谱测量结果表明，通过改变入射角，可以将HCCR阵列衍射光的布拉格峰从460调谐到545nm。 HCCR阵列还基于可见光谱中的旋转角度展示了波长选择性调谐功能。 HCCR投射具有远场旋转特性的全息图像。 HCCR可作为光学温度和相对湿度传感器使用，该传感器产生可见的比色响应，可用于快速诊断。</ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.218,Simple route toward efficient frequency conversion for generation of fully coherent supercontinua in the mid-IR and UV range,通往高效频率的简单途径，可在中红外和紫外范围内生成完全相干的超连续谱 ,"<p>Fiber supercontinua represent light sources of pivotal importance for a wide range of applications, ranging from optical communications to frequency metrology. Although spectra encompassing more than three octaves can be produced, the applicability of such spectra is strongly hampered due to coherence degradation during spectral broadening. Assuming pulse parameters at the cutting edge of currently available laser technology, we demonstrate the possibility of strongly coherent supercontinuum generation. In a fiber with two zero-dispersion wavelengths a higher-order soliton experiences a temporal breakdown, without any compression or splitting behavior, which leads to nearly complete conversion of input solitonic radiation into resonant nonsolitonic radiation in the dispersive wave regime. As the process is completely deterministic and shows little sensitivity to input noise, the resulting pulses appear to be compressible down to the sub-cycle level and may thus hold a new opportunity for direct generation of attosecond pulses in the visible to near ultraviolet wavelength range.</p>",<p>超连续光纤代表了从光通信到频率计量的广泛应用中至关重要的光源。尽管可以产生涵盖三个以上八度音阶的光谱，但由于光谱加宽期间的相干性降低，因此强烈阻碍了此类光谱的适用性。假设脉冲参数处于当前可用激光技术的最前沿，我们证明了产生强相干超连续谱的可能性。在具有两个零色散波长的光纤中，高阶孤子会经历时间击穿，而没有任何压缩或分裂行为，这导致色散波形式中输入孤子辐射几乎完全转换为共振非孤子辐射。由于该过程是完全确定性的，并且对输入噪声几乎没有敏感性，因此所产生的脉冲似乎可以压缩到亚循环水平，因此可能为在可见光到近紫外波长范围内直接生成阿秒脉冲提供了新的机会。 </ p> 
10.1038/lsa.2016.219,Exploiting scattering media for exploring 3D objects,利用散射介质探索3D对象 ,"<p>Scattering media, such as diffused glass and biological tissue, are usually treated as obstacles in imaging. To cope with the random phase introduced by a turbid medium, most existing imaging techniques recourse to either phase compensation by optical means or phase recovery using iterative algorithms, and their applications are often limited to two-dimensional imaging. In contrast, we utilize the scattering medium as an unconventional imaging lens and exploit its lens-like properties for lensless three-dimensional (3D) imaging with diffraction-limited resolution. Our spatially incoherent lensless imaging technique is simple and capable of variable focusing with adjustable depths of focus that enables depth sensing of 3D objects that are concealed by the diffusing medium. Wide-field imaging with diffraction-limited resolution is verified experimentally by a single-shot recording of the 1951 USAF resolution test chart, and 3D imaging and depth sensing are demonstrated by shifting focus over axially separated objects.</p>",<p>散射介质（例如扩散的玻璃和生物组织）通常被视为成像的障碍。为了应对混浊介质引入的随机相位，大多数现有的成像技术都依靠光学手段进行相位补偿或使用迭代算法进行相位恢复，并且它们的应用通常仅限于二维成像。相比之下，我们将散射介质用作非常规成像透镜，并利用其类似透镜的特性进行具有衍射极限分辨率的无透镜三维（3D）成像。我们的空间非相干无透镜成像技术非常简单，并且能够通过可调节的聚焦深度进行可变聚焦，从而能够深度感知被扩散介质掩盖的3D对象。单次记录1951 USAF分辨率测试图通过实验验证了具有衍射极限分辨率的宽视场成像，并通过将焦点移到轴向分离的物体上来演示3D成像和深度感应。</ p>
