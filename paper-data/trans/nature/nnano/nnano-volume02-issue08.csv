10.1038/nnano.2007.223,Immunological properties of engineered nanomaterials,工程纳米材料的免疫学特性 ,"<p>Most research on the toxicology of nanomaterials has focused on the effects of nanoparticles that enter the body accidentally. There has been much less research on the toxicology of nanoparticles that are used for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery or imaging, in which the nanoparticles are deliberately placed in the body. Moreover, there are no harmonized standards for assessing the toxicity of nanoparticles to the immune system (immunotoxicity). Here we review recent research on immunotoxicity, along with data on a range of nanotechnology-based drugs that are at different stages in the approval process. Research shows that nanoparticles can stimulate and/or suppress the immune responses, and that their compatibility with the immune system is largely determined by their surface chemistry. Modifying these factors can significantly reduce the immunotoxicity of nanoparticles and make them useful platforms for drug delivery.</p>",<p>关于纳米材料毒理学的大多数研究都集中在纳米颗粒意外进入人体的影响上。 对用于生物医学应用（例如药物递送或成像）的纳米颗粒的毒理学研究很少，其中纳米颗粒被故意放置在体内。 此外，还没有用于评估纳米颗粒对免疫系统的毒性（免疫毒性）的统一标准。 在这里，我们回顾了有关免疫毒性的最新研究，以及在批准过程中处于不同阶段的一系列基于纳米技术的药物的数据。 研究表明，纳米颗粒可以刺激和/或抑制免疫反应，并且它们与免疫系统的相容性在很大程度上取决于其表面化学性质。 修改这些因子可以显着降低纳米颗粒的免疫毒性，使其成为药物递送的有用平台。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2007.218,Alternating current Josephson effect and resonant superconducting transport through vibrating Nb nanowires,通过振动Nb纳米线的交流约瑟夫森效应和共振超导传输 ,"<p>In 1962, Josephson made a celebrated prediction: when a constant voltage is applied across a thin insulator separating two superconductors, it will generate an oscillating current. These oscillations are ubiquitous in superconducting weak links of various geometries, and analogues have been found in other macroscopic quantum systems, such as superfluids and gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates. The interplay between the oscillating current and external microwave radiation of matching frequency (Shapiro steps) or with internal electrodynamic resonances (Fiske effect) appear as changes in the current&#8211;voltage characteristics of superconducting tunnel junctions and provide further insight into the phenomenon. Here, we report measurements and theoretical studies suggesting that Josephson current oscillations interact with atomic-scale mechanical motion as well. We formed a niobium dimer nanowire that acts as a weak link between two superconducting (bulk) niobium electrodes. We find features in the differential conductance through the dimer which we believe correspond to excitations of the dimer vibrational modes by Josephson oscillations and support our results with theoretical simulations.</p>",<p> 1962年，约瑟夫森做出了一个著名的预测：将恒定电压施加到将两个超导体隔开的薄绝缘体上时，它将产生振荡电流。这些振荡在各种几何形状的超导薄弱环节中无处不在，并且在其他宏观量子系统中也发现了类似物，例如超流体和气态的玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚物。振荡电流与匹配频率的外部微波辐射（Shapiro步长）或内部电动力学共振（Fiske效应）之间的相互作用表现为超导隧道结电流电压特性的变化，并提供了对该现象的进一步了解。在这里，我们报告的测量和理论研究表明约瑟夫森电流振荡也与原子尺度的机械运动相互作用。我们形成了一个铌二聚体纳米线，该纳米线充当两个超导（本体）铌电极之间的弱连接。我们发现通过二聚物产生的微分电导中的特征，我们认为这与约瑟夫森振动激发二聚物振动模式相对应，并通过理论模拟来支持我们的结果。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2007.224,Evaporation and deposition of alkyl-capped silicon nanocrystals in ultrahigh vacuum,超高真空下烷基硅纳米晶的蒸发和沉积 ,"<p>Nanocrystals are under active investigation because of their interesting size-dependent properties and potential applications. Silicon nanocrystals have been studied for possible uses in optoelectronics, and may be relevant to the understanding of natural processes such as lightning strikes. Gas-phase methods can be used to prepare nanocrystals, and mass spectrometric techniques have been used to analyse Au and CdSe clusters. However, it is difficult to study nanocrystals by such methods unless they are synthesized in the gas phase. In particular, pre-prepared nanocrystals are generally difficult to sublime without decomposition. Here we report the observation that films of alkyl-capped silicon nanocrystals evaporate upon heating in ultrahigh vacuum at 200&#160;&#176;C, and the vapour of intact nanocrystals can be collected on a variety of solid substrates. This effect may be useful for the controlled preparation of new quantum-confined silicon structures and could facilitate their mass spectroscopic study and size-selection.</p>",<p>由于其有趣的尺寸依赖性和潜在的应用，纳米晶体正在积极研究中。已经研究了硅纳米晶体在光电子学中的可能用途，并且可能与自然过程（如雷击）的理解有关。气相方法可用于制备纳米晶体，质谱技术已用于分析Au和CdSe团簇。但是，除非通过气相合成纳米晶体，否则很难通过这种方法研究纳米晶体。特别地，预制备的纳米晶体通常难以升华而不分解。在这里，我们报告观察到，在200°C超高真空下加热时，烷基覆盖的硅纳米晶体的薄膜会蒸发，并且完整纳米晶体的蒸气可以收集在各种固体基质上。这种作用可能对控制新的量子受限的硅结构的制备有用，并可能有助于其质谱研究和尺寸选择。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2007.225,An autonomous polymerization motor powered by DNA hybridization,DNA杂交驱动的自主聚合马达 ,"<p>We present a synthetic molecular motor capable of autonomous nanoscale transport in solution. Inspired by bacterial pathogens such as Rickettsia rickettsii, which locomote by inducing the polymerization of the protein actin at their surfaces to form &#8216;comet tails&#8217;, the motor operates by polymerizing a double-helical DNA tail<sup>2</sup>. DNA strands are propelled processively at the living end of the growing polymers, demonstrating autonomous locomotion powered by the free energy of DNA hybridization.</p>",<p>我们提出了一种能够在溶液中进行自主纳米级迁移的合成分子电动机。 受细菌病原体（如立克次氏体（Rickettsia rickettsii））的启发，该病原体通过诱导蛋白质肌动蛋白在其表面形成聚合而形成“彗尾”，该电动机通过聚合双螺旋DNA尾<sup> 2 < / sup>。 DNA链在正在生长的聚合物的活性末端逐步推进，这表明DNA杂交的自由能推动了自主运动。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2007.217,Targeted delivery of magnetic aerosol droplets to the lung,定向将磁性气雾剂液滴输送到肺 ,"<p>The inhalation of medical aerosols is widely used for the treatment of lung disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, respiratory infection and, more recently, lung cancer. Targeted aerosol delivery to the affected lung tissue may improve therapeutic efficiency and minimize unwanted side effects. Despite enormous progress in optimizing aerosol delivery to the lung, targeted aerosol delivery to specific lung regions other than the airways or the lung periphery has not been adequately achieved to date. Here, we show theoretically by computer-aided simulation, and for the first time experimentally in mice, that targeted aerosol delivery to the lung can be achieved with aerosol droplets comprising superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles&#8212;so-called nanomagnetosols&#8212;in combination with a target-directed magnetic gradient field. We suggest that nanomagnetosols may be useful for treating localized lung disease, by targeting foci of bacterial infection or tumour nodules.</p>",<p>医用气雾剂的吸入被广泛用于治疗肺部疾病，例如哮喘，慢性阻塞性肺疾病，囊性纤维化，呼吸道感染，以及最近的肺癌。有针对性地将气雾剂输送到受影响的肺组织可以提高治疗效率并使不良副作用降至最低。尽管在优化向肺部的气雾递送方面取得了巨大进展，但是迄今为止，尚未充分实现向除气道或肺外围以外的特定肺区域的针对性气雾递送。在这里，我们通过计算机辅助模拟从理论上证明了这一点，并且首次在小鼠中进行了实验，这可以通过包含超顺磁性氧化铁纳米颗粒和所谓的纳米磁溶胶组合的气溶胶液滴实现向肺的靶向气溶胶输送。具有目标定向的磁场梯度场。我们建议通过靶向细菌感染或肿瘤结节，纳米磁溶胶可能对治疗局部肺部疾病有用。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2007.227,Assembly of aligned linear metallic patterns on silicon,在硅上组装对齐的线性金属图案 ,"<p>In order to harness the potential of block copolymers to produce nanoscale structures that can be integrated with existing silicon-based technologies, there is a need for compatible chemistries. Block copolymer nanostructures can form a wide variety of two-dimensional patterns, and can be controlled to present long-range order. Here we use the acid-responsive nature of self-assembled monolayers of aligned, horizontal block copolymer cylinders for metal loading with simple aqueous solutions of anionic metal complexes, followed by brief plasma treatment to simultaneously remove the block copolymer and produce metallic nanostructures. Aligned lines of metal with widths on the order of 10&#160;nm and less are efficiently produced by means of this approach on Si(100) interfaces. The method is highly versatile because the chemistry to manipulate nanowire composition, structure and choice of semiconductor is under the control of the user.</p>",<p>为了利用嵌段共聚物生产可与现有基于硅的技术集成的纳米级结构的潜力，需要兼容的化学试剂。 嵌段共聚物纳米结构可以形成各种各样的二维图案，并且可以被控制以呈现远距离有序。 在这里，我们利用排列成水平的嵌段共聚物圆柱体的自组装单层的酸响应特性，用简单的阴离子金属配合物水溶液加载金属，然后进行短暂的等离子体处理，以同时去除嵌段共聚物并产生金属纳米结构。 通过这种方法在Si（100）界面上有效地产生了宽度在10纳米到10纳米或更小的对准线。 该方法具有高度的通用性，因为操纵纳米线组成，结构和半导体选择的化学方法在用户的控制之下。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2007.226,An atomic force microscope tip designed to measure time-varying nanomechanical forces,用于测量时变纳米机械力的原子力显微镜尖端 ,"<p>Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), in which the vibrating tip periodically approaches, interacts and retracts from the sample surface, is the most common AFM imaging method. The tip experiences attractive and repulsive forces that depend on the chemical and mechanical properties of the sample, yet conventional AFM tips are limited in their ability to resolve these time-varying forces. We have created a specially designed cantilever tip that allows these interaction forces to be measured with good (sub-microsecond) temporal resolution and material properties to be determined and mapped in detail with nanoscale spatial resolution. Mechanical measurements based on these force waveforms are provided at a rate of 4&#160;kHz. The forces and contact areas encountered in these measurements are orders of magnitude smaller than conventional indentation and AFM-based indentation techniques that typically provide data rates around 1&#160;Hz. We use this tool to quantify and map nanomechanical changes in a binary polymer blend in the vicinity of its glass transition.</p>",敲击模式原子力显微镜（AFM）是最常见的AFM成像方法，其中振动尖端会周期性地接近，相互作用并从样品表面缩回。吸头受到的吸引力和排斥力取决于样品的化学和机械性能，但是传统的AFM吸头在解决这些时变力方面的能力受到限制。我们创建了一个经过特殊设计的悬臂尖端，该悬臂尖端允许以良好的（亚微秒）时间分辨率测量这些相互作用力，并可以确定材料特性并以纳米级空间分辨率进行详细映射。基于这些力波形的机械测量值以4kHz的速率提供。在这些测量中遇到的力和接触面积比传统的压痕和基于AFM的压痕技术小几个数量级，而传统的压痕和基于AFM的压痕技术通常可提供1 Hz左右的数据速率。我们使用此工具来量化和绘制二元聚合物共混物在其玻璃化转变附近的纳米力学变化。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2007.216,Enhanced fluorescence emission from quantum dots on a photonic crystal surface,光子晶体表面上量子点的增强荧光发射 ,"<p>Colloidal quantum dots display a wide range of novel optical properties that could prove useful for many applications in photonics. Here, we report the enhancement of fluorescence emission from colloidal quantum dots on the surface of two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs. The enhancement is due to a combination of high-intensity near fields and strong coherent scattering effects, which we attribute to leaky eigenmodes of the photonic crystal. By fabricating two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs that operate at visible wavelengths and engineering their leaky modes so that they overlap with the absorption and emission wavelengths of the quantum dots, we demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity can be enhanced by a factor of up to 108 compared with quantum dots on an unpatterned surface.</p>",<p>胶体量子点具有多种新颖的光学特性，可证明对光子学中的许多应用有用。 在这里，我们报告了二维光子晶体平板表面胶态量子点的荧光发射增强。 增强归因于高强度近场和强相干散射效应的结合，我们将其归因于光子晶体的泄漏本征模。 通过制造在可见光波长下工作的二维光子晶体平板并设计其泄漏模式，使其与量子点的吸收和发射波长重叠，我们证明，与之相比，荧光强度最多可以提高108倍 在无图案的表面上具有量子点。</ p>
