10.1038/nnano.2008.83,Large-area ultrathin films of reduced graphene oxide as a transparent and flexible electronic material,氧化石墨烯的大面积超薄膜，作为透明且柔软的电子材料 ,"<p>The integration of novel materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes and nanowires into devices has been challenging, but developments in transfer printing and solution-based methods now allow these materials to be incorporated into large-area electronics. Similar efforts are now being devoted to making the integration of graphene into devices technologically feasible. Here, we report a solution-based method that allows uniform and controllable deposition of reduced graphene oxide thin films with thicknesses ranging from a single monolayer to several layers over large areas. The opto-electronic properties can thus be tuned over several orders of magnitude, making them potentially useful for flexible and transparent semiconductors or semi-metals. The thinnest films exhibit graphene-like ambipolar transistor characteristics, whereas thicker films behave as graphite-like semi-metals. Collectively, our deposition method could represent a route for translating the interesting fundamental properties of graphene into technologically viable devices.</p>",<p>将单壁碳纳米管和纳米线等新型材料集成到设备中一直是一项挑战，但是现在转移印刷和基于解决方案的方法的发展使得这些材料可以被整合到大面积的电子产品中。现在正致力于类似的努力，以使石墨烯集成到技术上可行的装置中。在这里，我们报告了一种基于解决方案的方法，该方法可以均匀且可控制地沉积还原性氧化石墨烯薄膜，其厚度范围从单个单层到大面积的多层。因此，可以将光电特性调整到几个数量级，从而使其对于柔性和透明的半导体或半金属很有用。最薄的膜表现出类似石墨烯的双极晶体管特性，而较厚的膜则表现出像石墨一样的半金属。总的来说，我们的沉积方法代表了将石墨烯有趣的基本特性转化为技术上可行的装置的途径。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.84,Bit storage and bit flip operations in an electromechanical oscillator,机电振荡器中的位存储和位翻转操作 ,"<p>The Parametron was first proposed as a logic-processing system almost 50&#160;years ago. In this approach the two stable phases of an excited harmonic oscillator provide the basis for logic operations. Computer architectures based on LC oscillators were developed for this approach, but high power consumption and difficulties with integration meant that the Parametron was rendered obsolete by the transistor. Here we propose an approach to mechanical logic based on nanoelectromechanical systems that is a variation on the Parametron architecture and, as a first step towards a possible nanomechanical computer, we demonstrate both bit storage and bit flip operations.</p>",<p>将近50年前，Parametron被首次提出是一种逻辑处理系统。 用这种方法，激发谐波振荡器的两个稳定相位为逻辑运算提供了基础。 为此方法开发了基于LC振荡器的计算机体系结构，但是高功耗和集成困难意味着Parametron被晶体管淘汰了。 在这里，我们提出了一种基于纳米机电系统的机械逻辑方法，该方法是对Parametron体系结构的一种变体，作为向可能的纳米机械计算机迈出的第一步，我们演示了位存储和位翻转操作。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.97,Self-regulation of photoinduced electron transfer by a molecular nonlinear transducer,分子非线性换能器对光诱导电子转移的自我调节 ,"<p>Organisms must adapt to survive, necessitating regulation of molecular and subcellular processes. Green plant photosynthesis responds to potentially damaging light levels by downregulating the fraction of excitation energy that drives electron transfer. Achieving adaptive, self-regulating behaviour in synthetic molecules is a critical challenge that must be met if the promises of nanotechnology are to be realized. Here we report a molecular pentad consisting of two light-gathering antennas, a porphyrin electron donor, a fullerene electron acceptor and a photochromic control moiety. At low white-light levels, the molecule undergoes photoinduced electron transfer with a quantum yield of 82%. As the light intensity increases, photoisomerization of the photochrome leads to quenching of the porphyrin excited state, reducing the quantum yield to as low as 27%. This self-regulating molecule modifies its function according to the level of environmental light, mimicking the non-photochemical quenching mechanism for photoprotection found in plants.</p>",<p>有机物必须适应生存，因此必须调节分子和亚细胞过程。绿色植物的光合作用通过下调驱动电子传递的激发能的比例来响应潜在的破坏性光水平。如果要实现纳米技术的承诺，那么在合成分子中实现自适应的，自我调节的行为是必须解决的关键挑战。在这里，我们报告一个分子五单元组，由两个聚光天线，卟啉电子供体，富勒烯电子受体和光致变色控制部分组成。在低白光水平下，分子经历光生电子转移，量子产率为82％。随着光强度的增加，光致色素的光异构化导致卟啉激发态的猝灭，量子产率降低至低至27％。这种自我调节的分子根据环境光的水平来调节其功能，模仿植物中发现的非光化学猝灭机制，以进行光保护。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.99,Mass production and dynamic imaging of fluorescent nanodiamonds,荧光纳米金刚石的量产和动态成像 ,"<p>Fluorescent nanodiamond is a new nanomaterial that possesses several useful properties, including good biocompatibility, excellent photostability and facile surface functionalizability. Moreover, when excited by a laser, defect centres within the nanodiamond emit photons that are capable of penetrating tissue, making them well suited for biological imaging applications. Here, we show that bright fluorescent nanodiamonds can be produced in large quantities by irradiating synthetic diamond nanocrystallites with helium ions. The fluorescence is sufficiently bright and stable to allow three-dimensional tracking of a single particle within the cell by means of either one- or two-photon-excited fluorescence microscopy. The excellent photophysical characteristics are maintained for particles as small as 25&#160;nm, suggesting that fluorescent nanodiamond is an ideal probe for long-term tracking and imaging in vivo, with good temporal and spatial resolution.</p>",<p>荧光纳米金刚石是一种新型纳米材料，具有多种有用的特性，包括良好的生物相容性，优异的光稳定性和便捷的表面功能性。 此外，当被激光激发时，纳米金刚石内部的缺陷中心会发射出能够穿透组织的光子，使其非常适合生物成像应用。 在这里，我们表明，通过用氦离子辐照合成金刚石纳米微晶，可以大量生产明亮的荧光纳米金刚石。 荧光足够明亮且稳定，可以通过单光子或双光子激发的荧光显微镜对细胞内的单个粒子进行三维跟踪。 对于小至25纳米的颗粒，仍保持了优异的光物理特性，这表明荧光纳米金刚石是用于体内长期跟踪和成像的理想探针，具有良好的时空分辨率。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.98,Integrated three-dimensional microelectromechanical devices from processable carbon nanotube wafers,可加工碳纳米管晶片的集成三维微机电装置 ,"<p>In order to be useful as microelectromechanical devices, carbon nanotubes with well-controlled properties and orientations should be made at high density and be placed at predefined locations. We address this challenge by hierarchically assembling carbon nanotubes into closely packed and highly aligned three-dimensional wafer films from which a wide range of complex and three-dimensional nanotube structures were lithographically fabricated. These include carbon nanotube islands on substrates, suspended sheets and beams, and three-dimensional cantilevers, all of which exist as single cohesive units with useful mechanical and electrical properties. Every fabrication step is both parallel and scalable, which makes it easy to further integrate these structures into functional three-dimensional nanodevice systems. Our approach opens up new ways to make economical and scalable devices with unprecedented structural complexity and functionality.</p>",<p>为了用作微机电设备，应以高密度制造具有良好控制的特性和方向的碳纳米管，并将其放置在预定的位置。 我们通过将碳纳米管分层组装成紧密堆积且高度对齐的三维晶片薄膜来解决这一挑战，从该薄膜中光刻加工出各种复杂的三维三维纳米管结构。 这些包括基底上的碳纳米管岛，悬浮的板和梁以及三维悬臂，所有这些都以具有有效机械和电气特性的单个内聚单元的形式存在。 每个制造步骤都是并行且可扩展的，这使得将这些结构进一步集成到功能三维纳米器件系统中变得容易。 我们的方法为制造经济，可扩展的设备提供了前所未有的结构复杂性和功能性的新方法。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.95,Improved nanofabrication through guided transient liquefaction,通过引导的瞬时液化改善纳米加工 ,"<p>A challenge in nanofabrication is to overcome the limitations of various fabrication methods, including defects, line-edge roughness and the minimum size for the feature linewidth. Here we demonstrate a new approach that can remove fabrication defects and improve nanostructures post-fabrication. This method, which we call self-perfection by liquefaction, can significantly reduce the line-edge roughness and, by using a flat plate to guide the process, increase the sidewall slope, flatten the top surface and narrow the width while increasing the height. The technique involves selectively melting nanostructures for a short period of time (hundreds of nanoseconds) while applying a set of boundary conditions to guide the flow of the molten material into the desired geometry before solidification. Using this method we reduced the 3&#963; line-edge roughness of 70-nm-wide chromium grating lines from 8.4&#160;nm to less than 1.5&#160;nm, which is well below the &#8216;red-zone limit&#8217; of 3&#160;nm discussed in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. We also reduced the width of a silicon line from 285&#160;nm to 175&#160;nm, while increasing its height from 50&#160;nm to 90&#160;nm. Self-perfection by liquefaction can also be extended to other metals and semiconductors, dielectrics and large-area wafers.</p>",<p>纳米制造中的挑战是克服各种制造方法的局限性，包括缺陷，线边缘粗糙度和特征线宽的最小尺寸。在这里，我们演示了一种可以消除制造缺陷并改善制造后纳米结构的新方法。这种称为液化的自我完善的方法可以显着降低线边缘的粗糙度，并且通过使用平板引导过程，可以增加侧壁的倾斜度，使顶面变平并使宽度变窄，同时增加高度。该技术涉及在短时间内（数百纳秒）选择性地熔化纳米结构，同时施加一组边界条件以在固化之前将熔融材料的流动引导至所需的几何形状。使用此方法，我们减少了3＆＃963;。 70纳米宽的铬光栅线的线边缘粗糙度从8.4nm到小于1.5nm，远低于“红色区域限制”。在《国际半导体技术路线图》中讨论了3nm的问题。我们还将硅线的宽度从285nm减小到175nm，同时将其高度从50nm增大到90nm。液化的自我完善也可以扩展到其他金属和半导体，电介质和大面积晶片。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.91,Label-free detection of DNA hybridization based on hydration-induced tension in nucleic acid films,基于水合诱导核酸膜中张力的DNA杂交的无标记检测 ,"<p>The properties of water at the nanoscale are crucial in many areas of biology, but the confinement of water molecules in sub-nanometre channels in biological systems has received relatively little attention. Advances in nanotechnology make it possible to explore the role played by water molecules in living systems, potentially leading to the development of ultrasensitive biosensors. Here we show that the adsorption of water by a self-assembled monolayer of single-stranded DNA on a silicon microcantilever can be detected by measuring how the tension in the monolayer changes as a result of hydration. Our approach relies on the microcantilever bending by an amount that depends on the tension in the monolayer. In particular, we find that the tension changes dramatically when the monolayer interacts with either complementary or single mismatched single-stranded DNA targets. Our results suggest that the tension is mainly governed by hydration forces in the channels between the DNA molecules and could lead to the development of a label-free DNA biosensor that can detect single mutations. The technique provides sensitivity in the femtomolar range that is at least two orders of magnitude better than that obtained previously with label-free nanomechanical biosensors and with label-dependent microarrays.</p>",<p>在许多生物学领域中，纳米级水的性质至关重要，但是在生物系统中亚纳米级通道内水分子的限制却很少受到关注。纳米技术的进步使得探索水分子在生物系统中的作用成为可能，从而有可能导致超灵敏生物传感器的发展。在这里我们表明，通过测量单分子层中由于水合作用而引起的张力变化，可以检测到硅微悬臂上单链DNA的自组装单分子层对水的吸附。我们的方法依靠微悬臂梁弯曲，其数量取决于单层中的张力。特别是，我们发现，当单分子层与互补或单个错配的单链DNA靶相互作用时，张力会急剧变化。我们的结果表明，张力主要受DNA分子之间通道中的水合力控制，并可能导致无标记DNA生物传感器的发展，该传感器可检测单个突变。该技术在飞摩尔范围内的灵敏度比以前使用无标记纳米机械生物传感器和依赖标记的微阵列的灵敏度至少高两个数量级。</ p>
