Each motor is highly specialized and carries out a distinct function within the cell. Some have even evolved sophisticated mechanisms to ensure quality control during nanomanufacturing processes, whether to correct errors in biosynthesis or to detect and permit the repair of damaged transport highways. In general, these nanomotors consume chemical energy in order to undergo a series of shape changes that let them interact sequentially with other molecules. Here we review some of the many tasks that biomotors perform and analyse their underlying design principles from an engineering perspective. We also discuss experiments and strategies to integrate biomotors into synthetic environments for applications such as sensing, transport and assembly.</p>",<p>生命系统使用生物纳米马达来构建生命中必不可少的分子，例如DNA和蛋白质，并以时空精度在细胞内运输货物。 每个马达都是高度专业化的，并且在单元内执行独特的功能。 一些公司甚至发展了复杂的机制，以确保在纳米制造过程中进行质量控制，无论是纠正生物合成中的错误还是发现并允许修复受损的运输公路。 通常，这些纳米马达会消耗化学能，以进行一系列形状变化，使其与其他分子顺序相互作用。 在这里，我们回顾了生物电机执行的许多任务中的某些任务，并从工程角度分析了其基本设计原理。 我们还将讨论将生物马达集成到合成环境中以进行传感，运输和组装等应用的实验和策略。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.179,Formation of chiral branched nanowires by the Eshelby Twist,Eshelby Twist形成手性支链纳米线 ,"<p>Manipulating the morphology of inorganic nanostructures, such as their chirality and branching structure, has been actively pursued as a means of controlling their electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Notable examples of chiral inorganic nanostructures include carbon nanotubes, gold multishell nanowires, mesoporous nanowires and helical nanowires. Branched nanostructures have also been studied and been shown to have interesting properties for energy harvesting and nanoelectronics. Combining both chiral and branching motifs into nanostructures might provide new materials properties. Here we show a chiral branched PbSe nanowire structure, which is formed by a vapour&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid branching from a central nanowire with an axial screw dislocation. The chirality is caused by the elastic strain of the axial screw dislocation, which produces a corresponding Eshelby Twist in the nanowires. In addition to opening up new opportunities for tailoring the properties of nanomaterials, these chiral branched nanowires also provide a direct visualization of the Eshelby Twist.</p>",<p>操纵无机纳米结构的形态，例如它们的手性和支化结构，已经成为控制其电学，光学和机械性能的一种积极方法。手性无机纳米结构的显着实例包括碳纳米管，金多壳纳米线，中孔纳米线和螺旋纳米线。还研究了支链纳米结构，并证明其具有用于能量收集和纳米电子学的有趣特性。将手性和分支基序结合到纳米结构中可能会提供新的材料特性。在这里，我们显示了一种手性支化的PbSe纳米线结构，该结构由具有轴向螺旋位错的中心纳米线的蒸气和液体固相形成。手性是由轴向螺钉错位的弹性应变引起的，该应变在纳米线中产生相应的Eshelby Twist。这些手性分支纳米线除了为定制纳米材料的特性提供了新的机会外，还提供了Eshelby Twist的直接可视化。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.178,Ultrasonically driven nanomechanical single-electron shuttle,超声驱动纳米机械单电子梭 ,"<p>The single-electron transistor is the fastest and most sensitive electrometer available today. Single-electron pumps and turnstiles are also being explored as part of the global effort to redefine the ampere in terms of the fundamental physical constants. However, the possibility of electrons tunnelling coherently through these devices, a phenomenon known as co-tunnelling, imposes a fundamental limit on device performance. It has been predicted that it should be possible to completely suppress co-tunnelling in mechanical versions of the single-electron transistor, which would allow mechanical devices to outperform conventional single-electron transistors in many applications. However, the mechanical devices developed so far are fundamentally limited by unwanted interactions with the electrical mechanisms that are used to excite the devices. Here we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by using ultrasonic waves rather than electrical currents as the excitation mechanism, which we demonstrate at low temperatures. This is a significant step towards the development of high-performance devices.</p>",<p>单电子晶体管是当今最快，最灵敏的静电计。单电子泵和旋转栅也正在探索中，这是在基本物理常数方面重新定义安培的全球努力的一部分。但是，电子通过这些器件相干隧穿的可能性（一种称为共通孔现象）对器件性能施加了根本限制。已经预料到，在单电子晶体管的机械版本中应该有可能完全抑制共通，这将使机械设备在许多应用中胜过传统的单电子晶体管。然而，迄今为止开发的机械装置从根本上受到与用于激励装置的电气机构的有害相互作用的限制。在这里，我们表明可以通过使用超声波而不是电流作为激励机制来克服这个问题，这是我们在低温下演示的。这是开发高性能设备的重要一步。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.172,Contact and edge effects in graphene devices,石墨烯器件中的接触和边缘效应 ,"<p>Electrical transport studies on graphene have been focused mainly on the linear dispersion region around the Fermi level and, in particular, on the effects associated with the quasiparticles in graphene behaving as relativistic particles known as Dirac fermions. However, some theoretical work has suggested that several features of electron transport in graphene are better described by conventional semiconductor physics. Here we use scanning photocurrent microscopy to explore the impact of electrical contacts and sheet edges on charge transport through graphene devices. The photocurrent distribution reveals the presence of potential steps that act as transport barriers at the metal contacts. Modulations in the electrical potential within the graphene sheets are also observed. Moreover, we find that the transition from the p- to n-type regime induced by electrostatic gating does not occur homogeneously within the sheets. Instead, at low carrier densities we observe the formation of p-type conducting edges surrounding a central n-type channel.</p>",石墨烯的电输运研究主要集中在费米能级附近的线性弥散区域，特别是与石墨烯中准粒子的相对论行为有关，即狄拉克费米子相对论粒子。但是，一些理论工作表明，常规半导体物理学可以更好地描述石墨烯中电子传输的几个特征。在这里，我们使用扫描光电流显微镜来研究电触点和薄板边缘对通过石墨烯器件的电荷传输的影响。光电流分布揭示了潜在台阶的存在，这些台阶充当金属触点处的传输势垒。还观察到石墨烯片内电势的调节。此外，我们发现由静电门控引起的从p型到n型态的转变在片材内不会均匀地发生。相反，在低载流子密度下，我们观察到围绕中心n型沟道的p型导电边缘的形成。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.199,Approaching ballistic transport in suspended graphene,悬浮石墨烯中的弹道输运 ,"<p>The discovery of graphene raises the prospect of a new class of nanoelectronic devices based on the extraordinary physical properties of this one-atom-thick layer of carbon. Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000&#160;cm<sup>2</sup>&#160;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> for carrier densities below 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>9</sup>&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a substrate, the conductivity of suspended graphene at the Dirac point is strongly dependent on temperature and approaches ballistic values at liquid helium temperatures. At higher temperatures, above 100&#160;K, we observe the onset of thermally induced long-range scattering.</p>","<p>石墨烯的发现基于这种单原子厚的碳层的非凡物理特性，为新型纳米电子器件的发展提供了前景。与半导体中的二维电子层不同，在二维电子层中，载流子在低密度下无法移动，石墨烯中的载流子迁移率可以保持很高，即使其密度在狄拉克点消失。但是，当将石墨烯样品支撑在绝缘基板上时，电位波动会引起电荷坑，从而使狄拉克点物理变得模糊。在这里，我们显示出悬浮石墨烯样品中的波动显着降低，并且我们报告的低温迁移率接近200,000＆＃160; cm <sup> 2 </ sup>＆＃160; V <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>＆＃160; s <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>适用于低于5＆＃160;＆＃215;＆＃160; 10 <sup> 9 </ sup>＆＃160; cm < sup>＆＃8722; 2 </ sup>。在半导体或非悬浮石墨烯中无法获得这样的值。此外，与衬底支撑的石墨烯样品不同，在狄拉克点的悬浮石墨烯的电导率在很大程度上取决于温度，并且在液氦温度下接近弹道值。在100 K以上的较高温度下，我们观察到了热诱导的远距离散射的发生。</ p> "
10.1038/nnano.2008.173,Ultrasensitive hot-electron nanobolometers for terahertz astrophysics,太赫兹天体物理学的超灵敏热电子纳米测辐射热计 ,"<p>The submillimetre or terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum contains approximately half of the total luminosity of the Universe and 98% of all the photons emitted since the Big Bang. This radiation is strongly absorbed in the Earth's atmosphere, so space-based terahertz telescopes are crucial for exploring the evolution of the Universe. Thermal emission from the primary mirrors in these telescopes can be reduced below the level of the cosmic background by active cooling, which expands the range of faint objects that can be observed. However, it will also be necessary to develop bolometers&#8212;devices for measuring the energy of electromagnetic radiation&#8212;with sensitivities that are at least two orders of magnitude better than the present state of the art. To achieve this sensitivity without sacrificing operating speed, two conditions are required. First, the bolometer should be exceptionally well thermally isolated from the environment; second, its heat capacity should be sufficiently small. Here we demonstrate that these goals can be achieved by building a superconducting hot-electron nanobolometer. Its design eliminates the energy exchange between hot electrons and the leads by blocking electron outdiffusion and photon emission. The thermal conductance between hot electrons and the thermal bath, controlled by electron&#8211;phonon interactions, becomes very small at low temperatures (&#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;16</sup>&#160;W&#160;K<sup>&#8722;1</sup> at 40 mK). These devices, with a heat capacity of &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;19</sup>&#160;J&#160;K<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, are sufficiently sensitive to detect single terahertz photons in submillimetre astronomy and other applications based on quantum calorimetry and photon counting.</p>",<p>电磁光谱的亚毫米或太赫兹区域包含宇宙总光度的一半，以及自大爆炸以来发射的所有光子的98％。这种辐射在地球大气中被强烈吸收，因此天基太赫兹望远镜对于探索宇宙的发展至关重要。通过主动冷却，可以将这些望远镜的主镜发出的热量降低到宇宙背景水平以下，从而扩大了可以观察到的微弱物体的范围。但是，也有必要开发测辐射热仪和/或用于测量电磁辐射能量的装置，其灵敏度至少比现有技术高两个数量级。为了在不牺牲工作速度的情况下达到这种灵敏度，需要两个条件。首先，测辐射热计应与环境格外良好地热隔离；第二，其热容量应足够小。在这里，我们证明了通过构建超导热电子纳米测辐射热仪可以实现这些目标。它的设计通过阻止电子向外扩散和光子发射，消除了热电子与引线之间的能量交换。受电子声子相互作用控制的热电子与热浴之间的热导率在低温下变得很小（＆＃8764; 1＆＃215; 10 <sup>＆＃8722; 16 </ sup>＆ ＃160; W＆＃160; K <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>在40 mK时）。这些设备的热容为＆＃8764; 1＆＃215; 10 <sup>＆＃8722; 19 </ sup>＆＃160; J＆＃160; K <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>具有足够的灵敏度，可以检测亚毫米天文学和其他基于应用的单太赫兹光子量热法和光子计数的研究。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.162,Imaging nanoparticles in cells by nanomechanical holography,通过纳米机械全息术成像细胞中的纳米颗粒 ,"<p>Nanomaterials have potential medical applications, for example in the area of drug delivery, and their possible adverse effects and cytotoxicity are curently receiving attention. Inhalation of nanoparticles is of great concern, because nanoparticles can be easily aerosolized. Imaging techniques that can visualize local populations of nanoparticles at nanometre resolution within the structures of cells are therefore important. Here we show that cells obtained from mice exposed to single-walled carbon nanohorns can be probed using a scanning probe microscopy technique called scanning near field ultrasonic holography. The nanohorns were observed inside the cells, and this was further confirmed using micro Raman spectroscopy. Scanning near field ultrasonic holography is a useful technique for probing the interactions of engineered nanomaterials in biological systems, which will greatly benefit areas in drug delivery and nanotoxicology.</p>",纳米材料具有潜在的医学应用，例如在药物输送领域，其可能的不良作用和细胞毒性正在受到关注。 纳米颗粒的吸入非常令人关注，因为纳米颗粒易于雾化。 因此，可以在细胞结构内以纳米分辨率可视化纳米粒子局部种群的成像技术非常重要。 在这里，我们显示可以使用称为“扫描近场超声全息扫描”的扫描探针显微镜技术探测从暴露于单壁碳纳米角的小鼠获得的细胞。 在细胞内部观察到了纳米角，并使用显微拉曼光谱进一步证实了这一点。 扫描近场超声全息术是探测工程纳米材料在生物系统中相互作用的有用技术，这将大大有利于药物输送和纳米毒理学领域。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.188,Formation and enhanced biocidal activity of water-dispersable organic nanoparticles,水分散性有机纳米粒子的形成及其增强的杀菌活性 ,"<p>Water-insoluble organic compounds are often used in aqueous environments in various pharmaceutical and consumer products. To overcome insolubility, the particles are dispersed in a medium during product formation, but large particles that are formed may affect product performance and safety. Many techniques have been used to produce nanodispersions&#8212;dispersions with nanometre-scale dimensions&#8212;that have properties similar to solutions. However, making nanodispersions requires complex processing, and it is difficult to achieve stability over long periods. Here we report a generic method for producing organic nanoparticles with a combination of modified emulsion-templating and freeze-drying. The dry powder composites formed using this method are highly porous, stable and form nanodispersions upon simple addition of water. Aqueous nanodispersions of Triclosan (a commercial antimicrobial agent) produced with this approach show greater activity than organic/aqueous solutions of Triclosan.</p>",水不溶性有机化合物通常在水性环境中用于各种药品和消费品中。为了克服不溶性，颗粒在产品形成过程中分散在介质中，但是形成的大颗粒可能会影响产品性能和安全性。已经使用了许多技术来生产具有纳米级尺寸的纳米分散体，其性质类似于溶液。然而，制备纳米分散体需要复杂的处理，并且难以长期稳定。在这里，我们报告了一种结合改性乳液模板和冷冻干燥生产有机纳米颗粒的通用方法。用这种方法形成的干粉复合材料是高度多孔的，稳定的，并且在简单添加水后形成纳米分散体。用这种方法生产的三氯生（一种商用抗菌剂）的纳米水分散体比三氯生的有机/水溶液具有更高的活性。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.168,Engineered elastomeric proteins with dual elasticity can be controlled by a molecular regulator,具有双重弹性的工程弹性蛋白可以通过分子调节剂控制 ,"<p>Elastomeric proteins are molecular springs that confer excellent mechanical properties to many biological tissues and biomaterials. Depending on the role performed by the tissue or biomaterial, elastomeric proteins can behave as molecular springs or shock absorbers. Here we combine single-molecule atomic force microscopy and protein engineering techniques to create elastomeric proteins that can switch between two distinct types of mechanical behaviour in response to the binding of a molecular regulator. The proteins are mechanically labile by design and behave as entropic springs with an elasticity that is governed by their configurational entropy. However, when a molecular regulator binds to the protein, it switches into a mechanically stable state and can act as a shock absorber. These engineered proteins effectively mimic and combine the two extreme forms of elastic behaviour found in natural elastomeric proteins, and thus represent a new type of smart nanomaterial that will find potential applications in nanomechanics and material sciences.</p>",<p>弹性蛋白是赋予许多生物组织和生物材料优异机械性能的分子弹簧。取决于组织或生物材料所发挥的作用，弹性蛋白可以充当分子弹簧或减震器。在这里，我们结合单分子原子力显微镜和蛋白质工程技术来创建弹性体蛋白，这些蛋白可以响应分子调节剂的结合而在两种不同类型的机械行为之间切换。这些蛋白质在设计上在机械上不稳定，并表现为熵弹簧，其弹性受其构型熵支配。但是，当分子调节剂与蛋白质结合时，它会转换为机械稳定状态，并可以用作减震器。这些工程蛋白有效地模拟并结合了天然弹性体蛋白中发现的两种极端形式的弹性行为，从而代表了一种新型的智能纳米材料，它将在纳米力学和材料科学中找到潜在的应用。</ p>
