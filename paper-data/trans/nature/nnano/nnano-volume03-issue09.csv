10.1038/nnano.2008.200,An atomic-resolution nanomechanical mass sensor,原子分辨率纳米机械质量传感器 ,"<p>Mechanical resonators are widely used as inertial balances to detect small quantities of adsorbed mass through shifts in oscillation frequency. Advances in lithography and materials synthesis have enabled the fabrication of nanoscale mechanical resonators, which have been operated as precision force, position and mass sensors. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature, carbon-nanotube-based nanomechanical resonator with atomic mass resolution. This device is essentially a mass spectrometer with a mass sensitivity of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>&#8722;25</sup>&#160;kg&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> or, equivalently, 0.40&#160;gold atoms Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>. Using this extreme mass sensitivity, we observe atomic mass shot noise, which is analogous to the electronic shot noise measured in many semiconductor experiments. Unlike traditional mass spectrometers, nanomechanical mass spectrometers do not require the potentially destructive ionization of the test sample, are more sensitive to large molecules, and could eventually be incorporated on a chip.</p>",机械谐振器被广泛用作惯性平衡，以通过振荡频率的变化来检测少量的吸附质量。光刻技术和材料合成技术的进步已使制造纳米级机械谐振器成为可能，这些谐振器已用作精密力，位置和质量传感器。在这里，我们演示了具有原子质量分辨率的室温，基于碳纳米管的纳米机械谐振器。该设备本质上是质谱仪，其质量灵敏度为1.3＆＃160;＆＃215;＆＃160; 10 <sup>＆＃8722; 25 </ sup>＆＃160; kg＆＃160; Hz <sup> ＆＃8722; 1/2 </ sup>或等效地为0.40＆＃160;金原子Hz <sup>＆＃8722; 1/2 </ sup>。使用这种极高的质量敏感度，我们观察到原子质量散粒噪声，类似于许多半导体实验中测得的电子散粒噪声。与传统质谱仪不同，纳米机械质谱仪不需要测试样品的潜在破坏性电离，对大分子更敏感，并且最终可以整合到芯片上。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.210,Highly conducting graphene sheets and Langmuir–Blodgett films,高导电石墨烯片和Langmuir-Blodgett膜 ,"<p>Graphene is an intriguing material with properties that are distinct from those of other graphitic systems. The first samples of pristine graphene were obtained by &#8216;peeling off&#8217; and epitaxial growth. Recently, the chemical reduction of graphite oxide was used to produce covalently functionalized single-layer graphene oxide. However, chemical approaches for the large-scale production of highly conducting graphene sheets remain elusive. Here, we report that the exfoliation&#8211;reintercalation&#8211;expansion of graphite can produce high-quality single-layer graphene sheets stably suspended in organic solvents. The graphene sheets exhibit high electrical conductance at room and cryogenic temperatures. Large amounts of graphene sheets in organic solvents are made into large transparent conducting films by Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett assembly in a layer-by-layer manner. The chemically derived, high-quality graphene sheets could lead to future scalable graphene devices.</p>",<p>石墨烯是一种有趣的材料，其性能与其他石墨系统不同。 原始石墨烯的第一批样品是通过“剥离”获得的。 和外延生长。 最近，氧化石墨的化学还原被用于生产共价官能化的单层氧化石墨烯。 然而，用于大规模生产高导电石墨烯片的化学方法仍然难以捉摸。 在这里，我们报道了石墨的剥离/再嵌入/膨胀可以生产稳定悬浮在有机溶剂中的高质量单层石墨烯片。 石墨烯片在室温和低温下显示出高电导率。 通过Langmuir Blodgett组件以分层的方式将有机溶剂中大量的石墨烯片制成大的透明导电膜。 化学衍生的高质量石墨烯片可能会导致未来可扩展的石墨烯器件。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.206,Nanoparticle-assisted high photoconductive gain in composites of polymer and fullerene,聚合物和富勒烯复合材料中的纳米粒子辅助的高光电导增益 ,"<p>Polymer&#8211;inorganic nanocrystal composites offer an attractive means to combine the merits of organic and inorganic materials into novel electronic and photonic systems. However, many applications of these composites are limited by the solubility and distribution of the nanocrystals in the polymer matrices. Here we show that blending CdTe nanoparticles into a polymer&#8211;fullerene matrix followed by solvent annealing can achieve high photoconductive gain under low applied voltages. The surface capping ligand renders the nanoparticles highly soluble in the polymer blend, thereby enabling high CdTe loadings. An external quantum efficiency as high as &#8764;8,000% at 350 nm was achieved at &#8722;4.5 V. Hole-dominant devices coupled with atomic force microscopy images show a higher concentration of nanoparticles near the cathode&#8211;polymer interface. The nanoparticles and trapped electrons assist hole injection into the polymer under reverse bias, contributing to efficiency values in excess of 100%.</p>","聚合物无机纳米晶体复合材料提供了一种有吸引力的方法，可以将有机和无机材料的优点结合到新颖的电子和光子系统中。但是，这些复合材料的许多应用受到纳米晶体在聚合物基质中的溶解度和分布的限制。在这里，我们表明将CdTe纳米粒子混合到聚合物富勒烯基质中，然后进行溶剂退火可以在低施加电压下实现高光电导增益。表面封盖配体使纳米颗粒高度溶于聚合物共混物中，从而实现了高CdTe负载。在4.5V下在350 nm处达到了高达8,000％的外部量子效率。纳米粒子和捕获的电子在反向偏压下协助空穴注入聚合物，从而使效率值超过100％。</ p> "
10.1038/nnano.2008.189,Control of enhanced Raman scattering using a DNA-based assembly process of dye-coded nanoparticles,使用基于DNA的染料编码纳米颗粒组装过程控制增强的拉曼散射 ,"<p>Enhanced Raman scattering from metal surfaces has been investigated for over 30 years. Silver surfaces are known to produce a large effect, and this can be maximized by producing a roughened surface, which can be achieved by the aggregation of silver nanoparticles. However, an approach to control this aggregation, in particular through the interaction of biological molecules such as DNA, has not been reported. Here we show the selective turning on of the surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering effect on dye-coded, DNA-functionalized, silver nanoparticles through a target-dependent, sequence-specific DNA hybridization assembly that exploits the electromagnetic enhancement mechanism for the scattering. Dye-coded nanoparticles that do not undergo hybridization experience no enhancement and hence do not give surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering. This is due to the massive difference in enhancement from nanoparticle assemblies compared with individual nanoparticles. The electromagnetic enhancement is the dominant effect and, coupled with an understanding of the surface chemistry, allows surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering nanosensors to be designed based on a natural biological recognition process.</p>",<p>增强的金属表面拉曼散射已经研究了30多年。已知银表面会产生很大的效果，并且可以通过产生粗糙的表面来最大化这种效果，这可以通过银纳米颗粒的聚集来实现。然而，尚未报道过控制这种聚集的方法，特别是通过诸如DNA之类的生物分子的相互作用来控制聚集的方法。在这里，我们展示了通过目标依赖的，序列特异性的DNA杂交组件对染料编码的，DNA官能化的银纳米颗粒的表面增强共振拉曼散射效应的选择性开启，该机制利用了散射的电磁增强机制。未进行杂交的染料编码纳米粒子没有增强，因此不会产生表面增强的共振拉曼散射。这是由于与单个纳米颗粒相比，纳米颗粒组件在增强方面的巨大差异。电磁增强是主要作用，加上对表面化学的理解，可以基于自然的生物识别过程设计表面增强共振拉曼散射纳米传感器。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.216,Quantum-dot-assisted characterization of microtubule rotations during cargo transport,货物运输过程中微管旋转的量子点辅助表征 ,"<p>Owing to their wide spectrum of in vivo functions, motor proteins, such as kinesin-1, show great potential for application as nanomachines in engineered environments. When attached to a substrate surface, these motors are envisioned to shuttle cargo that is bound to reconstituted microtubules&#8212;one component of the cell cytoskeleton&#8212;from one location to another. One potentially serious problem for such applications is, however, the rotation of the microtubules around their longitudinal axis. Here we explore this issue by labelling the gliding microtubules with quantum dots to simultaneously follow their sinusoidal side-to-side and up-and-down motion in three dimensions with nanometre accuracy. Microtubule rotation, which originates from the kinesin moving along the individual protofilaments of the microtubule, was not impeded by the quantum dots. However, pick-up of large cargo inhibited the rotation but did not affect the velocity of microtubule gliding. Our data show that kinesin-driven microtubules make flexible, responsive and effective molecular shuttles for nanotransport applications.</p>",<p>由于其广泛的体内功能，运动蛋白（例如kinesin-1）显示出在工程环境中用作纳米机器的巨大潜力。当附着到基底表面上时，这些电动机被设想为将结合到重构的微管上的货物从一个位置移动到细胞骨架的一个位置。然而，对于这种应用，一个潜在的严重问题是微管围绕其纵轴的旋转。在这里，我们通过用量子点标记滑动微管，以纳米精度同时在三个维度上同时跟随其正弦形的左右和上下运动来探索这个问题。由驱动蛋白沿着微管的各个原丝移动的微管旋转不受量子点的阻碍。但是，大件货物的提起抑制了旋转，但没有影响微管滑行的速度。我们的数据表明，驱动蛋白驱动的微管可为纳米运输应用提供灵活，反应灵敏和有效的分子穿梭。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.231,Carbon nanotubes as photoacoustic molecular imaging agents in living mice,碳纳米管作为活体小鼠的光声分子成像剂 ,"<p>Photoacoustic imaging of living subjects offers higher spatial resolution and allows deeper tissues to be imaged compared with most optical imaging techniques. As many diseases do not exhibit a natural photoacoustic contrast, especially in their early stages, it is necessary to administer a photoacoustic contrast agent. A number of contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging have been suggested previously, but most were not shown to target a diseased site in living subjects. Here we show that single-walled carbon nanotubes conjugated with cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides can be used as a contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging of tumours. Intravenous administration of these targeted nanotubes to mice bearing tumours showed eight times greater photoacoustic signal in the tumour than mice injected with non-targeted nanotubes. These results were verified ex vivo using Raman microscopy. Photoacoustic imaging of targeted single-walled carbon nanotubes may contribute to non-invasive cancer imaging and monitoring of nanotherapeutics in living subjects.</p>",<p>与大多数光学成像技术相比，活体对象的光声成像可提供更高的空间分辨率，并使更深的组织成像。由于许多疾病没有表现出自然的光声对比，尤其是在早期阶段，因此有必要使用光声对比剂。先前已经提出了许多用于光声成像的造影剂，但是没有显示大多数造影剂靶向活体受试者的患病部位。在这里，我们显示与环状Arg-Gly-Asp（RGD）肽缀合的单壁碳纳米管可用作肿瘤光声成像的造影剂。这些靶向纳米管对荷瘤小鼠的静脉内给药显示，其肿瘤中的光声信号比注射非靶向纳米管的小鼠高八倍。使用拉曼显微镜离体验证了这些结果。靶向单壁碳纳米管的光声成像可能有助于无创性癌症成像和活体受试者纳米治疗的监测。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.215,High-yield production of graphene by liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite,通过石墨的液相剥落高产石墨烯 ,"<p>Fully exploiting the properties of graphene will require a method for the mass production of this remarkable material. Two main routes are possible: large-scale growth or large-scale exfoliation. Here, we demonstrate graphene dispersions with concentrations up to &#8764;0.01 mg ml<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, produced by dispersion and exfoliation of graphite in organic solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone. This is possible because the energy required to exfoliate graphene is balanced by the solvent&#8211;graphene interaction for solvents whose surface energies match that of graphene. We confirm the presence of individual graphene sheets by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. Our method results in a monolayer yield of &#8764;1 wt%, which could potentially be improved to 7&#8211;12 wt% with further processing. The absence of defects or oxides is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron, infrared and Raman spectroscopies. We are able to produce semi-transparent conducting films and conducting composites. Solution processing of graphene opens up a range of potential large-area applications, from device and sensor fabrication to liquid-phase chemistry.</p>",<p>充分利用石墨烯的特性将需要一种大规模生产这种非凡材料的方法。可能有两种主要途径：大规模增长或大规模剥落。在这里，我们演示了石墨烯分散体，其浓度高达≤0.01mg ml <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>，该分散体是通过在有机溶剂（例如N-甲基-吡咯烷酮）中分散和剥落石墨制成的。这是可能的，因为剥脱石墨烯所需的能量由表面能与石墨烯相匹配的溶剂的溶剂与石墨烯相互作用所平衡。我们通过拉曼光谱，透射电子显微镜和电子衍射确认了单个石墨烯片的存在。我们的方法产生的单层产率为＆＃8764; 1 wt％，可以通过进一步处理将其提高到7＆＃8211; 12 wt％。通过X射线光电子，红外和拉曼光谱学证实没有缺陷或氧化物。我们能够生产半透明导电膜和导电复合材料。石墨烯的固溶处理开辟了从设备和传感器制造到液相化学的一系列潜在的大面积应用。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.237,Molecular junctions based on aromatic coupling,基于芳族偶联的分子连接 ,"<p>If individual molecules are to be used as building blocks for electronic devices, it will be essential to understand charge transport at the level of single molecules. Most existing experiments rely on the synthesis of functional rod-like molecules with chemical linker groups at both ends to provide strong, covalent anchoring to the source and drain contacts. This approach has proved very successful, providing quantitative measures of single-molecule conductance, and demonstrating rectification and switching at the single-molecule level. However, the influence of intermolecular interactions on the formation and operation of molecular junctions has been overlooked. Here we report the use of oligo-phenylene ethynylene molecules as a model system, and establish that molecular junctions can still form when one of the chemical linker groups is displaced or even fully removed. Our results demonstrate that aromatic &#960;&#8722;&#960; coupling between adjacent molecules is efficient enough to allow for the controlled formation of molecular bridges between nearby electrodes.</p>",<p>如果要将单个分子用作电子设备的构建基块，则必须了解单分子水平的电荷传输。现有的大多数实验都依赖于在两端带有化学连接基团的功能杆状分子的合成，以提供牢固的共价锚定至源极和漏极触点。这种方法已被证明非常成功，它提供了单分子电导的定量测量方法，并展示了在单分子水平上的整流和转换。然而，分子间相互作用对分子连接的形成和操作的影响已被忽略。在这里，我们报告了低聚亚苯基乙炔分子作为模型系统的使用，并确定当化学连接基团之一被置换甚至完全去除时，分子连接仍然可以形成。我们的结果表明，芳香族＆＃960;＆＃8722;＆＃960;相邻分子之间的偶联足够有效，可以控制相邻电极之间分子桥的形成。</ p>
