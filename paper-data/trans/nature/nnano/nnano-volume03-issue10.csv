10.1038/nnano.2008.262,Borosilicate nanoparticles prepared by exothermic phase separation,通过放热相分离制备的硼硅酸盐纳米颗粒 ,"<p>Nanoparticles play an important role in chemical and biological sciences due to their ability to bind and concentrate many molecules on their surface. Polymers and silica are widely used to make nanoparticles, but efforts to make nanoparticles from borosilicate glass&#8212;which exhibits high tolerance to chemicals and solvents, combined with excellent mechanical and thermal stability&#8212;have proved unsuccessful. Here we show that borosilicate nanoparticles (100&#8211;500&#160;nm in size) can be synthesized by simply mixing a silicon&#8211;boron binary oxide solution, prepared using non-aqueous organic solvents, with water. This induces a vigorous exothermic phase separation in which borosilicate nanoparticles burst out of a silica phase. In addition to potential applications in the life sciences, monodisperse borosilicate particles could also have applications in the production of photonic bandgap devices with high optical contrast, contrast agents for ultrasonic microscopy or chemical filtration membranes.</p>",<p>由于纳米粒子能够在其表面上结合并浓缩许多分子，因此它们在化学和生物科学中起着重要的作用。聚合物和二氧化硅被广泛用于制造纳米颗粒，但是用硼硅酸盐玻璃制造纳米颗粒的努力却证明是不成功的。在这里，我们显示出硼硅酸盐纳米粒子（尺寸为100＆＃8211; 500＆＃160; nm）可以通过简单地混合使用非水有机溶剂制备的硅硼二氧化硼溶液和水来合成。这引起剧烈的放热相分离，其中硼硅酸盐纳米颗粒从二氧化硅相中爆裂。除了在生命科学中的潜在应用外，单分散硼硅酸盐颗粒还可用于生产具有高光学对比度的光子带隙器件，用于超声显微镜的造影剂或化学滤膜。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.263,Imaging the passage of a single hydrocarbon chain through a nanopore,对单个烃链通过纳米孔的通道进行成像 ,"<p>Molecular transport through nanoscale pores in films, membranes and wall structures is of fundamental importance in a number of physical, chemical and biological processes. However, there is a lack of experimental methods that can obtain information on the structure and orientation of the molecules as they pass through the pore, and their interactions with the pore during passage. Imaging with a transmission electron microscope is a powerful method for studying structural changes in single molecules as they move and for imaging molecules confined inside carbon nanotubes. Here, we report that such imaging can be used to observe the structure and orientation of a hydrocarbon chain as it passes through nanoscale defects in the walls of a single-walled carbon nanotube to the vacuum outside, and also to study the interactions between the chain and the nanopore. Based on experiments at 293&#160;K and 4&#160;K we conclude that the major energy source for the molecular motions observed at 4&#160;K is the electron beam used for the imaging.</p>",在许多物理，化学和生物过程中，通过膜，膜和壁结构中纳米级孔的分子运输至关重要。然而，缺乏能够获得关于分子在通过孔时的结构和取向以及在通过过程中它们与孔的相互作用的信息的实验方法。用透射电子显微镜成像是研究单分子移动过程中结构变化以及对限制在碳纳米管内部的分子成像的有效方法。在这里，我们报道这种成像可用于观察碳氢化合物链通过单壁碳纳米管壁上的纳米级缺陷到达外部真空时的结构和取向，也可用于研究碳链之间的相互作用和纳米孔。根据在293＆＃160; K和4＆＃160; K进行的实验，我们得出结论，在4＆＃160; K观察到的分子运动的主要能源是用于成像的电子束。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.246,Direct observation of chemical reactions on single gold nanocrystals using surface plasmon spectroscopy,使用表面等离激元光谱直接观察单个金纳米晶体上的化学反应 ,"<p>Heterogeneous catalysts have been pivotal to the development of the modern chemical industry and are essential for catalysing many industrial reactions. However, reaction rates are different for every individual catalyst particle and depend upon each particle's morphology and size, crystal structure and composition. Measuring the rates of reaction on single nanocrystals will enable the role of catalyst structure to be quantified. Here, using surface plasmon spectroscopy, we have directly observed the kinetics of atomic deposition onto a single gold nanocrystal and also monitored electron injection and extraction during a redox reaction involving the oxidation of ascorbic acid on a gold nanocrystal surface. These results constitute the first direct measurement of the rates of redox catalysis on single nanocrystals.</p>",<p>非均相催化剂对于现代化学工业的发展至关重要，对于催化许多工业反应至关重要。 然而，对于每个单独的催化剂颗粒，反应速率是不同的，并且取决于每个颗粒的形态和尺寸，晶体结构和组成。 测量在单个纳米晶体上的反应速率将使催化剂结构的作用得以量化。 在这里，我们使用表面等离子体激元光谱法，直接观察了原子沉积到单个金纳米晶体上的动力学，并且还监控了涉及抗坏血酸在金纳米晶体表面氧化的氧化还原反应期间的电子注入和萃取。 这些结果是对单个纳米晶体上氧化还原催化速率的直接测量。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.267,CMOS-compatible fabrication of room-temperature single-electron devices,室温单电子器件的CMOS兼容制造 ,"<p>Devices in which the transport and storage of single electrons are systematically controlled could lead to a new generation of nanoscale devices and sensors. The attractive features of these devices include operation at extremely low power, scalability to the sub-nanometre regime and extremely high charge sensitivity. However, the fabrication of single-electron devices requires nanoscale geometrical control, which has limited their fabrication to small numbers of devices at a time, significantly restricting their implementation in practical devices. Here we report the parallel fabrication of single-electron devices, which results in multiple, individually addressable, single-electron devices that operate at room temperature. This was made possible using CMOS fabrication technology and implementing self-alignment of the source and drain electrodes, which are vertically separated by thin dielectric films. We demonstrate clear Coulomb staircase/blockade and Coulomb oscillations at room temperature and also at low temperatures.</p>",<p>对单个电子的传输和存储进行系统控制的设备可能会导致新一代纳米级设备和传感器。这些设备的吸引人的功能包括以极低的功率工作，可达到亚纳米级的可扩展性以及极高的充电灵敏度。但是，单电子器件的制造需要纳米级的几何控制，这限制了它们一次只能制造少量器件，这严重限制了它们在实际器件中的实现。在这里，我们报告了单电子器件的并行制造，这导致在室温下运行的多个可单独寻址的单电子器件。使用CMOS制造技术并实现源电极和漏电极的自对准成为可能，这些电极由薄介电膜垂直分隔。我们在室温和低温下都表现出清晰的库仑阶梯/阻塞和库仑振荡。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.241,"A microcavity-controlled, current-driven, on-chip nanotube emitter at infrared wavelengths",微腔控制，电流驱动的片上纳米管红外波长发射器 ,"<p>Recent studies of the optical properties of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes suggest that these truly nanometre-scale systems have a promising future in nanophotonics, in addition to their well-known potential in electronics. Semiconducting single-walled nanotubes have a direct, diameter-dependent bandgap and can be excited readily by current injection, which makes them attractive as nano-emitters. The electroluminescence is spectrally broad, spatially non-directional, and the radiative yield is low. Here we report the monolithic integration of a single, electrically excited, semiconducting nanotube transistor with a planar &#955;/2 microcavity, thus taking an important first step in the development of nanotube-based nanophotonic devices. The spectral full-width at half-maximum of the emission is reduced from &#8764;300 to &#8764;40 nm at a cavity resonance of 1.75 &#181;m, and the emission becomes highly directional. The maximum enhancement of the radiative rate is estimated to be 4. We also show that both the optically and electrically excited luminescence of single-walled nanotubes involve the same E<sub>11</sub> excitonic transition.</p>",<p>对半导体单壁碳纳米管的光学特性的最新研究表明，这些真正的纳米级系统除了在电子领域具有众所周知的潜力外，在纳米光子学中还具有广阔的前景。半导体单壁纳米管具有直接的，取决于直径的带隙，可以通过电流注入容易地激发，这使其成为纳米发射体具有吸引力。电致发光在光谱上是宽泛的，在空间上是非定向的，并且辐射产率低。在这里，我们报告了具有平面＆＃955; / 2微腔的单个电激发半导体纳米管晶体管的单片集成，因此在开发基于纳米管的纳米光子器件方面迈出了重要的第一步。在1.75μm的腔谐振下，发射的半峰处的光谱全宽从约300nm减小到约40nm，并且发射变为高度定向的。辐射速率的最大增强估计为4。我们还表明，单壁纳米管的光激发和电激发发光都涉及相同的E <sub> 11 </ sub>激子跃迁。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.232,Patterning of light-emitting conjugated polymer nanofibres,发光共轭聚合物纳米纤维的图案 ,"<p>Organic materials have revolutionized optoelectronics by their processability, flexibility and low cost, with application to light-emitting devices for full-colour screens, solar cells and lasers. Some low-dimensional organic semiconductor structures exhibit properties resembling those of inorganics, such as polarized emission and enhanced electroluminescence. One-dimensional metallic, III&#8211;V and II&#8211;VI nanostructures have also been the subject of intense investigation as building blocks for nanoelectronics and photonics. Given that one-dimensional polymer nanostructures, such as polymer nanofibres, are compatible with sub-micrometre patterning capability and electromagnetic confinement within subwavelength volumes, they can offer the benefits of organic light sources to nanoscale optics. Here we report on the optical properties of fully conjugated, electrospun polymer nanofibres. We assess their waveguiding performance and emission tuneability in the whole visible range. We demonstrate the enhancement of the fibre forward emission through imprinting periodic nanostructures using room-temperature nanoimprint lithography, and investigate the angular dispersion of differently polarized emitted light.</p>",<p>有机材料以其可加工性，灵活性和低成本而彻底改变了光电技术，并应用于全彩色屏幕，太阳能电池和激光器的发光器件。一些低维有机半导体结构表现出类似于无机物的特性，例如极化发射和增强的电致发光。一维金属III＆＃8211; V和II＆＃8211; VI纳米结构作为纳米电子学和光子学的基础材料，也受到了广泛的研究。考虑到一维聚合物纳米结构（例如聚合物纳米纤维）与亚微米级的图案化能力和亚波长范围内的电磁限制兼容，它们可以为纳米级光学器件提供有机光源的优势。在这里，我们报告完全共轭的电纺聚合物纳米纤维的光学性能。我们评估了它们在整个可见光范围内的波导性能和发射可调谐性。通过使用室温纳米压印光刻技术，通过压印周期性纳米结构，证明了纤维正向发射的增强，并研究了不同偏振发射光的角色散。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.242,Coupling ion channels to receptors for biomolecule sensing,将离子通道与受体耦合以进行生物分子传感 ,"<p>Nanoscale electrical biosensors are promising tools for diagnostics and high-throughput screening systems. The electrical signal allows label-free assays with a high signal-to-noise ratio and fast real-time measurements. The challenge in developing such biosensors lies in functionally connecting a molecule detector to an electrical switch. Advances in this field have relied on synthetic ion-conducting pores and modified ion channels that are not yet suitable for biomolecule screening. Here we report the design and characterization of a novel bioelectric-sensing platform engineered by coupling an ion channel, which serves as the electrical probe, to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell. These ion-channel-coupled receptors may potentially detect a wide range of ligands recognized by natural or altered GPCRs, which are known to be major pharmaceutical targets. This could form a unique platform for label-free drug screening.</p>",<p>纳米级生物电传感器是用于诊断和高通量筛选系统的有前途的工具。电信号允许无标记的分析，具有高信噪比和快速的实时测量。开发这样的生物传感器的挑战在于将分子检测器功能性地连接到电开关。该领域的进展依赖于尚不适合生物分子筛选的合成离子传导孔和改良的离子通道。在这里，我们报告了一种新型生物电传感平台的设计和表征，该平台是通过将用作电探针的离子通道与G蛋白偶联受体（GPCR）结合而成的，GPCR是检测细胞外分子的一系列受体。这些离子通道偶联的受体可能潜在地检测被天然或改变的GPCR识别的各种配体，而这些已知是主要的药物靶标。这可以为无标签药物筛选提供一个独特的平台。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.211,Measurements of near-ultimate strength for multiwalled carbon nanotubes and irradiation-induced crosslinking improvements,测量多壁碳纳米管的近乎极限强度并改善辐照引起的交联 ,"<p>The excellent mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are being exploited in a growing number of applications from ballistic armour to nanoelectronics. However, measurements of these properties have not achieved the values predicted by theory due to a combination of artifacts introduced during sample preparation and inadequate measurements. Here we report multiwalled carbon nanotubes with a mean fracture strength &gt;100 GPa, which exceeds earlier observations by a factor of approximately three. These results are in excellent agreement with quantum-mechanical estimates for nanotubes containing only an occasional vacancy defect, and are &#8764;80% of the values expected for defect-free tubes. This performance is made possible by omitting chemical treatments from the sample preparation process, thus avoiding the formation of defects. High-resolution imaging was used to directly determine the number of fractured shells and the chirality of the outer shell. Electron irradiation at 200 keV for 10, 100 and 1,800 s led to improvements in the maximum sustainable loads by factors of 2.4, 7.9 and 11.6 compared with non-irradiated samples of similar diameter. This effect is attributed to crosslinking between the shells. Computer simulations also illustrate the effects of various irradiation-induced crosslinking defects on load sharing between the shells.</p>",<p>从弹道装甲到纳米电子学，碳纳米管的优异机械性能正被越来越多的应用所利用。但是，由于样品制备过程中引入的伪影和测量不足，这些特性的测量尚未达到理论预测的值。在这里，我们报道了平均断裂强度＞ 100GPa的多壁碳纳米管，其比先前的观察结果高约三倍。这些结果与仅包含偶有空位缺陷的纳米管的量子力学估计非常吻合，并且是无缺陷管预期值的80％。通过在样品制备过程中省略化学处理，可以实现这种性能，从而避免形成缺陷。高分辨率成像用于直接确定破裂的壳数和外壳的手性。与类似直径的未辐照样品相比，以200 keV的电子辐照10、100和1800 s可以使最大可持续负荷提高2.4、7.9和11.6倍。该作用归因于壳之间的交联。计算机仿真还说明了各种辐照引起的交联缺陷对壳之间载荷分配的影响。</ p>
