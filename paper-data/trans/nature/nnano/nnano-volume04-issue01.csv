10.1038/nnano.2008.378,Enzyme-assisted self-assembly under thermodynamic control,热力学控制下的酶辅助自组装 ,"<p>The production of functional molecular architectures through self-assembly is commonplace in biology, but despite advances, it is still a major challenge to achieve similar complexity in the laboratory. Self-assembled structures that are reproducible and virtually defect free are of interest for applications in three-dimensional cell culture, templating, biosensing and supramolecular electronics. Here, we report the use of reversible enzyme-catalysed reactions to drive self-assembly. In this approach, the self-assembly of aromatic short peptide derivatives provides a driving force that enables a protease enzyme to produce building blocks in a reversible and spatially confined manner. We demonstrate that this system combines three features: (i) self-correction&#8212;fully reversible self-assembly under thermodynamic control; (ii) component-selection&#8212;the ability to amplify the most stable molecular self-assembly structures in dynamic combinatorial libraries; and (iii) spatiotemporal confinement of nucleation and structure growth. Enzyme-assisted self-assembly therefore provides control in bottom-up fabrication of nanomaterials that could ultimately lead to functional nanostructures with enhanced complexities and fewer defects.</p>",<p>通过自组装产生功能性分子结构在生物学中很普遍，但是尽管取得了进步，但要在实验室中实现类似的复杂性仍然是一项重大挑战。具有可重现性且实际上无缺陷的自组装结构对于三维细胞培养，模板化，生物传感和超分子电子学中的应用很感兴趣。在这里，我们报告使用可逆酶催化反应来驱动自组装。在这种方法中，芳香族短肽衍生物的自组装提供了一种驱动力，该驱动力使蛋白酶能够以可逆和空间受限的方式产生结构单元。我们证明了该系统具有以下三个特征：（i）在热力学控制下的自校正和完全可逆的自组装； （ii）组件选择功能，能够在动态组合库中扩增最稳定的分子自组装结构； （iii）时空限制形核和结构生长。因此，酶辅助自组装为纳米材料的自下而上制造提供了控制，最终可能导致功能性纳米结构具有更高的复杂性和更少的缺陷。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.329,High-throughput solution processing of large-scale graphene,大规模石墨烯的高通量溶液处理 ,"<p>The electronic properties of graphene, such as high charge carrier concentrations and mobilities, make it a promising candidate for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. In particular, electrons and holes can undergo ballistic transport on the sub-micrometre scale in graphene and do not suffer from the scale limitations of current MOSFET technologies. However, it is still difficult to produce single-layer samples of graphene and bulk processing has not yet been achieved, despite strenuous efforts to develop a scalable production method. Here, we report a versatile solution-based process for the large-scale production of single-layer chemically converted graphene over the entire area of a silicon/SiO<sub>2</sub> wafer. By dispersing graphite oxide paper in pure hydrazine we were able to remove oxygen functionalities and restore the planar geometry of the single sheets. The chemically converted graphene sheets that were produced have the largest area reported to date (up to 20&#160;&#215;&#160;40&#160;&#181;m), making them far easier to process. Field-effect devices have been fabricated by conventional photolithography, displaying currents that are three orders of magnitude higher than previously reported for chemically produced graphene. The size of these sheets enables a wide range of characterization techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, to be performed on the same specimen.</p>",石墨烯的电子特性，例如高电荷载流子浓度和迁移率，使其成为下一代纳米电子器件的有希望的候选者。尤其是，电子和空穴可以在石墨烯中以亚微米级进行弹道传输，并且不会受到当前MOSFET技术的规模限制。但是，尽管为开发可扩展的生产方法付出了巨大的努力，但仍难以生产单层石墨烯样品，并且尚未实现批量加工。在这里，我们报告了一种基于解决方案的通用方法，可在硅/ SiO <sub> 2 </ sub>晶片的整个面积上大规模生产单层化学转化的石墨烯。通过将氧化石墨纸分散在纯肼中，我们能够去除氧官能团并恢复单张纸的平面几何形状。迄今为止，所生产的经过化学转化的石墨烯片材具有最大的面积报告（最大20微米）（最大20微米），使其易于加工。场效应器件已通过常规光刻技术制造，显示出的电流比先前报道的化学生产的石墨烯高三个数量级。这些薄片的尺寸使得可以在同一样品上进行多种表征技术，包括光学显微镜，扫描电子显微镜和原子力显微镜。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.365,Gram-scale production of graphene based on solvothermal synthesis and sonication,溶剂热合成和超声处理制革石墨烯 ,"<p>Carbon nanostructures have emerged as likely candidates for a wide range of applications, driving research into novel synthetic techniques to produce nanotubes, graphene and other carbon-based materials. Single sheets of pristine graphene have been isolated from bulk graphite in small amounts by micromechanical cleavage, and larger amounts of chemically modified graphene sheets have been produced by a number of approaches. Both of these techniques make use of highly oriented pyrolitic graphite as a starting material and involve labour-intensive preparations. Here, we report the direct chemical synthesis of carbon nanosheets in gram-scale quantities in a bottom-up approach based on the common laboratory reagents ethanol and sodium, which are reacted to give an intermediate solid that is then pyrolized, yielding a fused array of graphene sheets that are dispersed by mild sonication. The ability to produce bulk graphene samples from non-graphitic precursors with a scalable, low-cost approach should take us a step closer to real-world applications of graphene.</p>",碳纳米结构已经成为广泛应用的候选材料，推动了对生产纳米管，石墨烯和其他碳基材料的新型合成技术的研究。通过微机械裂解，已从块状石墨中少量分离出原始石墨烯单片，并已通过多种方法生产了大量化学改性的石墨烯片。这两种技术均使用高度取向的热解石墨作为起始原料，并涉及劳动密集型制备。在这里，我们报告了基于普通实验室试剂乙醇和钠的自底向上方法，以克为单位的克级数量的碳纳米片的直接化学合成，它们反应生成中间体固体，然后将其热解，得到通过轻度超声分散的石墨烯片。利用可扩展的低成本方法从非石墨前体生产大量石墨烯样品的能力应该使我们更接近石墨烯的实际应用。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.314,Power generation with laterally packaged piezoelectric fine wires,横向包装的压电细线发电 ,"<p>Converting mechanical energy into electricity could have applications in sensing, medical science, defence technology and personal electronics, and the ability of nanowires to &#8216;scavenge&#8217; energy from ambient and environmental sources could prove useful for powering nanodevices. Previously reported nanowire generators were based on vertically aligned piezoelectric nanowires that were attached to a substrate at one end and free to move at the other. However, there were problems with the output stability, mechanical robustness, lifetime and environmental adaptability of such devices. Here we report a flexible power generator that is based on cyclic stretching&#8211;releasing of a piezoelectric fine wire that is firmly attached to metal electrodes at both ends, is packaged on a flexible substrate, and does not involve sliding contacts. Repeatedly stretching and releasing a single wire with a strain of 0.05&#8211;0.1% creates an oscillating output voltage of up to &#8764;50 mV, and the energy conversion efficiency of the wire can be as high as 6.8%.</p>",<p>将机械能转化为电能可以在传感，医学，国防技术和个人电子产品中应用，并且可以使纳米线具有清除能力。来自周围和环境资源的能量可能被证明可为纳米设备供电。先前报道的纳米线发生器基于垂直对齐的压电纳米线，该压电纳米线的一端连接到基板，另一端自由移动。但是，这种设备的输出稳定性，机械强度，寿命和环境适应性存在问题。在这里，我们报告了一种柔性发电机，该柔性发电机是基于压电细线的周期性拉伸而松开的，该细线牢固地连接到两端的金属电极上，并包装在柔性基板上，并且不涉及滑动接触。重复拉伸和释放应变为0.05＆＃8211; 0.1％的单根导线会产生高达＆＃8764; 50 mV的振荡输出电压，并且导线的能量转换效率可以高达6.8％。 / p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.313,"Fast, sensitive and spectrally tuneable colloidal-quantum-dot photodetectors",快速，灵敏且可光谱调谐的胶体量子点光电探测器 ,"<p>Solution-processed semiconductors are compatible with a range of substrates, which enables their direct integration with organic circuits, microfluidics, optical circuitry and commercial microelectronics. Ultrasensitive photodetectors based on solution-process colloidal quantum dots operating in both the visible and infrared have been demonstrated, but these devices have poor response times (on the scale of seconds) to changes in illumination, and rapid-response devices based on a photodiode architecture suffer from low sensitivity. Here, we show that the temporal response of these devices is determined by two components&#8212;electron drift, which is a fast process, and electron diffusion, which is a slow process. By building devices that exclude the diffusion component, we are able to demonstrate a &gt;1,000-fold improvement in the sensitivity&#8211;bandwidth product of tuneable colloidal-quantum-dot photodiodes operating in the visible and infrared.</p>",<p>溶液处理的半导体与多种衬底兼容，从而使其能够与有机电路，微流体，光学电路和商业微电子直接集成。 已经证明了基于在可见光和红外光下均能工作的溶液处理胶体量子点的超灵敏光电探测器，但这些设备对照明变化的响应时间（以秒为单位）较差，而基于光电二极管架构的快速响应设备 灵敏度低。 在这里，我们表明这些设备的时间响应是由两个分量决定的：电子漂移是一个快速过程，而电子扩散是一个缓慢过程。 通过构建不包含扩散成分的设备，我们能够证明在可见光和红外光下工作的可调谐胶体量子点光电二极管的带宽乘积提高了1000倍以上。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.333,Optically monitoring the mechanical assembly of single molecules,光学监控单分子的机械组装 ,"<p>Bottom-up assembly at the level of individual molecules requires a combination of utmost spatial precision and efficient monitoring. We have previously shown how to &#8216;cut-and-paste&#8217; single molecules, and other groups have demonstrated that it is possible to beat the diffraction limit in optical microscopy. Here we show that a combination of single-molecule cut-and-paste surface assembly, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy can be used to deposit individual fluorophores in well-defined nanoscale patterns and also to monitor the process in real time with nanometre precision. Although the size of the pattern is well below the optical resolution of the microscope, the individual dyes are identified by localizing the centroids and detecting the photobleaching of the fluorophores. With this combination of methods, individual dyes or labelled biomolecules can be arranged at will for specific functions, such as coupled fluorophore systems or tailored enzyme cascades, and monitored with nanoscale precision.</p>",<p>从下至上组装单个分子需要结合最大的空间精度和有效的监控。前面我们已经展示了如何＆＃8216;剪切并粘贴＆＃8217;单分子和其他基团已经证明，有可能超过光学显微镜的衍射极限。在这里，我们证明了单分子切割和粘贴表面组装，全内反射荧光显微镜和原子力显微镜的结合可以用于以明确的纳米级图案沉积单个荧光团，并且可以实时监控过程。纳米精度。尽管图案的尺寸远低于显微镜的光学分辨率，但可以通过定位质心并检测荧光团的光漂白来识别单个染料。通过这种方法的组合，可以随意设置单个染料或标记的生物分子以实现特定功能，例如偶联的荧光团系统或定制的酶级联反应，并以纳米级精度进行监控。 
10.1038/nnano.2008.359,Controlled polytypic and twin-plane superlattices in iii–v nanowires,iii–v纳米线中的受控多型和双平面超晶格 ,"<p>Semiconductor nanowires show promise for use in nanoelectronics, fundamental electron transport studies, quantum optics and biological sensing. Such applications require a high degree of nanowire growth control, right down to the atomic level. However, many binary semiconductor nanowires exhibit a high density of randomly distributed twin defects and stacking faults, which results in an uncontrolled, or polytypic, crystal structure. Here, we demonstrate full control of the crystal structure of InAs nanowires by varying nanowire diameter and growth temperature. By selectively tuning the crystal structure, we fabricate highly reproducible polytypic and twin-plane superlattices within single nanowires. In addition to reducing defect densities, this level of control could lead to bandgap engineering and novel electronic behaviour.</p>",<p>半导体纳米线显示出有望用于纳米电子学，基础电子传输研究，量子光学和生物传感。 这样的应用需要高度的纳米线生长控制，直至原子级。 然而，许多二进制半导体纳米线表现出高密度的随机分布的孪晶缺陷和堆垛层错，这导致不受控制的或多型的晶体结构。 在这里，我们展示了通过改变纳米线直径和生长温度来完全控制InAs纳米线的晶体结构。 通过选择性地调节晶体结构，我们在单根纳米线内制造了高度可复制的多型和双平面超晶格。 除了降低缺陷密度之外，这种控制水平还可能导致带隙工程和新颖的电子行为。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.360,Tuning the optical and electronic properties of colloidal nanocrystals by lattice strain,通过晶格应变调整胶体纳米晶体的光学和电子性质 ,"<p>Strain can have a large influence on the properties of materials at the nanoscale. The effect of lattice strain on semiconductor devices has been widely studied, but its influence on colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals is still poorly understood. Here we show that the epitaxial deposition of a compressive shell (ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS or CdSe) onto a soft nanocrystalline core (CdTe) to form a lattice-mismatched quantum dot can dramatically change the conduction and valence band energies of both the core and the shell. In particular, standard type-I quantum-dot behaviour is replaced by type-II behaviour, which is characterized by spatial separation of electrons and holes, extended excited-state lifetimes and giant spectral shifts. Moreover, the strain induced by the lattice mismatch can be used to tune the light emission&#8212;which displays narrow linewidths and high quantum yields&#8212;across the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum (500&#8211;1,050&#160;nm). Lattice-mismatched core&#8211;shell quantum dots are expected to have applications in solar energy conversion, multicolour biomedical imaging and super-resolution optical microscopy.</p>","<p>应变可对纳米级材料的性能产生很大影响。晶格应变对半导体器件的影响已得到广泛研究，但对胶体半导体纳米晶体的影响仍知之甚少。在这里我们表明，将压缩壳（ZnS，ZnSe，ZnTe，CdS或CdSe）外延沉积到软纳米晶核（CdTe）上以形成晶格失配的量子点可以显着改变两者的导带和价带能核心和外壳。特别地，标准的I型量子点行为被II型行为所取代，II型行为的特征是电子和空穴的空间分离，激发态寿命的延长和巨大的光谱偏移。此外，由晶格失配引起的应变可用于调整在光谱的可见光和近红外部分显示的窄线宽和高量子产率的发光（500＆＃8211; 1,050＆＃ 160; nm）。晶格失配的核壳量子点有望在太阳能转换，多色生物医学成像和超分辨率光学显微镜中得到应用。</ p> "
10.1038/nnano.2008.364,Processing and properties of highly enriched double-wall carbon nanotubes,高浓缩双壁碳纳米管的制备及性能 ,"<p>Carbon nanotubes consist of one or more concentric graphene cylinders and are under investigation for a variety of applications that make use of their excellent thermal, mechanical, electronic and optical properties. Double-wall nanotubes are ideal systems for studying the interwall interactions influencing the properties of nanotubes with two or more walls. However, current techniques to synthesize double-wall nanotubes produce unwanted single- and multiwall nanotubes. Here, we show how density gradient ultracentrifugation can be used to separate double-wall nanotubes from mixtures of single- and multiwall nanotubes through differences in their buoyant density. This technique results in samples that are highly enriched in either single- or double-wall nanotubes of similar outer wall diameter, with the double-wall nanotubes being, on average, &#8764;44% longer than the single-wall nanotubes. The longer average length of the double-wall nanotubes provides distinct advantages when they are used in transparent conductors.</p>",碳纳米管由一个或多个同心的石墨烯圆柱体组成，目前正在研究利用其出色的热，机械，电子和光学特性的各种应用。双壁纳米管是研究影响两个或多个壁的纳米管性能的壁间相互作用的理想系统。但是，目前合成双壁纳米管的技术会产生不需要的单壁和多壁纳米管。在这里，我们展示了密度梯度超速离心如何通过浮力密度的差异将双壁纳米管从单壁和多壁纳米管的混合物中分离出来。该技术产生的样品高度富集于具有相似外壁直径的单壁或双壁纳米管中，而双壁纳米管平均比单壁纳米管长＃44％。当将双壁纳米管用于透明导体时，其平均长度较长，具有明显的优势。</ p>
