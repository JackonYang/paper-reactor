10.1038/nnano.2008.341,Cultural cognition of the risks and benefits of nanotechnology,对纳米技术风险和利益的文化认知 ,"<p>How is public opinion towards nanotechnology likely to evolve? The &#8216;familiarity hypothesis&#8217; holds that support for nanotechnology will likely grow as awareness of it expands. The basis of this conjecture is opinion polling, which finds that few members of the public claim to know much about nanotechnology, but that those who say they do are substantially more likely to believe its benefits outweigh its risks. Some researchers, however, have avoided endorsing the familiarity hypothesis, stressing that cognitive heuristics and biases could create anxiety as the public learns more about this novel science. We conducted an experimental study aimed at determining how members of the public would react to balanced information about nanotechnology risks and benefits. Finding no support for the familiarity hypothesis, the study instead yielded strong evidence that public attitudes are likely to be shaped by psychological dynamics associated with cultural cognition.</p>",<p>公众对纳米技术的看法可能如何演变？ 熟悉度假设＆＃8217; 认为随着人们对纳米技术的了解的扩大，对纳米技术的支持可能会增加。 这种推测的基础是民意调查，该调查发现很少有公众声称对纳米技术了解很多，但那些表示自己确实知道纳米技术的人更有可能认为纳米技术的好处大于风险。 但是，一些研究人员避免赞同这种熟悉的假设，强调随着公众对这种新颖科学的更多了解，认知启发法和偏见可能会引起焦虑。 我们进行了一项实验研究，旨在确定公众将如何对有关纳米技术风险和利益的平衡信息做出反应。 这项研究没有找到对熟悉性假设的支持，反而产生了强有力的证据，证明公众态度很可能由与文化认知相关的心理动力所塑造。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.361,Religious beliefs and public attitudes toward nanotechnology in Europe and the United States,欧美对纳米技术的宗教信仰和公众态度 ,"<p>How do citizens make sense of nanotechnology as more applications reach the market and the mainstream media start to debate the potential risks and benefits of technology? As with many other political and scientific issues, citizens rely on cognitive shortcuts or heuristics to make sense of issues for which they have low levels of knowledge. These heuristics can include predispositional factors, such as ideological beliefs or value systems, and also short-term frames of reference provided by the media or other sources of information. Recent research suggests that &#8216;religious filters&#8217; are an important heuristic for scientific issues in general, and nanotechnology in particular. A religious filter is more than a simple correlation between religiosity and attitudes toward science: it refers to a link between benefit perceptions and attitudes that varies depending on respondents' levels of religiosity. In surveys, seeing the benefits of nanotechnology is consistently linked to more positive attitudes about nanotechnology among less religious respondents, with this effect being significantly weaker for more religious respondents. For this study, we have combined public opinion surveys in the United States with Eurobarometer surveys about public attitudes toward nanotechnology in Europe to compare the influence of religious beliefs on attitudes towards nanotechnology in the United States and Europe. Our results show that respondents in the United States were significantly less likely to agree that nanotechnology is morally acceptable than respondents in many European countries. These moral views correlated directly with aggregate levels of religiosity in each country, even after controlling for national research productivity and measures of science performance for high-school students.</p>",<p>随着越来越多的应用进入市场，并且主流媒体开始辩论技术的潜在风险和利益，公民如何理解纳米技术？与许多其他政治和科学问题一样，公民依靠认知捷径或启发式方法来理解他们知识水平较低的问题。这些启发式方法可以包括易感性因素，例如意识形态信念或价值体系，以及媒体或其他信息来源提供的短期参考框架。最近的研究表明，＆＃8216;宗教过滤器＆＃8217;是对一般科学问题（尤其是纳米技术）的重要启发。宗教过滤器不只是宗教信仰与对科学的态度之间的简单关联：它是指利益观念与态度之间的联系，这种联系根据受访者的宗教信仰程度而变化。在调查中，看到纳米技术的好处始终与宗教较少的受访者对纳米技术的积极态度联系在一起，而对于宗教较多的受访者而言，这种影响明显减弱。在本研究中，我们将美国的公众意见调查与有关欧洲对纳米技术的公众态度的欧洲晴雨表调查相结合，以比较宗教信仰对美国和欧洲对纳米技术态度的影响。我们的结果表明，与许多欧洲国家的受访者相比，美国的受访者不太可能同意纳米技术在道德上是可以接受的。这些道德观点与每个国家的总体宗教信仰水平直接相关，甚至在控制了国家研究生产力和高中生科学表现的衡量指标之后。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.362,Deliberating the risks of nanotechnologies for energy and health applications in the United States and United Kingdom,在美国和英国审议用于能源和健康应用的纳米技术的风险 ,"<p>Emerging nanotechnologies pose a new set of challenges for researchers, governments, industries and citizen organizations that aim to develop effective modes of deliberation and risk communication early in the research and development process. These challenges derive from a number of issues including the wide range of materials and devices covered by the term &#8216;nanotechnology&#8217;, the many different industrial sectors involved, the fact that many areas of nanotechnology are still at a relatively early stage of development, and uncertainty about the environmental, health and safety impacts of nanomaterials. Public surveys have found that people in the United States and Europe currently view the benefits of nanotechnologies as outweighing their risks although, overall, knowledge about nanotechnology remains very low. However, surveys cannot easily uncover the ways that people will interpret and understand the complexities of nanotechnologies (or any other topic about which they know very little) when asked to deliberate about it in more depth, so new approaches to engaging the public are needed. Here, we report the results of the first comparative United States&#8211;United Kingdom public engagement experiment. Based upon four concurrent half-day workshops debating energy and health nanotechnologies we find commonalities that were unexpected given the different risk regulatory histories in the two countries. Participants focused on benefits rather than risks and, in general, had a high regard for science and technology. Application context was much more salient than nation as a source of difference, with energy applications viewed in a substantially more positive light than applications in health and human enhancement in both countries. More subtle differences were present in views about the equitable distribution of benefits, corporate and governmental trustworthiness, the risks to realizing benefits, and in consumerist attitudes.</p>",<p>新兴的纳米技术对研究人员，政府，行业和公民组织提出了一系列新挑战，这些挑战旨在在研发过程的早期就开发出有效的审议和风险沟通模式。这些挑战源于许多问题，其中包括“纳米技术”一词涵盖的材料和设备范围广泛，涉及的许多不同工业领域，纳米技术的许多领域仍处于相对较早的阶段这一事实。的发展，以及纳米材料对环境，健康和安全影响的不确定性。公开调查发现，尽管总体上讲，关于纳米技术的知识仍然很少，但美国和欧洲的人们目前认为纳米技术的好处远胜于风险。但是，当要求人们进行更深入的研究时，调查无法轻易揭示人们将如何解释和理解纳米技术的复杂性（或他们所知甚少的任何其他主题）的方式，因此需要一种新的方法来吸引公众。在这里，我们报告了美国第一个比较性的英国联合公众参与实验的结果。基于四个同时举行的为期半天的讨论能源和健康纳米技术的研讨会，我们发现鉴于两国不同的风险监管历史，这些共同点是出乎意料的。与会者关注的是收益而不是风险，并且总体上高度重视科学技术。与其他国家相比，应用环境比差异更为突出，能源应用远比两国在健康和人类健康方面的应用更为积极。在利益的公平分配，公司和政府的信誉，实现利益的风险以及消费者主义态度方面，存在着更为细微的差异。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.411,Current-driven atomic waterwheels,电流驱动的原子水车 ,"<p>A current induces forces on atoms inside the conductor that carries it. It is now possible to compute these forces from scratch, and to perform dynamical simulations of the atomic motion under current. One reason for this interest is that current can be a destructive force&#8212;it can cause atoms to migrate, resulting in damage and in the eventual failure of the conductor. But one can also ask, can current be made to do useful work on atoms? In particular, can an atomic-scale motor be driven by electrical current, as it can be by other mechanisms? For this to be possible, the current-induced forces on a suitable rotor must be non-conservative, so that net work can be done per revolution. Here we show that current-induced forces in atomic wires are not conservative and that they can be used, in principle, to drive an atomic-scale waterwheel.</p>",<p>电流在承载电流的导体内部的原子上感应力。 现在可以从头开始计算这些力，并对电流下的原子运动进行动态模拟。 引起这种兴趣的原因之一是电流可能是破坏力，它可能导致原子迁移，从而导致导体损坏并最终失效。 但是也有人会问，可以使电流在原子上做有用的工作吗？ 特别是，原子级电动机可以像其他机制一样由电流驱动吗？ 为了做到这一点，在适当的转子上的电流感应力必须是非保守的，以便每转可以完成净功。 在这里，我们证明了原子导线中的电流感应力并不保守，并且原则上可以将它们用于驱动原子级水车。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.400,Donor deactivation in silicon nanostructures,硅纳米结构中的施主失活 ,"<p>The operation of electronic devices relies on the density of free charge carriers available in the semiconductor; in most semiconductor devices this density is controlled by the addition of doping atoms. As dimensions are scaled down to achieve economic and performance benefits, the presence of interfaces and materials adjacent to the semiconductor will become more important and will eventually completely determine the electronic properties of the device. To sustain further improvements in performance, novel field-effect transistor architectures, such as FinFETs and nanowire field-effect transistors, have been proposed as replacements for the planar devices used today, and also for applications in biosensing and power generation. The successful operation of such devices will depend on our ability to precisely control the location and number of active impurity atoms in the host semiconductor during the fabrication process. Here, we demonstrate that the free carrier density in semiconductor nanowires is dependent on the size of the nanowires. By measuring the electrical conduction of doped silicon nanowires as a function of nanowire radius, temperature and dielectric surrounding, we show that the donor ionization energy increases with decreasing nanowire radius, and that it profoundly modifies the attainable free carrier density at values of the radius much larger than those at which quantum and dopant surface segregation effects set in. At a nanowire radius of 15&#160;nm the carrier density is already 50% lower than in bulk silicon due to the dielectric mismatch between the conducting channel and its surroundings.</p>",电子设备的操作取决于半导体中可用的自由电荷载流子的密度；在大多数半导体器件中，这种密度是通过添加掺杂原子来控制的。随着尺寸缩小以实现经济和性能优势，与半导体相邻的界面和材料的存在将变得更加重要，并最终将完全决定器件的电子性能。为了维持性能上的进一步改善，已经提出了新颖的场效应晶体管架构，例如FinFET和纳米线场效应晶体管，以替代当今使用的平面器件，并用于生物传感和发电领域。这种设备的成功运行将取决于我们在制造过程中精确控制主体半导体中活性杂质原子的位置和数量的能力。在这里，我们证明了半导体纳米线中的自由载流子密度取决于纳米线的大小。通过测量掺杂的硅纳米线的电导率随纳米线半径，温度和电介质周围环境的变化，我们发现施主电离能随着纳米线半径的减小而增加，并且在半径值大大改变了可达到的自由载流子密度大于发生量子和掺杂剂表面偏析的情况。由于导电沟道及其周围环境之间的介电失配，在15纳米纳米线处，载流子密度已经比体硅低50％。 / p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.363,Imaging the electrical conductance of individual carbon nanotubes with photothermal current microscopy,用光热电流显微镜成像单个碳纳米管的电导 ,"<p>The one-dimensional structure of carbon nanotubes leads to a variety of remarkable optical and electrical properties that could be used to develop novel devices. Recently, the electrical conductance of nanotubes has been shown to decrease under optically induced heating by an amount proportional to the temperature change. Here, we show that this decrease is also proportional to the initial nanotube conductance, and make use of this effect to develop a new electrical characterization tool for nanotubes. By scanning the focal spot of a laser across the surface of a device through which current is simultaneously measured, we can construct spatially resolved conductance images of both single and arrayed nanotube transistors. We can also directly image the gate control of these devices. Our results establish photothermal current microscopy as an important addition to the existing suite of characterization techniques for carbon nanotubes and other linear nanostructures.</p>",<p>碳纳米管的一维结构导致各种显着的光学和电学性质，可用于开发新型器件。 近来，已经显示出纳米管的电导率在光感应加热下降低了与温度变化成比例的量。 在这里，我们表明这种降低也与初始纳米管电导率成正比，并利用这种效应为纳米管开发了一种新的电表征工具。 通过在同时测量电流的设备表面上扫描激光的焦点，我们可以构建单个纳米管和阵列纳米管晶体管的空间分辨电导图像。 我们还可以直接对这些设备的门控制进行成像。 我们的结果建立了光热电流显微镜技术，作为对碳纳米管和其他线性纳米结构的现有表征技术套件的重要补充。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.369,Multimodal optical sensing and analyte specificity using single-walled carbon nanotubes,使用单壁碳纳米管的多峰光学传感和分析物特异性 ,"<p>Nanoscale sensing elements offer promise for single-molecule analyte detection in physically or biologically constrained environments. Single-walled carbon nanotubes have several advantages when used as optical sensors, such as photostable near-infrared emission for prolonged detection through biological media and single-molecule sensitivity. Molecular adsorption can be transduced into an optical signal by perturbing the electronic structure of the nanotubes. Here, we show that a pair of single-walled nanotubes provides at least four modes that can be modulated to uniquely fingerprint agents by the degree to which they alter either the emission band intensity or wavelength. We validate this identification method in vitro by demonstrating the detection of six genotoxic analytes, including chemotherapeutic drugs and reactive oxygen species, which are spectroscopically differentiated into four distinct classes, and also demonstrate single-molecule sensitivity in detecting hydrogen peroxide. Finally, we detect and identify these analytes in real time within live 3T3 cells, demonstrating multiplexed optical detection from a nanoscale biosensor and the first label-free tool to optically discriminate between genotoxins.</p>",<p>纳米级传感元件有望在物理或生物受限的环境中检测单分子分析物。单壁碳纳米管在用作光学传感器时具有多个优势，例如光稳定的近红外发射，可通过生物介质和单分子灵敏度进行长时间检测。通过干扰纳米管的电子结构，可以将分子吸附转换为光信号。在这里，我们显示了一对单壁纳米管提供了至少四个模式，通过改变发射带强度或波长的程度，可以将这些模式调制为唯一的指纹剂。我们通过演示检测六种遗传毒性分析物（包括化学疗法药物和活性氧物质）在体外验证了这种鉴定方法，这些物质在光谱学上分为四个不同的类别，并且还证明了在检测过氧化氢中的单分子敏感性。最后，我们在3T3活细胞中实时检测和鉴定这些分析物，证明了从纳米级生物传感器和第一个无需标记的工具对生物毒素进行光学区分的多重光学检测。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.373,One-step DNA-programmed growth of luminescent and biofunctionalized nanocrystals,DNA编程的发光和生物功能化纳米晶体的一步式生长 ,"<p>Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are widely used as lumiphores in biological imaging because their luminescence is both strong and stable, and because they can be biofunctionalized. During synthesis, nanocrystals are typically passivated with hydrophobic organic ligands, so it is then necessary either to replace these ligands or encapsulate the nanocrystals with hydrophilic moieties to make the lumiphores soluble in water. Finally, biological labels must be added to allow the detection of nucleic acids, proteins and specific cell types. This multistep process is time- and labour-intensive and thus out of reach of many researchers who want to use luminescent nanocrystals as customized lumiphores. Here, we show that a single designer ligand&#8212;a chimeric DNA molecule&#8212;can controllably program both the growth and the biofunctionalization of the nanocrystals. One part of the DNA sequence controls the nanocrystal passivation and serves as a ligand, while another part controls the biorecognition. The synthetic protocol reported here is straightforward and produces a homogeneous dispersion of nanocrystal lumiphores functionalized with a single biomolecular receptor. The nanocrystals exhibit strong optical emission in the visible region, minimal toxicity and have hydrodynamic diameters of &#8764;6 nm, which makes them suitable for bioimaging. We show that the nanocrystals can specifically bind DNA, proteins or cells that have unique surface recognition markers.</p>",胶体半导体纳米晶体被广泛用作生物成像中的发光体，因为它们的发光既牢固又稳定，并且可以被生物功能化。在合成期间，纳米晶体通常被疏水性有机配体钝化，因此有必要替换这些配体或用亲水性部分包裹纳米晶体以使荧光团溶于水。最后，必须添加生物标记，以检测核酸，蛋白质和特定细胞类型。这个多步骤的过程是费时费力的，因此对于许多想要使用发光纳米晶体作为定制发光体的研究人员来说是遥不可及的。在这里，我们显示了一个单一的设计配体/嵌合DNA分子可以可控地编程纳米晶体的生长和生物功能化。 DNA序列的一部分控制纳米晶体的钝化并用作配体，而另一部分控制生物识别。此处报道的合成方案简单明了，可产生由单个生物分子受体功能化的纳米晶体荧光团的均匀分散体。纳米晶体在可见光区域显示强光发射，毒性最小，并且流体动力学直径为≤6 nm，这使其适用于生物成像。我们证明纳米晶体可以特异性结合具有独特表面识别标记的DNA，蛋白质或细胞。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2008.374,Carbon nanotubes might improve neuronal performance by favouring electrical shortcuts,碳纳米管可能会通过支持电捷径来改善神经元的性能 ,"<p>Carbon nanotubes have been applied in several areas of nerve tissue engineering to probe and augment cell behaviour, to label and track subcellular components, and to study the growth and organization of neural networks. Recent reports show that nanotubes can sustain and promote neuronal electrical activity in networks of cultured cells, but the ways in which they affect cellular function are still poorly understood. Here, we show, using single-cell electrophysiology techniques, electron microscopy analysis and theoretical modelling, that nanotubes improve the responsiveness of neurons by forming tight contacts with the cell membranes that might favour electrical shortcuts between the proximal and distal compartments of the neuron. We propose the &#8216;electrotonic hypothesis&#8217; to explain the physical interactions between the cell and nanotube, and the mechanisms of how carbon nanotubes might affect the collective electrical activity of cultured neuronal networks. These considerations offer a perspective that would allow us to predict or engineer interactions between neurons and carbon nanotubes.</p>",碳纳米管已应用于神经组织工程的多个领域，以探测和增强细胞行为，标记和跟踪亚细胞成分，并研究神经网络的生长和组织。最近的报道表明，纳米管可以维持和促进培养细胞网络中神经元的电活动，但是影响细胞功能的方式仍然知之甚少。在这里，我们显示出，使用单细胞电生理技术，电子显微镜分析和理论建模，纳米管通过与细胞膜形成紧密接触而改善了神经元的反应能力，这可能有利于神经元近端和远端隔室之间的电捷径。我们提出了“电子假设”。解释细胞与纳米管之间的物理相互作用，以及碳纳米管如何影响培养的神经元网络的集体电活动的机制。这些考虑提供了一个视角，使我们可以预测或设计神经元和碳纳米管之间的相互作用。</ p>
