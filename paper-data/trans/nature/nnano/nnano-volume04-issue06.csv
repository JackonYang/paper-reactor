10.1038/nnano.2009.72,Modular construction of DNA nanotubes of tunable geometry and single- or double-stranded character,具有可变几何形状和单链或双链特征的DNA纳米管的模块化构造 ,"<p>DNA nanotubes can template the growth of nanowires, orient transmembrane proteins for nuclear magnetic resonance determination, and can potentially act as stiff interconnects, tracks for molecular motors and nanoscale drug carriers. Current methods for the construction of DNA nanotubes result in symmetrical and cylindrical assemblies that are entirely double-stranded. Here, we report a modular approach to DNA nanotube synthesis that provides access to geometrically well-defined triangular and square-shaped DNA nanotubes. We also construct the first nanotube assemblies that can exist in double- and single-stranded forms with significantly different stiffness. This approach allows for parameters such as geometry, stiffness, and single- or double-stranded character to be fine-tuned, and could enable the creation of designer nanotubes for a range of applications, including the growth of nanowires of controlled shape, the loading and release of cargo, and the real-time modulation of stiffness and persistence length within DNA interconnects.</p>",DNA纳米管可以模板化纳米线的生长，定向跨膜蛋白以进行核磁共振测定，并且可以潜在地充当刚性的互连体，分子马达和纳米级药物载体的轨道。用于构建DNA纳米管的当前方法导致对称和圆柱形的组件完全是双链的。在这里，我们报告了一种用于DNA纳米管合成的模块化方法，该方法可以访问几何形状明确的三角形和正方形DNA纳米管。我们还构建了可以以双链和单链形式存在且刚度明显不同的第一个纳米管组件。这种方法允许对诸如几何形状，刚度以及单链或双链特征之类的参数进行微调，并可以创建用于各种应用的设计纳米管，包括可控制形状的纳米线的生长，负载货物的释放和释放，以及DNA互连中的刚度和持久长度的实时调节。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2009.90,Ultrafast permeation of water through protein-based membranes,水通过蛋白质膜超快渗透 ,"<p>Pressure-driven filtration by porous membranes is widely used in the production of drinking water from ground and surface water. Permeation theory predicts that filtration rate is proportional to the pressure difference across the filtration membrane and inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane. However, these membranes need to be able to withstand high water fluxes and pressures, which means that the active separation layers in commercial filtration systems typically have a thickness of a few tens to several hundreds of nanometres. Filtration performance might be improved by the use of ultrathin porous silicon membranes or carbon nanotubes immobilized in silicon nitride or polymer films, but these structures are difficult to fabricate. Here, we report a new type of filtration membrane made of crosslinked proteins that are mechanically robust and contain channels with diameters of less than 2.2&#160;nm. We find that a 60-nm-thick membrane can concentrate aqueous dyes from fluxes up to 9,000&#160;l&#160;h<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>&#160;bar<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is &#8764;1,000 times higher than the fluxes that can be withstood by commercial filtration membranes with similar rejection properties. Based on these results and molecular dynamics simulations, we propose that protein-surrounded channels with effective lengths of less than 5.8&#160;nm can separate dye molecules while allowing the ultrafast permeation of water at applied pressures of less than 1&#160;bar.</p>","<p>多孔膜的压力驱动过滤广泛用于由地下水和地表水生产饮用水。渗透理论预测，过滤速率与整个过滤膜的压力差成正比，与膜的厚度成反比。然而，这些膜需要能够承受高的水通量和压力，这意味着商业过滤系统中的活性分离层通常具有几十至几百纳米的厚度。通过使用固定在氮化硅或聚合物膜中的超薄多孔硅膜或碳纳米管，可以提高过滤性能，但是这些结构很难制造。在这里，我们报告了一种新型的由交联蛋白制成的滤膜，该滤膜机械坚固，包含直径小于2.2纳米的通道。我们发现，厚度为60 nm的膜可以从高达9,000＆＃160; l＆＃160; h <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>＆＃160; m <sup>＆＃ 8722; 2 </ sup>＆＃160; bar <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>，它是具有类似排阻特性的商业滤膜所能承受的通量的1,000倍。根据这些结果和分子动力学模拟，我们建议有效长度小于5.8nm的蛋白质环绕通道可以分离染料分子，同时允许在小于1bar的施加压力下水超快渗透。 </ p> "
10.1038/nnano.2009.91,Alternating patterns on single-walled carbon nanotubes,单壁碳纳米管上的交替图案 ,"<p>Scientific and technological interest in one-dimensional nanomaterials, in particular carbon nanotubes, is a result of their fascinating properties and their ability to serve as templates for directed assembly. For applications in nanoelectronics it is necessary to create ordered arrays of nanotubes for large-scale integrated circuits, an area in which there has been significant progress, and to produce controllable patterns on individual nanotubes so that multiple transistors can be fabricated on them, an area where progress has been slower. Here, we show that judiciously selected crystalline block copolymers can be periodically decorated along carbon nanotubes, leading to amphiphilic, alternating patterns with a period of &#8764;12 nm. In addition, end-functionalization of the block copolymers allowed gold nanoparticles to be periodically attached to the nanotubes. This approach provides a facile technique for the periodic patterning of one-dimensional nanomaterials.</p>",一维纳米材料，特别是碳纳米管的科学和技术兴趣是其引人入胜的性能以及其用作定向组装模板的能力的结果。 对于纳米电子中的应用，有必要创建用于大规模集成电路的有序纳米管阵列，这是一个取得重大进展的领域，并在单个纳米管上产生可控制的图案，以便可以在其上制造多个晶体管。 进展缓慢的地方。 在这里，我们表明，明智地选择的晶体嵌段共聚物可以沿着碳纳米管周期性地装饰，从而导致两亲交替的图案，周期为＆＃8764; 12 nm。 另外，嵌段共聚物的末端官能化使得金纳米颗粒周期性地附着于纳米管。 这种方法为一维纳米材料的周期性构图提供了一种简便的技术。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2009.71,Tunable few-electron double quantum dots and Klein tunnelling in ultraclean carbon nanotubes,超净碳纳米管中可调谐的少数电子双量子点和克莱因隧穿 ,"<p>Quantum dots defined in carbon nanotubes are a platform for both basic scientific studies and research into new device applications. In particular, they have unique properties that make them attractive for studying the coherent properties of single-electron spins. To perform such experiments it is necessary to confine a single electron in a quantum dot with highly tunable barriers, but disorder has prevented tunable nanotube-based quantum-dot devices from reaching the single-electron regime. Here, we use local gate voltages applied to an ultraclean suspended nanotube to confine a single electron in both a single quantum dot and, for the first time, in a tunable double quantum dot. This tunability is limited by a novel type of tunnelling that is analogous to the tunnelling in the Klein paradox of relativistic quantum mechanics.</p>",碳纳米管中定义的量子点是基础科学研究和新设备应用研究的平台。 特别是，它们具有独特的性质，使其对研究单电子自旋的相干性质具有吸引力。 为了进行这样的实验，有必要将单个电子限制在具有高度可调的势垒的量子点中，但是无序阻止了基于可调纳米管的量子点器件达到单电子状态。 在这里，我们使用施加到超净悬浮纳米管的局部栅极电压，将单个电子限制在单个量子点中，并且首次将其限制在可调双量子点中。 这种可调谐性受到一种新型的隧道效应的限制，该隧道效应类似于相对论量子力学的克莱因悖论中的隧道效应。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2009.81,The crossover from two dimensions to one dimension in granular electronic materials,粒状电子材料从二维到一维的交叉 ,"<p>Granular conductors are solids comprising densely packed nanoparticles, and have electrical properties that are determined by the size, composition and packing of the composite nanoparticles. The ability to control these properties in two- and three-dimensional granular conductors has made such systems appropriate for use as prototypes for investigating new physics. However, the fabrication of strictly one-dimensional granular conductors remains challenging. Here, we describe a method for the assembly of nanoparticles into granular solids that can be tuned continuously from two to one dimension, and establish how electron transport evolves between these limits. We find that the energy barriers to transport increase in the one-dimensional limit, in both the variable-range-hopping (low-voltage) and sequential-tunnelling (high-voltage) regimes. Furthermore, in the sequential-tunnelling regime we find an unexpected relationship between the temperature and the voltage at which the conductance becomes appreciable &#8212; a relationship that appears peculiar to one-dimensional systems. These results are explained by extrapolating existing granular conductor theories to one dimension.</p>",颗粒导体是包含紧密堆积的纳米颗粒的固体，并且具有由复合纳米颗粒的尺寸，组成和堆积决定的电性能。在二维和三维颗粒导体中控制这些特性的能力使这种系统适合用作研究新物理的原型。然而，严格地一维粒状导体的制造仍然具有挑战性。在这里，我们描述了一种将纳米颗粒组装成颗粒状固体的方法，该方法可以从二维连续地调整到一维，并确定电子在这些极限之间如何演化。我们发现，在变程跳跃（低压）和顺序隧道（高压）状态下，运输的能量壁垒都在一维极限内增加。此外，在顺序调节模式下，我们发现温度和电导变得可观的电压之间存在意想不到的关系。一维系统特有的关系。通过将现有的粒状导体理论外推到一维来解释这些结果。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2009.82,Direct measurement of electrical conductance through a self-assembled molecular layer,通过自组装分子层直接测量电导 ,"<p>The self-assembly of organic molecules on surfaces is a promising approach for the development of nanoelectronic devices. Although a variety of strategies have been used to establish stable links between molecules, little is known about the electrical conductance of these links. Extended electronic states, a prerequisite for good conductance, have been observed for molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces. However, direct conductance measurements through a single layer of molecules are only possible if the molecules are adsorbed on a poorly conducting substrate. Here we use a nanoscale four-point probe to measure the conductivity of a self-assembled layer of cobalt phthalocyanine on a silver-terminated silicon surface as a function of thickness. For low thicknesses, the cobalt phthalocyanine molecules lie flat on the substrate, and their main effect is to reduce the conductivity of the substrate. At higher thicknesses, the cobalt phthalocyanine molecules stand up to form stacks and begin to conduct. These results connect the electronic structure and orientation of molecular monolayer and few-layer systems to their transport properties, and should aid in the rational design of future devices.</p>",<p>表面上有机分子的自组装是开发纳米电子器件的有前途的方法。尽管已使用多种策略在分子之间建立稳定的连接，但对这些连接的电导知之甚少。对于吸附在金属表面的分子，已经观察到扩展的电子状态，这是良好电导的前提。但是，仅当分子吸附在导电性较差的基材上时，才可以通过单个分子层进行直接电导测量。在这里，我们使用纳米级的四点探针来测量银端基硅表面上钴酞菁钴自组装层的电导率随厚度的变化。对于低厚度，钴酞菁分子平放在基材上，其主要作用是降低基材的电导率。在较高的厚度下，钴酞菁钴分子立起来形成堆叠并开始导电。这些结果将分子单层和多层系统的电子结构和取向与其传输性能联系起来，并应有助于未来器件的合理设计。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2009.92,Broadband all-photonic transduction of nanocantilevers,纳米悬臂的宽带全光子转导 ,"<p>Nanoelectromechanical systems based on cantilevers have consistently set records for sensitivity in measurements of displacement, force and mass over the past decade. Continued progress will require the integration of efficient transduction on a chip so that nanoelectromechanical systems may be operated at higher speeds and sensitivities. Conventional electrical schemes have limited bandwidth, and although optical methods are fast, they are subject to the diffraction limit. Here, we demonstrate the integration of nanocantilevers on a silicon photonic platform with a non-interferometric transduction scheme that avoids the diffraction limit by making use of near-field effects in optomechanical interactions. The use of a non-interferometric method means that a coherent light source is not required, making the monolithic integration of optomechanical systems with on-chip light sources feasible. We further demonstrate optomechanical multiplexing of an array of ten nanocantilevers with a displacement sensitivity of 40&#160;fm&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>.</p>",在过去的十年中，基于悬臂的纳米机电系统在位移，力和质量的测量中一直创下灵敏度记录。持续的进步将需要在芯片上集成有效的转导，以便可以以更高的速度和灵敏度来操作纳米机电系统。常规的电方案具有有限的带宽，并且尽管光学方法很快，但是它们受到衍射极限的限制。在这里，我们展示了纳米悬臂在硅光子平台上的集成，采用非干涉式传导方案，该方案通过在光机相互作用中利用近场效应来避免衍射极限。使用非干涉测量方法意味着不需要相干光源，从而使光机械系统与片上光源的单片集成成为可能。我们进一步展示了位移敏感度为40＆＃160; fm＆＃160; Hz <sup>＆＃8722; 1/2 </ sup>的十个纳米悬臂梁阵列的光机械多路复用。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2009.89,Trilayer graphene is a semimetal with a gate-tunable band overlap,三层石墨烯是一种具有门可调带重叠的半金属 ,"<p>Graphene-based materials are promising candidates for nanoelectronic devices because very high carrier mobilities can be achieved without the use of sophisticated material preparation techniques. However, the carrier mobilities reported for single-layer and bilayer graphene are still less than those reported for graphite crystals at low temperatures, and the optimum number of graphene layers for any given application is currently unclear, because the charge transport properties of samples containing three or more graphene layers have not yet been investigated systematically. Here, we study charge transport through trilayer graphene as a function of carrier density, temperature, and perpendicular electric field. We find that trilayer graphene is a semimetal with a resistivity that decreases with increasing electric field, a behaviour that is markedly different from that of single-layer and bilayer graphene. We show that the phenomenon originates from an overlap between the conduction and valence bands that can be controlled by an electric field, a property that had never previously been observed in any other semimetal. We also determine the effective mass of the charge carriers, and show that it accounts for a large part of the variation in the carrier mobility as the number of layers in the sample is varied.</p>",基于石墨烯的材料是纳米电子器件的有希望的候选者，因为无需使用复杂的材料制备技术就可以实现很高的载流子迁移率。然而，在低温下，单层和双层石墨烯的载流子迁移率仍小于石墨晶体的载流子迁移率，对于任何给定应用，石墨烯层的最佳层数目前尚不清楚，因为含三个样品的电荷迁移特性或更多的石墨烯层尚未得到系统的研究。在这里，我们研究通过三层石墨烯的电荷传输与载流子密度，温度和垂直电场的关系。我们发现三层石墨烯是电阻率随电场增加而降低的半金属，其行为与单层和双层石墨烯明显不同。我们表明，这种现象起源于可以通过电场控制的导带和价带之间的重叠，这种性质以前从未在任何其他半金属中观察到。我们还确定了载流子的有效质量，并表明随着样品中层数的变化，它占了载流子迁移率变化的很大一部分。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2009.77,Atomic force microscopy detects differences in the surface brush of normal and cancerous cells,原子力显微镜检测正常细胞和癌细胞表面刷子的差异 ,"<p>The atomic force microscope is broadly used to study the morphology of cells, but it can also probe the mechanics of cells. It is now known that cancerous cells may have different mechanical properties to those of normal cells, but the reasons for these differences are poorly understood. Here, we report quantitatively the differences between normal and cancerous human cervical epithelial cells by considering the brush layer on the cell surface. These brush layers, which consist mainly of microvilli, microridges and cilia, are important for interactions with the environment. Deformation force curves obtained from cells in vitro were processed according to the &#8216;brush on soft cell model&#8217;. We found that normal cells have brushes of one length, whereas cancerous cells have mostly two brush lengths of significantly different densities. The observed differences suggest that brush layers should be taken into account when characterizing the cell surface by mechanical means.</p>",<p>原子力显微镜被广泛用于研究细胞的形态，但它也可以探测细胞的力学。 现在已知癌细胞可能具有与正常细胞不同的机械性质，但是对这些差异的原因了解甚少。 在这里，我们通过考虑细胞表面的刷层来定量报告正常和癌性人宫颈上皮细胞之间的差异。 这些刷层主要由微绒毛，微脊和纤毛组成，对于与环境的相互作用很重要。 根据“软细胞模型上的刷子”处理从体外细胞获得的变形力曲线。 我们发现正常细胞的刷长只有一种，而癌细胞则多数是两种刷长，密度各不相同。 观察到的差异表明，在通过机械手段表征细胞表面时应考虑刷层。</ p>
