10.1038/nnano.2010.161,Beam pen lithography,束笔光刻 ,"<p>Lithography techniques are currently being developed to fabricate nanoscale components for integrated circuits, medical diagnostics and optoelectronics. In conventional far-field optical lithography, lateral feature resolution is diffraction-limited. Approaches that overcome the diffraction limit have been developed, but these are difficult to implement or they preclude arbitrary pattern formation. Techniques based on near-field scanning optical microscopy can overcome the diffraction limit, but they suffer from inherently low throughput and restricted scan areas. Highly parallel two-dimensional, silicon-based, near-field scanning optical microscopy aperture arrays have been fabricated, but aligning a non-deformable aperture array to a large-area substrate with near-field proximity remains challenging. However, recent advances in lithographies based on scanning probe microscopy have made use of transparent two-dimensional arrays of pyramid-shaped elastomeric tips (or &#8216;pens&#8217;) for large-area, high-throughput patterning of ink molecules. Here, we report a massively parallel scanning probe microscopy-based approach that can generate arbitrary patterns by passing 400-nm light through nanoscopic apertures at each tip in the array. The technique, termed beam pen lithography, can toggle between near- and far-field distances, allowing both sub-diffraction limit (100&#160;nm) and larger features to be generated.</p>",<p>光刻技术目前正在开发中，以制造用于集成电路，医学诊断和光电子学的纳米级组件。在常规的远场光学光刻中，横向特征分辨率受到衍射限制。已经开发出克服衍射极限的方法，但是这些方法难以实施，或者它们阻止了任意图案的形成。基于近场扫描光学显微镜的技术可以克服衍射极限，但是它们固有地吞吐量低且扫描区域受限。已经制造了高度平行的基于硅的二维近场扫描光学显微镜孔径阵列，但是将不可变形的孔径阵列对准具有近场接近性的大面积基板仍然具有挑战性。但是，基于扫描探针显微镜的光刻技术的最新进展已经利用金字塔形弹性体尖端（或“笔”）的透明二维阵列对墨水分子进行大面积，高通量的构图。在这里，我们报告了一种基于大规模并行扫描探针显微镜的方法，该方法可以通过使400 nm光穿过阵列中每个尖端的纳米孔径来生成任意图案。该技术被称为束笔光刻技术，可以在近场距离和远场距离之间切换，从而既可以产生亚衍射极限（100纳米），又可以产生更大的特征。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2010.151,Nanomechanical mass sensing and stiffness spectrometry based on two-dimensional vibrations of resonant nanowires,基于共振纳米线二维振动的纳米机械质量感测和刚度光谱 ,"<p>One-dimensional nanomechanical resonators based on nanowires and nanotubes have emerged as promising candidates for mass sensors. When the resonator is clamped at one end and the atoms or molecules being measured land on the other end (which is free to vibrate), the resonance frequency of the device decreases by an amount that is proportional to the mass of the atoms or molecules. However, atoms and molecules can land at any position along the resonator, and many biomolecules have sizes that are comparable to the size of the resonator, so the relationship between the added mass and the frequency shift breaks down. Moreover, whereas resonators fabricated by top-down methods tend to vibrate in just one dimension because they are usually shaped like diving boards, perfectly axisymmetric one-dimensional nanoresonators can support flexural vibrations with the same amplitude and frequency in two dimensions. Here, we propose a new approach to mass sensing and stiffness spectroscopy based on the fact that the nanoresonator will enter a superposition state of two orthogonal vibrations with different frequencies when this symmetry is broken. Measuring these frequencies allows the mass, stiffness and azimuthal arrival direction of the adsorbate to be determined.</p>",<p>基于纳米线和纳米管的一维纳米机械谐振器已经成为质量传感器的有希望的候选者。当谐振器的一端被夹住而被测原子或分子降落在另一端（自由振动）时，设备的谐振频率将降低与原子或分子质量成正比的量。但是，原子和分子可以在谐振器上的任意位置着陆，许多生物分子的大小与谐振器的大小相当，因此附加质量和频移之间的关系破裂。此外，虽然通过自顶向下方法制造的谐振器往往仅在一个维度上振动，因为它们通常形状像跳水板，而完全轴对称的一维纳米谐振器可以在两个维度上支持相同振幅和频率的弯曲振动。在此，我们提出了一种新的质量感测和刚度光谱方法，其基于以下事实：当这种对称性破坏时，纳米谐振器将进入具有不同频率的两个正交振动的叠加状态。测量这些频率可以确定被吸附物的质量，刚度和方位到达方向。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2010.165,Ultrasensitive detection of force and displacement using trapped ions,使用捕获离子超灵敏地检测力和位移 ,"<p>The ability to detect extremely small forces and nanoscale displacements is vital for disciplines such as precision spin-resonance imaging, microscopy, and tests of fundamental physical phenomena. Current force-detection sensitivity limits have surpassed 1&#160;aN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> (refs&#160;) through coupling of nanomechanical resonators to a variety of physical readout systems. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of trapped atomic ions behave as nanoscale mechanical oscillators and may form the core of exquisitely sensitive force and displacement detectors. We report the detection of forces with a sensitivity of 390&#160;&#177;&#160;150&#160;yN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>, which is more than three orders of magnitude better than existing reports using nanofabricated devices<sup>7</sup>, and discriminate ion displacements of &#8764;18 nm. Our technique is based on the excitation of tunable normal motional modes in an ion trap and detection through phase-coherent Doppler velocimetry, and should ultimately allow force detection with a sensitivity better than 1&#160;yN&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup> (ref.&#160;). Trapped-ion-based sensors could enable scientists to explore new regimes in materials science where augmented force, field and displacement sensitivity may be traded against reduced spatial resolution.</p>",<p>检测极小的力和纳米级位移的能力对于诸如精密自旋共振成像，显微镜和基本物理现象测试等学科至关重要。通过将纳米机械谐振器耦合到各种物理读出系统，当前的力检测灵敏度极限已超过1aN＆＃160; Hz <sup>＆＃8722; 1/2 </ sup>（refs＆＃160;）。在这里，我们证明了被捕获的原子离子的晶体表现为纳米级机械振荡器，并可能构成灵敏的力和位移检测器的核心。我们报告检测到的力的敏感度为390＆＃160;＆＃177;＆＃160; 150＆＃160; yN＆＃160; Hz <sup>＆＃8722; 1/2 </ sup>比使用纳米制造设备<sup> 7 </ sup>的现有报告要好三个数量级，并且可以分辨出18nm的离子位移。我们的技术基于离子阱中可调谐的正常运动模式的激发并通过相干多普勒测速仪进行检测，最终应能够以高于1＆＃160; yN＆＃160; Hz <sup>＆＃ 8722; 1/2 </ sup>（ref。＆＃160;）。基于俘获离子的传感器可以使科学家们探索材料科学的新领域，在新领域中，可以用增强的力，场和位移敏感性来交换降低的空间分辨率。 
10.1038/nnano.2010.162,Ultrahigh-power micrometre-sized supercapacitors based on onion-like carbon,基于洋葱状碳的超高功率微米级超级电容器 ,"<p>Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors, store energy in two closely spaced layers with opposing charges, and are used to power hybrid electric vehicles, portable electronic equipment and other devices. By offering fast charging and discharging rates, and the ability to sustain millions of cycles, electrochemical capacitors bridge the gap between batteries, which offer high energy densities but are slow, and conventional electrolytic capacitors, which are fast but have low energy densities. Here, we demonstrate microsupercapacitors with powers per volume that are comparable to electrolytic capacitors, capacitances that are four orders of magnitude higher, and energies per volume that are an order of magnitude higher. We also measured discharge rates of up to 200&#160;V&#160;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is three orders of magnitude higher than conventional supercapacitors. The microsupercapacitors are produced by the electrophoretic deposition of a several-micrometre-thick layer of nanostructured carbon onions with diameters of 6&#8211;7&#160;nm. Integration of these nanoparticles in a microdevice with a high surface-to-volume ratio, without the use of organic binders and polymer separators, improves performance because of the ease with which ions can access the active material. Increasing the energy density and discharge rates of supercapacitors will enable them to compete with batteries and conventional electrolytic capacitors in a number of applications.</p>",<p>电化学电容器，也称为超级电容器，以相反的电荷将能量存储在两个紧密间隔的层中，并用于为混合动力电动汽车，便携式电子设备和其他设备供电。通过提供快速的充电和放电速率，以及能够维持数百万次循环的能力，电化学电容器弥合了电池之间的间隙，而电池之间的间隙提供了高能量密度，但速度较慢；而常规电解电容器则具有快速但能量密度低的特点。在这里，我们演示了微型超级电容器，其单位体积的功率可与电解电容器相比，电容要高四个数量级，单位体积的能量要高出一个数量级。我们还测量了高达200V / s <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>的放电速率，这比传统的超级电容器高出三个数量级。微型超级电容器是通过电泳沉积几微米厚的直径为6＆＃8211; 7＆＃160nm的纳米结构碳洋葱层而制成的。在不使用有机粘合剂和聚合物隔板的情况下，将这些纳米颗粒集成在具有高表面积/体积比的微型设备中，由于离子可轻松进入活性材料，因此可提高性能。超级电容器的能量密度和放电率的提高将使其能够在许多应用中与电池和常规电解电容器竞争。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2010.154,Very large magnetoresistance in graphene nanoribbons,石墨烯纳米带中非常大的磁阻 ,"<p>Graphene has unique electronic properties, and graphene nanoribbons are of particular interest because they exhibit a conduction bandgap that arises due to size confinement and edge effects. Theoretical studies have suggested that graphene nanoribbons could have interesting magneto-electronic properties, with a very large predicted magnetoresistance. Here, we report the experimental observation of a significant enhancement in the conductance of a graphene nanoribbon field-effect transistor by a perpendicular magnetic field. A negative magnetoresistance of nearly 100% was observed at low temperatures, with over 50% magnetoresistance remaining at room temperature. This magnetoresistance can be tuned by varying the gate or source&#8211;drain bias. We also find that the charge transport in the nanoribbons is not significantly modified by an in-plane magnetic field. The large observed values of magnetoresistance may be attributed to the reduction of quantum confinement through the formation of cyclotron orbits and the delocalization effect under the perpendicular magnetic field.</p>",石墨烯具有独特的电子性能，石墨烯纳米带特别受关注，因为它们显示出由于尺寸限制和边缘效应而产生的导带隙。理论研究表明，石墨烯纳米带可能具有有趣的磁电性质，并具有很大的预测磁阻。在这里，我们报告了通过垂直磁场显着增强石墨烯纳米带场效应晶体管电导的实验观察。在低温下观察到接近100％的负磁阻，而在室温下剩余超过50％的磁阻。可以通过改变栅极或源极的漏极偏置来调整此磁阻。我们还发现，纳米带中的电荷传输不会受到面内磁场的明显影响。磁阻的较大观测值可能归因于回旋加速器轨道的形成和垂直磁场下的离域效应，从而减少了量子约束。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2010.148,Bioorthogonal chemistry amplifies nanoparticle binding and enhances the sensitivity of cell detection,生物正交化学可放大纳米颗粒的结合并增强细胞检测的灵敏度 ,"<p>Nanoparticles have emerged as key materials for biomedical applications because of their unique and tunable physical properties, multivalent targeting capability, and high cargo capacity. Motivated by these properties and by current clinical needs, numerous diagnostic and therapeutic nanomaterials have recently emerged. Here we describe a novel nanoparticle targeting platform that uses a rapid, catalyst-free cycloaddition as the coupling mechanism. Antibodies against biomarkers of interest were modified with trans-cyclooctene and used as scaffolds to couple tetrazine-modified nanoparticles onto live cells. We show that the technique is fast, chemoselective, adaptable to metal nanomaterials, and scalable for biomedical use. This method also supports amplification of biomarker signals, making it superior to alternative targeting techniques including avidin/biotin.</p>",纳米颗粒由于其独特且可调节的物理性能，多价靶向能力和高载货量而成为生物医学应用的关键材料。 受这些特性和当前临床需求的激励，最近出现了许多诊断和治疗纳米材料。 在这里，我们描述了一种新型的纳米粒子靶向平台，该平台使用快速，无催化剂的环加成作为偶联机制。 用反式环辛烯修饰了针对目标生物标志物的抗体，并将其用作将四嗪修饰的纳米颗粒偶联到活细胞上的支架。 我们证明了该技术快速，化学选择性，适用于金属纳米材料，并且可扩展用于生物医学用途。 该方法还支持扩增生物标志物信号，使其优于包括抗生物素蛋白/生物素在内的其他靶向技术。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2010.135,Rationally designed logic integration of regulatory signals in mammalian cells,合理设计哺乳动物细胞中调节信号的逻辑整合 ,"<p>Molecular-level information processing is essential for &#8216;smart&#8217; in vivo nanosystems. Natural molecular computing, such as the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis by special proteins called transcription factors, has inspired engineered systems that can control the levels of mRNA with certain combinations of transcription factors. Here, we show an alternative approach to achieving general-purpose control of mRNA and protein levels by logic integration of transcription factor input signals in mammalian cells. The transcription factors regulate synthetic genes coding for small regulatory RNAs (called microRNAs), which, in turn, control the mRNA of interest (the output) via an RNA interference pathway. The simplicity of these modular interactions makes it possible, in theory, to implement any arbitrary logic relation between the transcription factors and the output. We construct, test and optimize increasingly complex circuits with up to three transcription factor inputs, establishing a platform for in vivo molecular computing.</p>",<p>分子级信息处理对于＆＃8216;智能＆＃8217;至关重要。体内纳米系统。天然分子计算，例如通过称为转录因子的特殊蛋白质对信使RNA（mRNA）合成的调控，启发了工程系统，该系统可以通过某些转录因子组合来控制mRNA的水平。在这里，我们展示了通过对哺乳动物细胞中转录因子输入信号进行逻辑整合来实现对mRNA和蛋白质水平的通用控制的另一种方法。转录因子调控合成的基因，这些基因编码小的调控RNA（称为microRNA），而后者又通过RNA干扰途径控制目标mRNA（输出）。从理论上讲，这些模块化交互的简单性使得在转录因子和输出之间实现任意逻辑关系成为可能。我们使用多达三个转录因子输入来构建，测试和优化日益复杂的电路，从而建立了用于体内分子计算的平台。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2010.164,An index for characterization of nanomaterials in biological systems,生物系统中纳米材料的表征指标 ,"<p>In a physiological environment, nanoparticles selectively absorb proteins to form &#8216;nanoparticle&#8211;protein coronas&#8217;, a process governed by molecular interactions between chemical groups on the nanoparticle surfaces and the amino-acid residues of the proteins. Here, we propose a biological surface adsorption index to characterize these interactions by quantifying the competitive adsorption of a set of small molecule probes onto the nanoparticles. The adsorption properties of nanomaterials are assumed to be governed by Coulomb forces, London dispersion, hydrogen-bond acidity and basicity, polarizability and lone-pair electrons. Adsorption coefficients of the probe compounds were measured and used to create a set of nanodescriptors representing the contributions and relative strengths of each molecular interaction. The method successfully predicted the adsorption of various small molecules onto carbon nanotubes, and the nanodescriptors were also measured for 12 other nanomaterials. The biological surface adsorption index nanodescriptors can be used to develop pharmacokinetic and safety assessment models for nanomaterials.</p>",<p>在生理环境中，纳米粒子选择性地吸收蛋白质以形成纳米粒子蛋白质电晕，该过程受纳米粒子表面上化学基团与蛋白质氨基酸残基之间的分子相互作用的控制。在这里，我们提出了一种生物表面吸附指数，通过量化一组小分子探针在纳米粒子上的竞争性吸附来表征这些相互作用。假定纳米材料的吸附性能受库仑力，伦敦分散，氢键酸度和碱度，极化率和孤对电子的控制。测量探针化合物的吸附系数，并将其用于创建一组纳米描述符，以表示每种分子相互作用的贡献和相对强度。该方法成功地预测了各种小分子在碳纳米管上的吸附，并且还测量了其他12种纳米材料的纳米描述符。生物表面吸附指数纳米描述子可用于建立纳米材料的药代动力学和安全性评估模型。</ p>

Here, we report a strategy to design three-dimensional nanoscale scaffolds that can be self-assembled from RNA with precise control over their shape, size and composition. These cubic nanoscaffolds are only &#8764;13 nm in diameter and are composed of short oligonucleotides, making them amenable to chemical synthesis, point modifications and further functionalization. Nanocube assembly is verified by gel assays, dynamic light scattering and cryogenic electron microscopy. Formation of functional RNA nanocubes is also demonstrated by incorporation of a light-up fluorescent RNA aptamer that is optimally active only upon full RNA assembly. Moreover, we show that the RNA nanoscaffolds can self-assemble in isothermal conditions (37 &#176;C) during in vitro transcription, which opens a route towards the construction of sensors, programmable packaging and cargo delivery systems for biomedical applications.</p>",<p>将生物材料组织成通用的三维组件可用于构建用于纳米医学的多功能治疗支架。在这里，我们报告了一种设计三维纳米支架的策略，该支架可以从RNA自组装，并对其形状，大小和组成进行精确控制。这些立方纳米支架的直径仅为13纳米，由短寡核苷酸组成，使其易于化学合成，修饰点和进一步功能化。纳米立方体的组装已通过凝胶分析，动态光散射和低温电子显微镜进行了验证。功能性RNA纳米立方体的形成还通过掺入仅在完整RNA组装后才具有最佳活性的亮起荧光的RNA适体来证明。此外，我们显示RNA纳米支架可以在体外转录过程中在恒温条件下（37°C）自组装，这为生物医学应用的传感器，可编程包装和货物运输系统的构建开辟了一条途径。 >

Several reports have described the in vivo toxicity of carbon nanotubes, but their effects on male reproduction have not been examined. Here, we show that repeated intravenous injections of water-soluble multiwalled carbon nanotubes into male mice can cause reversible testis damage without affecting fertility. Nanotubes accumulated in the testes, generated oxidative stress and decreased the thickness of the seminiferous epithelium in the testis at day 15, but the damage was repaired at 60 and 90 days. The quantity, quality and integrity of the sperm and the levels of three major sex hormones were not significantly affected throughout the 90-day period. The fertility of treated male mice was unaffected; the pregnancy rate and delivery success of female mice that mated with the treated male mice did not differ from those that mated with untreated male mice.</p>",<p>可溶性碳纳米管有望成为体内递送和成像应用的材料。 几篇报道描述了碳纳米管的体内毒性，但尚未研究其对雄性生殖的影响。 在这里，我们表明，反复向雄性小鼠中静脉注射水溶性多壁碳纳米管可导致可逆的睾丸损伤，而不会影响生育能力。 在第15天，纳米管聚集在睾丸中，产生氧化应激并减少睾丸中生精上皮的厚度，但在60天和90天时修复了损伤。 在整个90天内，精子的数量，质量和完整性以及三种主要性激素的水平均未受到明显影响。 处理过的雄性小鼠的生育力不受影响； 与处理过的雄性小鼠交配的雌性小鼠的妊娠率和分娩成功与未处理过的雄性小鼠交配的无异。</ p>
