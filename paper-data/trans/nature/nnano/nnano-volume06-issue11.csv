10.1038/nnano.2011.172,Ambipolar field effect in the ternary topological insulator (BixSb1–x)2Te3 by composition tuning,三元拓扑绝缘子（BixSb1-x）2Te3中的双极场效应，通过成分调整 ,"<p>Topological insulators exhibit a bulk energy gap and spin-polarized surface states that lead to unique electronic properties, with potential applications in spintronics and quantum information processing. However, transport measurements have typically been dominated by residual bulk charge carriers originating from crystal defects or environmental doping, and these mask the contribution of surface carriers to charge transport in these materials. Controlling bulk carriers in current topological insulator materials, such as the binary sesquichalcogenides Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>, has been explored extensively by means of material doping and electrical gating, but limited progress has been made to achieve nanostructures with low bulk conductivity for electronic device applications. Here we demonstrate that the ternary sesquichalcogenide (Bi<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>1&#8211;x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> is a tunable topological insulator system. By tuning the ratio of bismuth to antimony, we are able to reduce the bulk carrier density by over two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the topological insulator properties. As a result, we observe a clear ambipolar gating effect in (Bi<sub>x</sub>Sb<sub>1&#8211;x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> nanoplate field-effect transistor devices, similar to that observed in graphene field-effect transistor devices. The manipulation of carrier type and density in topological insulator nanostructures demonstrated here paves the way for the implementation of topological insulators in nanoelectronics and spintronics.</p>",<p>拓扑绝缘体表现出大的能隙和自旋极化的表面状态，从而导致独特的电子特性，在自旋电子学和量子信息处理中具有潜在的应用。但是，传输测量通常主要由源自晶体缺陷或环境掺杂的残余大容量电荷载流子控制，这些掩盖了表面载流子对这些材料中电荷传输的贡献。控制当前拓扑绝缘体材料中的散装载流子，例如二元倍半硫化物Bi <sub> 2 </ sub> Te <sub> 3 </ sub>，Sb <sub> 2 </ sub> Te <sub> 3 </ sub >和Bi <sub> 2 </ sub> Se <sub> 3 </ sub>已通过材料掺杂和电门控得到了广泛的研究，但是在实现电子器件低体积电导率的纳米结构方面进展有限。应用程序。在这里，我们证明三元倍半硫化物（Bi <sub> x </ sub> Sb <sub> 1＆＃8211; x </ sub>）<sub> 2 </ sub> Te <sub> 3 </ sub>可调拓扑绝缘子系统。通过调整铋与锑的比例，我们能够将载流子密度降低两个数量级以上，同时保持拓扑绝缘体的性能。结果，我们在（Bi <sub> x </ sub> Sb <sub> 1＆＃8211; x </ sub>）<sub> 2 </ sub> Te <sub> 3 <纳米板场效应晶体管器件，类似于在石墨烯场效应晶体管器件中观察到的。此处展示的对拓扑绝缘体纳米结构中载流子类型和密度的操纵为纳米电子学和自旋电子学中拓扑绝缘体的实现铺平了道路。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.167,Step-like enhancement of luminescence quantum yield of silicon nanocrystals,逐步提高硅纳米晶体的发光量子产率 ,"<p>Carrier multiplication by generation of two or more electron&#8211;hole pairs following the absorption of a single photon may lead to improved photovoltaic efficiencies and has been observed in nanocrystals made from a variety of semiconductors, including silicon. However, with few exceptions, these reports have been based on indirect ultrafast techniques. Here, we present evidence of carrier multiplication in closely spaced silicon nanocrystals contained in a silicon dioxide matrix by measuring enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield. As the photon energy increases, the quantum yield is expected to remain constant, or to decrease as a result of new trapping and recombination channels being activated. Instead, we observe a step-like increase in quantum yield for larger photon energies that is characteristic of carrier multiplication. Modelling suggests that carrier multiplication is occurring with high efficiency and close to the energy conservation limit.</p>",吸收单个光子后，通过产生两个或多个电子空穴对产生载流子增殖，可提高光伏效率，并且已在由多种半导体制成的纳米晶体（包括硅）中观察到。 但是，除少数例外，这些报告均基于间接超快速技术。 在这里，我们通过测量增强的光致发光量子产率，在二氧化硅基质中包含的紧密间隔的硅纳米晶体中提供了载流子增殖的证据。 随着光子能量的增加，预计量子产率将保持恒定，或由于激活了新的俘获和重组通道而降低。 相反，我们观察到较大光子能量的量子产率呈阶梯状增加，这是载流子倍增的特征。 建模表明，载流子的增殖效率很高，并且接近节能极限。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.151,Cell entry of one-dimensional nanomaterials occurs by tip recognition and rotation,一维纳米材料的细胞进入通过尖端识别和旋转发生 ,"<p>Materials with high aspect ratio, such as carbon nanotubes and asbestos fibres, have been shown to cause length-dependent toxicity in certain cells because these long materials prevent complete ingestion and this frustrates the cell. Biophysical models have been proposed to explain how spheres and elliptical nanostructures enter cells, but one-dimensional nanomaterials have not been examined. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that cylindrical one-dimensional nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes enter cells through the tip first. For nanotubes with end caps or carbon shells at their tips, uptake involves tip recognition through receptor binding, rotation that is driven by asymmetric elastic strain at the tube&#8211;bilayer interface, and near-vertical entry. The precise angle of entry is governed by the relative timescales for tube rotation and receptor diffusion. Nanotubes without caps or shells on their tips show a different mode of membrane interaction, posing an interesting question as to whether modifying the tips of tubes may help avoid frustrated uptake by cells.</p>",<p>高纵横比的材料，例如碳纳米管和石棉纤维，已被证明在某些细胞中会引起长度依赖性毒性，因为这些长物质阻止了完全摄入，从而使细胞受挫。已经提出了生物物理模型来解释球体和椭圆形纳米结构如何进入细胞，但是一维纳米材料尚未得到检验。在这里，我们从实验和理论上表明，圆柱形一维纳米材料（例如碳纳米管）首先通过尖端进入细胞。对于在末端带有端盖或碳壳的纳米管，吸收涉及通过受体结合，由在管双层界面处的不对称弹性应变驱动的旋转以及接近垂直进入的尖端识别。精确的入射角由试管旋转和受体扩散的相对时间尺度决定。尖端上没有盖子或壳的纳米管表现出不同的膜相互作用模式，这引起了一个有趣的问题，即修饰管的尖端是否可以帮助避免细胞摄取受阻。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.160,Nanowired three-dimensional cardiac patches,纳米线三维心脏贴片 ,"<p>Engineered cardiac patches for treating damaged heart tissues after a heart attack are normally produced by seeding heart cells within three-dimensional porous biomaterial scaffolds. These biomaterials, which are usually made of either biological polymers such as alginate or synthetic polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), help cells organize into functioning tissues, but poor conductivity of these materials limits the ability of the patch to contract strongly as a unit. Here, we show that incorporating gold nanowires within alginate scaffolds can bridge the electrically resistant pore walls of alginate and improve electrical communication between adjacent cardiac cells. Tissues grown on these composite matrices were thicker and better aligned than those grown on pristine alginate and when electrically stimulated, the cells in these tissues contracted synchronously. Furthermore, higher levels of the proteins involved in muscle contraction and electrical coupling are detected in the composite matrices. It is expected that the integration of conducting nanowires within three-dimensional scaffolds may improve the therapeutic value of current cardiac patches.</p>",通常，通过在3D多孔生物材料支架中植入心脏细胞来生产用于治疗心脏病发作后受损的心脏组织的工程化心脏贴片。这些生物材料通常由生物聚合物（例如藻酸盐）或合成聚合物（例如聚乳酸）（PLA）制成，可帮助细胞组织为功能正常的组织，但是这些材料的导电性差，会限制贴片强烈收缩的能力作为一个单元。在这里，我们表明将金纳米线纳入藻酸盐支架中可以桥接藻酸盐的电阻孔壁并改善相邻心脏细胞之间的电连通。在这些复合基质上生长的组织比在原始藻酸盐上生长的组织更厚且排列更好，并且在电刺激时，这些组织中的细胞同步收缩。此外，在复合基质中检测到较高水平的参与肌肉收缩和电耦合的蛋白质。有望将导电纳米线整合到三维支架中，可以提高当前心脏贴片的治疗价值。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.180,Dynamic manipulation of nanomechanical resonators in the high-amplitude regime and non-volatile mechanical memory operation,纳米机械谐振器在高振幅状态下的动态操纵和非易失性机械存储操作 ,"<p>The ability to control mechanical motion with optical forces has made it possible to cool mechanical resonators to their quantum ground states. The same techniques can also be used to amplify rather than reduce the mechanical motion of such systems. Here, we study nanomechanical resonators that are slightly buckled and therefore have two stable configurations, denoted &#8216;buckled up&#8217; and &#8216;buckled down&#8217;, when they are at rest. The motion of these resonators can be described by a double-well potential with a large central energy barrier between the two stable configurations. We demonstrate the high-amplitude operation of a buckled resonator coupled to an optical cavity by using a highly efficient process to generate enough phonons in the resonator to overcome the energy barrier in the double-well potential. This allows us to observe the first evidence for nanomechanical slow-down and a zero-frequency singularity predicted by theorists. We also demonstrate a non-volatile mechanical memory element in which bits are written and reset by using optomechanical backaction to direct the relaxation of a resonator in the high-amplitude regime to a specific stable configuration.</p>",<p>利用光学力控制机械运动的能力使得将机械谐振器冷却到其量子基态成为可能。相同的技术也可以用于放大而不是减小这种系统的机械运动。在这里，我们研究的是微弯曲的纳米机械谐振器，因此具有两个稳定的配置，表示为“扣紧”。和“休息时扣紧”。这些谐振器的运动可通过两个稳定配置之间具有较大中央能垒的双阱电势来描述。我们通过使用高效过程在谐振器中生成足够的声子来克服双阱势能中的能垒，证明了与光腔耦合的弯曲谐振器的高振幅操作。这使我们可以观察到纳米机械减速和理论家预测的零频率奇点的第一个证据。我们还演示了一种非易失性机械存储元件，其中通过使用光机械反向作用将位在高振幅范围内的谐振器的弛豫控制为特定的稳定配置，来写入和复位位。 
10.1038/nnano.2011.159,Unity quantum yield of photogenerated charges and band-like transport in quantum-dot solids,光生电荷的统一量子产率和量子点固体中的带状传输 ,"<p>Solid films of colloidal quantum dots show promise in the manufacture of photodetectors and solar cells. These devices require high yields of photogenerated charges and high carrier mobilities, which are difficult to achieve in quantum-dot films owing to a strong electron&#8211;hole interaction and quantum confinement. Here, we show that the quantum yield of photogenerated charges in strongly coupled PbSe quantum-dot films is unity over a large temperature range. At high photoexcitation density, a transition takes place from hopping between localized states to band-like transport. These strongly coupled quantum-dot films have electrical properties that approach those of crystalline bulk semiconductors, while retaining the size tunability and cheap processing properties of colloidal quantum dots.</p>",<p>胶体量子点的固态膜在光探测器和太阳能电池的制造中显示出希望。 这些器件需要高产率的光生电荷和高载流子迁移率，由于强的电子空穴相互作用和量子限制，在量子点膜中难以实现。 在这里，我们表明强耦合的PbSe量子点薄膜中光生电荷的量子产率在很大的温度范围内是一致的。 在高的光激发密度下，会发生从局部状态之间的跃迁到带状传输的过渡。 这些强耦合的量子点薄膜具有接近晶体体半导体的电学性能，同时保留了胶体量子点的尺寸可调性和廉价的加工性能。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.165,Dynamic internal gradients control and direct electric currents within nanostructured materials,动态内部梯度控制和纳米结构材料内的直流电 ,"<p>Switchable nanomaterials&#8212;materials that can change their properties and/or function in response to external stimuli&#8212;have potential applications in electronics, sensing and catalysis. Previous efforts to develop such materials have predominately used molecular switches that can modulate their properties by means of conformational changes. Here, we show that electrical conductance through films of gold nanoparticles coated with a monolayer of charged ligands can be controlled by dynamic, long-range gradients of both mobile counterions surrounding the nanoparticles and conduction electrons on the nanoparticle cores. The internal gradients and the electric fields they create are easily reconfigurable, and can be set up in such a way that electric currents through the nanoparticles can be modulated, blocked or even deflected so that they only pass through select regions of the material. The nanoion/counterion hybrids combine the properties of electronic conductors with those of ionic gels/polymers, are easy to process by solution-casting and, by controlling the internal gradients, can be reconfigured into different electronic elements (current rectifiers, switches and diodes).</p>",<p>可转换纳米材料和可响应外部刺激而改变其特性和/或功能的材料具有在电子，传感和催化方面的潜在应用。以前开发这种材料的努力主要是使用分子开关，该开关可以通过构象变化来调节其性质。在这里，我们表明，通过包覆有单层带电配体的金纳米颗粒薄膜的电导率可以通过围绕纳米颗粒的可移动抗衡离子和纳米颗粒核上的导电电子的动态，长距离梯度来控制。它们产生的内部梯度和电场很容易重新配置，并且可以通过以下方式设置：可以调节，阻止或什至偏转通过纳米颗粒的电流，以使它们仅通过材料的选定区域。纳米离子/抗衡离子杂化物结合了电子导体与离子凝胶/聚合物的特性，易于通过溶液浇铸进行加工，并且通过控制内部梯度，可以重新配置为不同的电子元件（电流整流器，开关和二极管） </ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.164,Nanochannel electroporation delivers precise amounts of biomolecules into living cells,纳米通道电穿孔将精确数量的生物分子传递到活细胞中 ,"<p>Many transfection techniques can deliver biomolecules into cells, but the dose cannot be controlled precisely. Delivering well-defined amounts of materials into cells is important for various biological studies and therapeutic applications. Here, we show that nanochannel electroporation can deliver precise amounts of a variety of transfection agents into living cells. The device consists of two microchannels connected by a nanochannel. The cell to be transfected is positioned in one microchannel using optical tweezers, and the transfection agent is located in the second microchannel. Delivering a voltage pulse between the microchannels produces an intense electric field over a very small area on the cell membrane, allowing a precise amount of transfection agent to be electrophoretically driven through the nanochannel, the cell membrane and into the cell cytoplasm, without affecting cell viability. Dose control is achieved by adjusting the duration and number of pulses. The nanochannel electroporation device is expected to have high-throughput delivery applications.</p>",<p>许多转染技术可以将生物分子传递到细胞中，但是剂量无法精确控制。对于各种生物学研究和治疗应用而言，将确定数量的材料运送到细胞中非常重要。在这里，我们显示出纳米通道电穿孔可以将精确量的各种转染剂递送到活细胞中。该设备由通过纳米通道连接的两个微通道组成。使用光镊将待转染的细胞置于一个微通道中，将转染剂置于第二个微通道中。在微通道之间传递电压脉冲会在细胞膜上很小的区域上产生一个强电场，从而使精确量的转染剂通过电泳被驱动通过纳米通道，细胞膜并进入细胞质，而不会影响细胞活力。通过调节脉冲的持续时间和数量来实现剂量控制。纳米通道电穿孔装置有望具有高通量的输送应用。</ p>
