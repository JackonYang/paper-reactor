10.1038/nnano.2011.187,Challenges and opportunities for structural DNA nanotechnology,结构DNA纳米技术的挑战与机遇 ,"<p>DNA molecules have been used to build a variety of nanoscale structures and devices over the past 30 years, and potential applications have begun to emerge. But the development of more advanced structures and applications will require a number of issues to be addressed, the most significant of which are the high cost of DNA and the high error rate of self-assembly. Here we examine the technical challenges in the field of structural DNA nanotechnology and outline some of the promising applications that could be developed if these hurdles can be overcome. In particular, we highlight the potential use of DNA nanostructures in molecular and cellular biophysics, as biomimetic systems, in energy transfer and photonics, and in diagnostics and therapeutics for human health.</p>",在过去的30年中，DNA分子已用于构建各种纳米级结构和设备，并且潜在的应用已开始出现。 但是，开发更高级的结构和应用程序将需要解决许多问题，其中最重要的是DNA的成本高和自组装的错误率高。 在这里，我们研究了结构DNA纳米技术领域的技术挑战，并概述了如果可以克服这些障碍可以开发的一些有前途的应用程序。 特别是，我们强调了DNA纳米结构在分子和细胞生物物理学中，作为仿生系统，在能量转移和光子学中以及在人类健康的诊断和治疗中的潜在用途。</ p>

10.1038/nnano.2011.163,A decision-directed approach for prioritizing research into the impact of nanomaterials on the environment and human health,一种决策导向的方法，用于优先研究纳米材料对环境和人类健康的影响 ,"<p>The emergence of nanotechnology has coincided with an increased recognition of the need for new approaches to understand and manage the impact of emerging technologies on the environment and human health. Important elements in these new approaches include life-cycle thinking, public participation and adaptive management of the risks associated with emerging technologies and new materials. However, there is a clear need to develop a framework for linking research on the risks associated with nanotechnology to the decision-making needs of manufacturers, regulators, consumers and other stakeholder groups. Given the very high uncertainties associated with nanomaterials and their impact on the environment and human health, research resources should be directed towards creating the knowledge that is most meaningful to these groups. Here, we present a model (based on multi-criteria decision analysis and a value of information approach) for prioritizing research strategies in a way that is responsive to the recommendations of recent reports on the management of the risk and impact of nanomaterials on the environment and human health.</p>",<p>纳米技术的出现与人们日益认识到需要新方法来理解和管理新兴技术对环境和人类健康的影响有关。这些新方法的重要元素包括生命周期思考，公众参与以及对与新兴技术和新材料相关的风险的适应性管理。但是，显然需要开发一个框架，以将对与纳米技术相关的风险的研究与制造商，监管者，消费者和其他利益相关者团体的决策需求联系起来。考虑到与纳米材料相关的不确定性及其对环境和人类健康的影响，研究资源应直接用于创造对这些群体最有意义的知识。在这里，我们提出了一个模型（基于多标准决策分析和信息方法的价值），该模型以对最新报告中有关纳米材料对环境的风险和影响的管理的建议做出响应的方式对研究策略进行优先级排序和人类健康。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.184,Skin-like pressure and strain sensors based on transparent elastic films of carbon nanotubes,基于碳纳米管透明弹性膜的类似于皮肤的压力和应变传感器 ,"<p>Transparent, elastic conductors are essential components of electronic and optoelectronic devices that facilitate human interaction and biofeedback, such as interactive electronics, implantable medical devices and robotic systems with human-like sensing capabilities. The availability of conducting thin films with these properties could lead to the development of skin-like sensors that stretch reversibly, sense pressure (not just touch), bend into hairpin turns, integrate with collapsible, stretchable and mechanically robust displays and solar cells, and also wrap around non-planar and biological surfaces such as skin and organs, without wrinkling. We report transparent, conducting spray-deposited films of single-walled carbon nanotubes that can be rendered stretchable by applying strain along each axis, and then releasing this strain. This process produces spring-like structures in the nanotubes that accommodate strains of up to 150% and demonstrate conductivities as high as 2,200&#160;S&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;1</sup> in the stretched state. We also use the nanotube films as electrodes in arrays of transparent, stretchable capacitors, which behave as pressure and strain sensors.</p>","<p>透明的弹性导体是促进人类交互和生物反馈的电子和光电设备的基本组成部分，例如交互式电子设备，可植入医疗设备和具有人类感应功能的机器人系统。具有这些特性的导电薄膜的可用性可能会导致开发可逆拉伸，感应压力（而不仅仅是触摸），弯成发夹状，与可折叠，可拉伸且机械坚固的显示器和太阳能电池集成的类似皮肤的传感器，还可以包裹非平面和生物表面，例如皮肤和器官，而不会起皱。我们报告了透明的，导电的单壁碳纳米管喷涂沉积膜，可以通过沿每个轴施加应变，然后释放该应变来使其具有可拉伸性。此过程在纳米管中产生类似弹簧的结构，可承受高达150％的应变，并在拉伸状态下显示出高达2,200＆＃160; S＆＃160; cm <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>的电导率。我们还将纳米管薄膜用作透明，可拉伸电容器阵列中的电极，这些电容器充当压力和应变传感器。</ p> "
10.1038/nnano.2011.182,Positive and negative Coulomb drag in vertically integrated one-dimensional quantum wires,垂直集成一维量子线中的正负库仑阻力 ,"<p>Electron interactions in and between wires become increasingly complex and important as circuits are scaled to nanometre sizes, or use reduced-dimensional conductors such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires and gated high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems. This is because the screening of the long-range Coulomb potential of individual carriers is weakened in these systems, which can lead to phenomena such as Coulomb drag, where a current in one wire induces a voltage in a second wire through Coulomb interactions alone. Previous experiments have demonstrated Coulomb electron drag in wires separated by a soft electrostatic barrier of width &#8819;80 nm (ref.), which was interpreted as resulting entirely from momentum transfer. Here, we measure both positive and negative drag between adjacent vertical quantum wires that are separated by &#8764;15 nm and have independent contacts, which allows their electron densities to be tuned independently. We map out the drag signal versus the number of electron sub-bands occupied in each wire, and interpret the results both in terms of momentum-transfer and charge-fluctuation induced transport models. For wires of significantly different sub-band occupancies, the positive drag effect can be as large as 25%.</p>",随着电路按比例缩放到纳米尺寸，或使用尺寸减小的导体（例如碳纳米管，纳米线和门控高迁移率二维电子系统），导线中和导线之间的电子相互作用变得越来越复杂和重要。这是因为在这些系统中，对单个载流子的远程库仑电势的屏蔽被削弱了，这可能导致诸如库仑阻力的现象，其中一根导线中的电流仅通过库仑相互作用就在第二根导线中感应出电压。先前的实验已经证明了库仑电子在导线中的阻力，该导线被宽度为80 nm（参考）的柔软静电屏障隔开，这完全被解释为是由动量传递引起的。在这里，我们测量了相邻垂直量子线之间的正和负阻力，这些垂直量子线之间相距15纳米并具有独立的触点，从而可以独立调节它们的电子密度。我们绘制出拖曳信号与每条导线中占据的电子子带数的关系图，并根据动量转移和电荷波动诱导的输运模型解释结果。对于子带占用率明显不同的导线，其正阻力效应可能高达25％。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.189,Electric-field-induced wetting and dewetting in single hydrophobic nanopores,电场在单个疏水性纳米孔中的润湿和反润湿 ,"<p>The behaviour of water in nanopores is very different from that of bulk water. Close to hydrophobic surfaces, the water density has been found to be lower than in the bulk, and if confined in a sufficiently narrow hydrophobic nanopore, water can spontaneously evaporate. Molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that a nanopore can be switched between dry and wet states by applying an electric potential across the nanopore membrane. Nanopores with hydrophobic walls could therefore create a gate system for water, and also for ionic and neutral species. Here, we show that single hydrophobic nanopores can undergo reversible wetting and dewetting due to condensation and evaporation of water inside the pores. The reversible process is observed as fluctuations between conducting and non-conducting ionic states and can be regulated by a transmembrane electric potential.</p>",<p>水在纳米孔中的行为与散装水有很大不同。 在疏水表面附近，发现水密度低于整体，并且如果限制在足够窄的疏水纳米孔中，水会自发蒸发。 分子动力学模拟表明，通过在纳米孔膜上施加电势，可以在干态和湿态之间切换纳米孔。 因此，具有疏水壁的纳米孔可以为水以及离子和中性物质创造出一个闸门系统。 在这里，我们表明由于孔内水的凝结和蒸发，单个疏水性纳米孔可以经历可逆的润湿和反润湿。 可逆过程被观察为导电和非导电离子态之间的波动，并且可以通过跨膜电位来调节。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.183,Formation of droplet networks that function in aqueous environments,在水环境中起作用的液滴网络的形成 ,"<p>Aqueous droplets in oil that are coated with lipid monolayers and joined through interface bilayers are useful for biophysical measurements on membrane proteins. Functional networks of droplets that can act as light sensors, batteries and electrical components can also be made by incorporating pumps, channels and pores into the bilayers. These networks of droplets mimic simple tissues, but so far have not been used in physiological environments because they have been constrained to a bulk oil phase. Here, we form structures called multisomes in which networks of aqueous droplets with defined compositions are encapsulated within small drops of oil in water. The encapsulated droplets adhere to one another and to the surface of the oil drop to form interface bilayers that allow them to communicate with each other and with the surrounding aqueous environment through membrane pores. The contents in the droplets can be released by changing the pH or temperature of the surrounding solution. The multicompartment framework of multisomes mimics a tissue and has potential applications in synthetic biology and medicine.</p>",涂有脂质单层并通过界面双层结合的油中水滴可用于膜蛋白的生物物理测量。通过将泵，通道和孔合并到双层中，还可以形成可用作光传感器，电池和电气组件的液滴功能网络。这些液滴网络模仿简单的组织，但是由于它们已被限制在散装油相中，因此至今尚未在生理环境中使用。在这里，我们形成了称为多核糖体的结构，其中具有确定组成的水滴网络被封装在水中的小滴油中。包封的液滴彼此粘附，并粘附到油滴的表面，形成界面双层，从而使它们彼此之间以及通过膜孔与周围的水性环境连通。液滴中的内容物可以通过改变周围溶液的pH或温度来释放。多体的多隔室框架模仿组织，在合成生物学和医学中具有潜在的应用。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.186,Mapping nanomechanical properties of live cells using multi-harmonic atomic force microscopy,使用多谐波原子力显微镜绘制活细胞的纳米力学特性图 ,"<p>The nanomechanical properties of living cells, such as their surface elastic response and adhesion, have important roles in cellular processes such as morphogenesis, mechano-transduction, focal adhesion, motility, metastasis and drug delivery. Techniques based on quasi-static atomic force microscopy techniques can map these properties, but they lack the spatial and temporal resolution that is needed to observe many of the relevant details. Here, we present a dynamic atomic force microscopy method to map quantitatively the nanomechanical properties of live cells with a throughput (measured in pixels/minute) that is &#8764;10&#8211;1,000 times higher than that achieved with quasi-static atomic force microscopy techniques. The local properties of a cell are derived from the 0th, 1st and 2nd harmonic components of the Fourier spectrum of the AFM cantilevers interacting with the cell surface. Local stiffness, stiffness gradient and the viscoelastic dissipation of live Escherichia coli bacteria, rat fibroblasts and human red blood cells were all mapped in buffer solutions. Our method is compatible with commercial atomic force microscopes and could be used to analyse mechanical changes in tumours, cells and biofilm formation with sub-10&#160;nm detail.</p>",<p>活细胞的纳米机械性能，例如其表面弹性反应和粘附，在细胞形成过程中起重要作用，例如形态发生，机械传导，局部粘附，运动性，转移和药物传递。基于准静态原子力显微镜技术的技术可以映射这些属性，但它们缺乏观察许多相关细节所需的时空分辨率。在这里，我们提出了一种动态原子力显微镜方法，用于定量绘制活细胞的纳米力学性能，其吞吐量（以像素/分钟为单位）是准静态原子的通量的1000倍（以10像素为单位）。力显微镜技术。单元格的局部特性是从AFM悬臂与单元格表面相互作用的傅立叶光谱的0、1和2次谐波分量中得出的。活大肠杆菌，大鼠成纤维细胞和人红细胞的局部刚度，刚度梯度和粘弹性消散都绘制在缓冲溶液中。我们的方法与商业原子力显微镜兼容，可用于分析肿瘤，细胞和生物膜形成的机械变化，亚细度小于10nm。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.166,Accumulation of sub-100 nm polymeric micelles in poorly permeable tumours depends on size,渗透性差的肿瘤中100 nm以下聚合胶束的积累取决于大小 ,"<p>A major goal in cancer research is to develop carriers that can deliver drugs effectively and without side effects. Liposomal and particulate carriers with diameters of &#8764;100 nm have been widely used to improve the distribution and tumour accumulation of cancer drugs, but so far they have only been effective for treating highly permeable tumours. Here, we compare the accumulation and effectiveness of different sizes of long-circulating, drug-loaded polymeric micelles (with diameters of 30, 50, 70 and 100 nm) in both highly and poorly permeable tumours. All the polymer micelles penetrated highly permeable tumours in mice, but only the 30 nm micelles could penetrate poorly permeable pancreatic tumours to achieve an antitumour effect. We also showed that the penetration and efficacy of the larger micelles could be enhanced by using a transforming growth factor-&#946; inhibitor to increase the permeability of the tumours.</p>",<p>癌症研究的主要目标是开发可以有效递送药物且没有副作用的载体。 直径为100nm的脂质体和颗粒载体已被广泛用于改善抗癌药物的分布和肿瘤蓄积，但到目前为止，它们仅对治疗高渗透性肿瘤有效。 在这里，我们比较了不同大小的长循环，载药量高的聚合物胶束（直径分别为30、50、70和100 nm）在高渗透性和低渗透性肿瘤中的积累和有效性。 所有的聚合物胶束都可以穿透小鼠的高渗透性肿瘤，但是只有30 nm的胶束可以穿透低渗透性的胰腺肿瘤，以达到抗肿瘤作用。 我们还表明，通过使用转化生长因子-＆＃946;可以提高较大胶束的渗透性和功效。 抑制剂以增加肿瘤的通透性。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.188,Signalling of DNA damage and cytokines across cell barriers exposed to nanoparticles depends on barrier thickness,跨越暴露于纳米颗粒的细胞屏障的DNA损伤和细胞因子信号传导取决于屏障厚度 ,"<p>The use of nanoparticles in medicine is ever increasing, and it is important to understand their targeted and non-targeted effects. We have previously shown that nanoparticles can cause DNA damage to cells cultured below a cellular barrier without crossing this barrier. Here, we show that this indirect DNA damage depends on the thickness of the cellular barrier, and it is mediated by signalling through gap junction proteins following the generation of mitochondrial free radicals. Indirect damage was seen across both trophoblast and corneal barriers. Signalling, including cytokine release, occurred only across bilayer and multilayer barriers, but not across monolayer barriers. Indirect toxicity was also observed in mice and using ex vivo explants of the human placenta. If the importance of barrier thickness in signalling is a general feature for all types of barriers, our results may offer a principle with which to limit the adverse effects of nanoparticle exposure and offer new therapeutic approaches.</p>",<p>纳米颗粒在医学中的用途正在不断增加，了解其靶向和非靶向作用非常重要。先前我们已经证明，纳米粒子可以对细胞屏障以下培养的细胞造成DNA损伤，而不会越过该屏障。在这里，我们表明这种间接的DNA损伤取决于细胞屏障的厚度，并且它是通过线粒体自由基产生后通过间隙连接蛋白的信号传导来介导的。在滋养层和角膜屏障上都发现了间接损伤。包括细胞因子释放在内的信号传导仅发生在双层和多层屏障上，而不发生在单层屏障上。在小鼠和使用人胎盘的离体外植体中也观察到间接毒性。如果屏障厚度在信号传导中的重要性是所有类型屏障的普遍特征，那么我们的结果可能提供了一个原理，可以限制纳米颗粒暴露的不利影响并提供新的治疗方法。</ p>
