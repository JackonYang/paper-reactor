10.1038/nnano.2011.235,Probing and repairing damaged surfaces with nanoparticle-containing microcapsules,用含纳米颗粒的微胶囊探测和修复受损表面 ,"<p>Nanoparticles have useful properties, but it is often important that they only start working after they are placed in a desired location. The encapsulation of nanoparticles allows their function to be preserved until they are released at a specific time or location, and this has been exploited in the development of self-healing materials and in applications such as drug delivery. Encapsulation has also been used to stabilize and control the release of substances, including flavours, fragrances and pesticides. We recently proposed a new technique for the repair of surfaces called &#8216;repair-and-go&#8217;. In this approach, a flexible microcapsule filled with a solution of nanoparticles rolls across a surface that has been damaged, stopping to repair any defects it encounters by releasing nanoparticles into them, then moving on to the next defect. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the repair-and-go approach using droplets of oil that are stabilized with a polymer surfactant and contain CdSe nanoparticles. We show that these microcapsules can find the cracks on a surface and selectively deliver the nanoparticle contents into the crack, before moving on to find the next crack. Although the microcapsules are too large to enter the cracks, their flexible walls allow them to probe and adhere temporarily to the interior of the cracks. The release of nanoparticles is made possible by the thin microcapsule wall (comparable to the diameter of the nanoparticles) and by the favourable (hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic) interactions between the nanoparticle and the cracked surface.</p>",<p>纳米颗粒具有有用的特性，但是通常很重要的一点是它们只有在放置在所需的位置后才能开始工作。纳米颗粒的包封可以保留其功能，直到它们在特定的时间或位置释放为止，这已被用于自我修复材料的开发和药物递送等应用中。包封也已用于稳定和控制包括调味剂，香料和农药在内的物质的释放。我们最近提出了一种修复表面的新技术，称为“修复并移动”。在这种方法中，填充有纳米颗粒溶液的柔性微胶囊会在受损的表面上滚动，通过将纳米颗粒释放到其中而停止修复所遇到的任何缺陷，然后继续处理下一个缺陷。在这里，我们通过实验证明了使用聚合物表面活性剂稳定并含有CdSe纳米粒子的油滴修复和修复的方法。我们表明，这些微胶囊可以在表面上找到裂缝，并在继续寻找下一个裂缝之前将纳​​米颗粒的内含物选择性地输送到裂缝中。尽管微胶囊太大而无法进入裂缝，但它们的柔性壁使它们能够探测并暂时粘附在裂缝内部。薄的微囊壁（与纳米颗粒的直径相当）和纳米颗粒与破裂表面之间的良好（疏水）相互作用使得纳米颗粒的释放成为可能。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.216,Enhanced and switchable nanoscale thermal conduction due to van der Waals interfaces,由于范德华界面，增强了可切换的纳米级热传导 ,"<p>Understanding thermal transport in nanostructured materials is important for the development of energy conversion applications and the thermal management of microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. Most nanostructures interact through van der Waals interactions, and these interactions typically lead to a reduction in thermal transport. Here, we show that the thermal conductivity of a bundle of boron nanoribbons can be significantly higher than that of a single free-standing nanoribbon. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of the bundle can be switched between the enhanced values and that of a single nanoribbon by wetting the van der Waals interface between the nanoribbons with various solutions.</p>",<p>了解纳米结构材料中的热传输对能量转换应用程序的开发以及微电子和光电器件的热管理非常重要。 大多数纳米结构通过范德华相互作用进行相互作用，这些相互作用通常会导致热传递减少。 在这里，我们表明一束硼纳米带的热导率可以显着高于单个自立纳米带的热导率。 此外，通过用各种溶液润湿纳米带之间的范德华界面，可以将束的热导率在增强值和单个纳米带的热导率之间进行切换。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.214,Control over topological insulator photocurrents with light polarization,利用光偏振控制拓扑绝缘子光电流 ,"<p>Three-dimensional topological insulators represent a new quantum phase of matter with spin-polarized surface states that are protected from backscattering. The static electronic properties of these surface states have been comprehensively imaged by both photoemission and tunnelling spectroscopies. Theorists have proposed that topological surface states can also exhibit novel electronic responses to light, such as topological quantum phase transitions and spin-polarized electrical currents. However, the effects of optically driving a topological insulator out of equilibrium have remained largely unexplored experimentally, and no photocurrents have been measured. Here, we show that illuminating the topological insulator Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> with circularly polarized light generates a photocurrent that originates from topological helical Dirac fermions, and that reversing the helicity of the light reverses the direction of the photocurrent. We also observe a photocurrent that is controlled by the linear polarization of light and argue that it may also have a topological surface state origin. This approach may allow the probing of dynamic properties of topological insulators and lead to novel opto-spintronic devices.</p>",<p>三维拓扑绝缘体代表具有自旋极化表面态的物质的新量子相，可防止其反向散射。这些表面态的静态电子性质已通过光发射和隧穿光谱学得到了全面成像。理论家提出，拓扑表面状态还可以表现出对光的新型电子响应，例如拓扑量子相变和自旋极化电流。但是，光学驱使拓扑绝缘体失衡的效果在实验上仍未得到充分探索，也没有测量到光电流。在这里，我们表明，用圆偏振光照射拓扑绝缘体Bi <sub> 2 </ sub> Se <sub> 3 </ sub>会产生源自拓扑螺旋狄拉克费米子的光电流，并且会反转光的螺旋度反转光电流的方向。我们还观察到由光的线性偏振控制的光电流，并认为它也可能具有拓扑表面状态起源。这种方法可以探究拓扑绝缘子的动态特性，并产生新颖的光电自旋电子器件。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.213,Solid-state memories based on ferroelectric tunnel junctions,基于铁电隧道结的固态存储器 ,"<p>Ferroic-order parameters are useful as state variables in non-volatile information storage media because they show a hysteretic dependence on their electric or magnetic field. Coupling ferroics with quantum-mechanical tunnelling allows a simple and fast readout of the stored information through the influence of ferroic orders on the tunnel current. For example, data in magnetic random-access memories are stored in the relative alignment of two ferromagnetic electrodes separated by a non-magnetic tunnel barrier, and data readout is accomplished by a tunnel current measurement. However, such devices based on tunnel magnetoresistance typically exhibit OFF/ON ratios of less than 4, and require high powers for write operations (&gt;1&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>6</sup>&#160;A&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup>). Here, we report non-volatile memories with OFF/ON ratios as high as 100 and write powers as low as &#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup>&#160;A&#160;cm<sup>&#8722;2</sup> at room temperature by storing data in the electric polarization direction of a ferroelectric tunnel barrier. The junctions show large, stable, reproducible and reliable tunnel electroresistance, with resistance switching occurring at the coercive voltage of ferroelectric switching. These ferroelectric devices emerge as an alternative to other resistive memories, and have the advantage of not being based on voltage-induced migration of matter at the nanoscale, but on a purely electronic mechanism.</p>",<p>铁定序参数在非易失性信息存储介质中可用作状态变量，因为它们显示出对其电场或磁场的滞后依赖性。通过铁磁阶数对隧道电流的影响，将铁磁与量子力学隧穿耦合可以简单，快速地读取存储的信息。例如，将磁性随机存取存储器中的数据存储在被非磁性隧道势垒隔开的两个铁磁电极的相对对准中，并且通过隧道电流测量来完成数据读出。但是，这种基于隧道磁阻的器件通常显示的OFF / ON比率小于4，并且需要高功率才能进行写操作（＆gt; 1＆＃160;＆＃215;＆＃160; 10 <sup> 6 </ sup> ＆＃160; A＆＃160; cm <sup>＆＃8722; 2 </ sup>）。在这里，我们报告的非易失性存储器的OFF / ON比率高达100，写入功率低至＆＃8764; 1＆＃215;。通过在铁电隧道势垒的极化方向上存储数据，在室温下为10 <sup> 4 </ sup>＆amp; A＆＃160; cm <sup>＆＃8722; 2 </ sup>。结表现出大的，稳定的，可再现的和可靠的隧道电阻，并且在铁电开关的矫顽电压下发生电阻开关。这些铁电器件可以替代其他电阻式存储器，并且具有的优势不是基于电压诱导的纳米级物质迁移，而是基于纯电子机制。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.224,High-dynamic-range magnetometry with a single nuclear spin in diamond,金刚石单核自旋的高动态范围磁力计 ,"<p>Sensors based on the nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond are being developed to measure weak magnetic and electric fields at the nanoscale. However, such sensors rely on measurements of a shift in the Lamor frequency of the defect, so an accumulation of quantum phase causes the measurement signal to exhibit a periodic modulation. This means that the measurement time is either restricted to half of one oscillation period, which limits accuracy, or that the magnetic field range must be known in advance. Moreover, the precision increases only slowly (as T<sup>&#8722;0.5</sup>) with measurement time T (ref.&#160;). Here, we implement a quantum phase estimation algorithm on a single nuclear spin in diamond to combine both high sensitivity and high dynamic range. By achieving a scaling of the precision with time to T<sup>&#8722;0.85</sup>, we improve the sensitivity by a factor of 7.4 for an accessible field range of 16&#160;mT, or, alternatively, we improve the dynamic range by a factor of 130 for a sensitivity of 2.5&#160;&#181;T&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>. Quantum phase estimation algorithms have also recently been implemented using a single electron spin in a nitrogen-vacancy centre. These methods are applicable to a variety of field detection schemes, and do not require quantum entanglement.</p>",<p>正在开发基于金刚石中氮空位缺陷的传感器，以测量纳米级的弱磁场和电场。然而，这样的传感器依赖于缺陷的劳模频率的偏移的测量，因此量子相位的累积导致测量信号表现出周期性的调制。这意味着测量时间被限制为一个振荡周期的一半，这限制了精度，或者必须事先知道磁场范围。而且，随着测量时间T（ref。＆＃160;），精度仅缓慢增加（作为T <sup>＆＃8722; 0.5 </ sup>）。在这里，我们对钻石的单个核自旋实施量子相估计算法，以结合高灵敏度和高动态范围。通过实现精度随时间缩放至T <sup>＆＃8722; 0.85 </ sup>，对于16＆＃160; mT的可访问字段范围，我们将灵敏度提高了7.4倍，或者，将动态范围提高130倍，以使灵敏度达到2.5＆lt; T＆＃160; Hz <sup>＆＃8722; 1/2 </ sup>。最近，在氮空位中心使用单电子自旋实现了量子相位估计算法。这些方法适用于多种场检测方案，不需要量子纠缠。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.225,High-dynamic-range magnetometry with a single electronic spin in diamond,金刚石单电子自旋的高动态范围磁力计 ,"<p>Magnetic sensors capable of detecting nanoscale volumes of spins allow for non-invasive, element-specific probing. The error in such measurements is usually reduced by increasing the measurement time, and noise averaging the signal. However, achieving the best precision requires restricting the maximum possible field strength to much less than the spectral linewidth of the sensor. Quantum entanglement and squeezing can then be used to improve precision (although they are difficult to implement in solid-state environments). When the field strength is comparable to or greater than the spectral linewidth, an undesirable trade-off between field strength and signal precision occurs. Here, we implement novel phase estimation algorithms on a single electronic spin associated with the nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond to achieve an &#8764;8.5-fold improvement in the ratio of the maximum field strength to precision, for field magnitudes that are large (&#8764;0.3 mT) compared to the spectral linewidth of the sensor (&#8764;4.5 &#181;T). The field uncertainty in our approach scales as 1/T<sup>0.88</sup>, compared to 1/T<sup>0.5</sup> in the standard measurement approach, where T is the measurement time. Quantum phase estimation algorithms have also recently been implemented using a single nuclear spin in a nitrogen-vacancy centre. Besides their direct impact on applications in magnetic sensing and imaging at the nanoscale, these results may prove useful in improving a variety of high-precision spectroscopy techniques.</p>",<p>能够检测自旋的纳米级体积的磁性传感器允许进行非侵入性的，特定于元素的探测。通常可以通过增加测量时间和平均信号噪声来减少此类测量中的误差。但是，要获得最佳精度，就必须将最大可能的场强限制为远小于传感器的光谱线宽。然后可以使用量子纠缠和压缩来提高精度（尽管它们很难在固态环境中实现）。当场强等于或大于频谱线宽时，会在场强和信号精度之间发生不希望的折衷。在这里，我们在与金刚石中的氮空位缺陷中心相关的单个电子自旋上实现了新颖的相位估计算法，以实现最大场强与精度之比达到8.5倍的改进，对于与传感器的光谱线宽（＆＃8764; 4.5＆＃181; T）相比更大（＆＃8764; 0.3 mT）。与标准测量方法中的1 / T <sup> 0.5 </ sup>相比，我们的方法中的场不确定度为1 / T <sup> 0.88 </ sup>，其中T是测量时间。最近在氮空位中心使用单核自旋实现了量子相位估计算法。除了直接影响纳米级磁感测和成像中的应用外，这些结果还可能有助于改进各种高精度光谱技术。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.243,Ultrafast hot-carrier-dominated photocurrent in graphene,石墨烯中超快的热载流子为主的光电流 ,"<p>The combination of its high electron mobility, broadband absorption and ultrafast luminescence make graphene attractive for optoelectronic and photonic applications, including transparent electrodes, mode-locked lasers and high-speed optical modulators. Photo-excited carriers that have not cooled to the temperature of the graphene lattice are known as hot carriers, and may limit device speed and energy efficiency. However, their roles in charge and energy transport are not fully understood. Here, we use time-resolved scanning photocurrent microscopy to demonstrate that hot carriers, rather than phonons, dominate energy transport across a tunable graphene p&#8211;n junction excited by ultrafast laser pulses. The photocurrent response time varies from 1.5 ps at room temperature to 4 ps at 20 K, implying a fundamental bandwidth of &#8764;500 GHz (refs). Gate-dependent pump&#8211;probe measurements demonstrate that both thermoelectric and built-in electric field effects contribute to the photocurrent, with the contribution from each depending on the junction configuration. The photocurrent produced by a single pulsed laser also displays multiple polarity reversals as a function of carrier density, which is a possible signature of impact ionization.</p>",<p>其高电子迁移率，宽带吸收和超快发光的结合使石墨烯对光电和光子应用具有吸引力，包括透明电极，锁模激光器和高速光调制器。尚未冷却至石墨烯晶格温度的光激发载流子称为热载流子，可能会限制器件的速度和能效。但是，它们在电荷和能量传输中的作用尚未完全了解。在这里，我们使用时间分辨扫描光电流显微镜来证明，热载流子而不是声子主导着由超快激光脉冲激发的可调谐石墨烯p＆＃8211n结的能量传输。光电流响应时间从室温下的1.5 ps变化到20 K时的4 ps，这意味着基本带宽为＆＃8764; 500 GHz（参考）。依赖于门的泵的探针测量结果表明，热电效应和内置电场效应都对光电流有贡献，每种影响都取决于结的配置。单脉冲激光产生的光电流还显示出与载流子密度有关的多个极性反转，这可能是碰撞电离的标志。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.217,Local electrical potential detection of DNA by nanowire–nanopore sensors,纳米线-纳米孔传感器检测DNA的局部电势 ,"<p>Nanopores could potentially be used to perform single-molecule DNA sequencing at low cost and with high throughput. Although single base resolution and differentiation have been demonstrated with nanopores using ionic current measurements, direct sequencing has not been achieved because of the difficulties in recording very small (&#8764;pA) ionic currents at a bandwidth consistent with fast translocation speeds. Here, we show that solid-state nanopores can be combined with silicon nanowire field-effect transistors to create sensors in which detection is localized and self-aligned at the nanopore. Well-defined field-effect transistor signals associated with DNA translocation are recorded when an ionic strength gradient is imposed across the nanopores. Measurements and modelling show that field-effect transistor signals are generated by highly localized changes in the electrical potential during DNA translocation, and that nanowire&#8211;nanopore sensors could enable large-scale integration with a high intrinsic bandwidth.</p>",纳米孔可以潜在地以低成本和高通量进行单分子DNA测序。尽管已使用离子电流测量技术对纳米孔进行了单碱基拆分和区分，但由于难以在与快速转运速度一致的带宽下记录非常小的（pA）离子电流方面的困难，因此无法实现直接测序。在这里，我们展示了固态纳米孔可以与硅纳米线场效应晶体管相结合，以创建传感器，其中检测在纳米孔处进行本地化和自对准。当跨纳米孔施加离子强度梯度时，会记录与DNA易位相关的定义明确的场效应晶体管信号。测量和建模表明，场效应晶体管信号是由DNA移位过程中电位的高度局部变化产生的，并且纳米线纳米孔传感器可以实现具有高固有带宽的大规模集成。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.227,Photoluminescence imaging of electronic-impurity-induced exciton quenching in single-walled carbon nanotubes,单壁碳纳米管中电子杂质诱导的激子猝灭的光致发光成像 ,"<p>The electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes can be altered by surface adsorption of electronic impurities or dopants. However, fully understanding the influence of these impurities is difficult because of the inherent complexity of the solution-based colloidal chemistry of nanotubes, and because of a lack of techniques for directly imaging dynamic processes involving these impurities. Here, we show that photoluminescence microscopy can be used to image exciton quenching in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes during the early stages of chemical doping with two different species. The addition of AuCl<sub>3</sub> leads to localized exciton-quenching sites, which are attributed to a mid-gap electronic impurity level, and the adsorbed species are also found sometimes to be mobile on the surface of the nanotubes. The addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> leads to delocalized exciton-quenching hole states, which are responsible for long-range photoluminescence blinking, and are also mobile.</p>",<p>单壁碳纳米管的电子特性可以通过电子杂质或掺杂剂的表面吸附来改变。然而，由于纳米管的基于溶液的胶体化学的内在复杂性，并且由于缺乏直接成像涉及这些杂质的动态过程的技术，因此难以完全理解这些杂质的影响。在这里，我们显示光致发光显微镜可用于在化学掺杂两种不同物质的早期阶段，对半导体单壁碳纳米管中的激子猝灭进行成像。 AuCl <sub> 3 </ sub>的添加导致局部激子猝灭位点，这归因于中间带隙的电子杂质水平，有时还发现被吸附的物质在纳米管的表面上是可移动的。 H <sub> 2 </ sub> O <sub> 2 </ sub>的添加会导致离域激子猝灭空穴状态，该状态导致远距离光致发光闪烁，并且可以移动。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.240,Electrophoretically induced aqueous flow through single-walled carbon nanotube membranes,电泳诱导的水流通过单壁碳纳米管膜 ,"<p>Electrophoresis, the motion of charged species through liquids and pores under the influence of an external electric field, has been the principle source of chemical pumping for numerous micro- and nanofluidic device platforms. Recent measurements of ion currents through single or few carbon nanotube channels have yielded values of ion mobility that range from close to the bulk mobility to values that are two to seven orders of magnitude higher than the bulk mobility. However, these experiments cannot directly measure ion flux. Experiments on membranes that contain a large number of nanotube pores allow the ion current and ion flux to be measured independently. Here, we report that the mobilities of ions within such membranes are approximately three times higher than the bulk mobility. Moreover, the induced electro-osmotic velocities are four orders of magnitude faster than those measured in conventional porous materials. We also show that a nanotube membrane can function as a rectifying diode due to ionic steric effects within the nanotubes.</p>",电泳是带电物质在外部电场的影响下通过液体和孔的运动，已成为许多微流体和纳米流体设备平台化学泵送的主要来源。最近对通过单个或几个碳纳米管通道的离子电流的测量得出的离子迁移率值范围从接近于迁移率到比迁移率高出两个到七个数量级的值。但是，这些实验无法直接测量离子通量。在包含大量纳米管孔的膜上进行的实验允许独立测量离子电流和离子通量。在这里，我们报道离子在这种膜内的迁移率大约比整体迁移率高三倍。而且，感应电渗速度比常规多孔材料中测得的速度快四个数量级。我们还表明，由于纳米管内的离子空间效应，纳米管膜可以用作整流二极管。</ p>
