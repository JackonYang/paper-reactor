10.1038/nnano.2011.250,A local optical probe for measuring motion and stress in a nanoelectromechanical system,用于测量纳米机电系统中的运动和应力的局部光学探头 ,"<p>Nanoelectromechanical systems can be operated as ultrasensitive mass sensors and ultrahigh-frequency resonators, and can also be used to explore fundamental physical phenomena such as nonlinear damping and quantum effects in macroscopic objects. Various dissipation mechanisms are known to limit the mechanical quality factors of nanoelectromechanical systems and to induce aging due to material degradation, so there is a need for methods that can probe the motion of these systems, and the stresses within them, at the nanoscale. Here, we report a non-invasive local optical probe for the quantitative measurement of motion and stress within a nanoelectromechanical system, based on Fizeau interferometry and Raman spectroscopy. The system consists of a multilayer graphene resonator that is clamped to a gold film on an oxidized silicon surface. The resonator and the surface both act as mirrors and therefore define an optical cavity. Fizeau interferometry provides a calibrated measurement of the motion of the resonator, while Raman spectroscopy can probe the strain within the system and allows a purely spectral detection of mechanical resonance at the nanoscale.</p>",纳米机电系统可以用作超灵敏的质量传感器和超高频谐振器，还可以用于探索基本的物理现象，例如宏观物体中的非线性阻尼和量子效应。已知各种耗散机制会限制纳米机电系统的机械品质因数，并由于材料降解而引起老化，因此需要一种可以探测这些系统的运动以及纳米级应力的方法。在这里，我们报告了一种基于Fizeau干涉测量法和拉曼光谱法的定量测量纳米机电系统内运动和应力的非侵入性局部光学探头。该系统由多层石墨烯谐振器组成，该谐振器夹在氧化硅表面的金膜上。谐振器和表面都充当镜子，因此定义了一个光学腔。 Fizeau干涉测量法可以对谐振器的运动进行校准，而拉曼光谱仪可以探测系统内部的应变，并可以对纳米级的机械谐振进行纯粹的光谱检测。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.251,Transport spectroscopy of symmetry-broken insulating states in bilayer graphene,双层石墨烯中对称破坏的绝缘态的传输光谱 ,"<p>Bilayer graphene is an attractive platform for studying new two-dimensional electron physics, because its flat energy bands are sensitive to out-of-plane electric fields and these bands magnify electron&#8211;electron interaction effects. Theory predicts a variety of interesting broken symmetry states when the electron density is at the carrier neutrality point, and some of these states are characterized by spontaneous mass gaps, which lead to insulating behaviour. These proposed gaps are analogous to the masses generated by broken symmetries in particle physics, and they give rise to large Berry phase effects accompanied by spontaneous quantum Hall effects. Although recent experiments have provided evidence for strong electronic correlations near the charge neutrality point, the presence of gaps remains controversial. Here, we report transport measurements in ultraclean double-gated bilayer graphene and use source&#8211;drain bias as a spectroscopic tool to resolve a gap of &#8764;2 meV at the charge neutrality point. The gap can be closed by a perpendicular electric field of strength &#8764;15 mV nm<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, but it increases monotonically with magnetic field, with an apparent particle&#8211;hole asymmetry above the gap. These data represent the first spectroscopic mapping of the ground states in bilayer graphene in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields.</p>",<p>双层石墨烯是研究新型二维电子物理的极具吸引力的平台，因为其平坦的能带对平面外电场很敏感，并且这些能带会放大电子与电子的相互作用。理论上，当电子密度处于载流子中性点时，会预测出各种有趣的破坏对称状态，其中一些状态的特征是自发的质量间隙，从而导致绝缘行为。这些拟议的间隙类似于粒子物理学中对称性破裂产生的质量，并且会引起大的贝里相效应和自发的量子霍尔效应。尽管最近的实验提供了在电荷中性点附近存在强电子相关性的证据，但间隙的存在仍存在争议。在这里，我们报告了超净双层门石墨烯中的传输测量，并使用源漏偏压作为分光镜工具来解决电荷中性点处的2 meV间隙。间隙可以通过强度为＆＃8764; 15 mV nm <sup>＆＃8722; 1 </ sup>的垂直电场来封闭，但它会随磁场单调增加，并且具有明显的孔洞不对称性差距。这些数据代表了在存在电场和磁场的情况下双层石墨烯中基态的第一光谱映射。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.252,Atomically localized plasmon enhancement in monolayer graphene,单层石墨烯中的原子局部等离子体激元增强 ,"<p>Plasmons in graphene can be tuned by using electrostatic gating or chemical doping, and the ability to confine plasmons in very small regions could have applications in optoelectronics, plasmonics and transformation optics. However, little is known about how atomic-scale defects influence the plasmonic properties of graphene. Moreover, the smallest localized plasmon resonance observed in any material to date has been limited to around 10&#160;nm (refs&#160;). Here, we show that surface plasmon resonances in graphene can be enhanced locally at the atomic scale. Using electron energy-loss spectrum imaging in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope, we find that a single point defect can act as an atomic antenna in the petahertz (10<sup>15</sup>&#160;Hz) frequency range, leading to surface plasmon resonances at the subnanometre scale.</p>",可以通过使用静电门控或化学掺杂来调节石墨烯中的等离子，并且在非常小的区域内限制等离激元的能力可能会在光电，等离子和转换光学中得到应用。 但是，关于原子级缺陷如何影响石墨烯的等离子体性能尚鲜为人知。 而且，迄今为止，在任何材料中观察到的最小的局部等离激元共振都被限制在约10nm（refs）。 在这里，我们表明石墨烯中的表面等离振子共振可以在原子尺度上局部增强。 在像差校正的扫描透射电子显微镜中使用电子能量损失谱成像技术，我们发现单点缺陷可以充当10赫兹（10 <sup> 15 </ sup>＆＃160; Hz）频率中的原子天线 范围，导致亚微米级的表面等离振子共振。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.2,Direct observation of the spin-dependent Peltier effect,直接观察自旋相关的珀耳帖效应 ,"<p>The Peltier coefficient describes the amount of heat that is carried by an electrical current when it passes through a material. When two materials with different Peltier coefficients are placed in contact with one another, the Peltier effect causes a net flow of heat either towards or away from the interface between them. Spintronics describes the transport of electric charge and spin angular momentum by separate spin-up and spin-down channels in a device. The observation that spin-up and spin-down charge transport channels are able to transport heat independently of each other has raised the possibility that spin currents could be used to heat or cool the interface between materials with different spin-dependent Peltier coefficients. Here, we report the direct observation of the heating and cooling of such an interface by a spin current. We demonstrate this spin-dependent Peltier effect in a spin-valve pillar structure that consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-ferromagnetic metal. Using a three-dimensional finite-element model, we extract spin-dependent Peltier coefficients in the range &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.3&#160;mV for permalloy. The magnetic control of heat flow could prove useful for the cooling of nanoscale electronic components or devices.</p>",<p>珀耳帖系数描述了电流通过材料时所携带的热量。当两种具有不同珀尔帖系数的材料相互接触时，珀尔帖效应会导致热量净流向或远离它们之间的界面。自旋电子学描述了设备中分离的自旋向上和向下旋转通道对电荷和自旋角动量的传输。自旋向上和自旋向下的电荷传输通道能够彼此独立地传输热量的观察结果提出了自旋电流可以用于加热或冷却具有不同自旋相关珀尔帖系数的材料之间的界面的可能性。在这里，我们报告了通过自旋电流对这种界面的加热和冷却的直接观察。我们在由两个由非铁磁金属分隔的铁磁层组成的自旋阀柱结构中证明了这种自旋相关的珀耳帖效应。使用三维有限元模型，提取坡莫合金的自旋相关Peltier系数，其范围为0.9到0.3872 mV。磁控制热流可以证明对冷却纳米级电子元件或器件很有用。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.253,A DNA-based molecular motor that can navigate a network of tracks,基于DNA的分子马达，可以在轨道网络中导航 ,"<p>Synthetic molecular motors can be fuelled by the hydrolysis or hybridization of DNA. Such motors can move autonomously and programmably, and long-range transport has been observed on linear tracks. It has also been shown that DNA systems can compute. Here, we report a synthetic DNA-based system that integrates long-range transport and information processing. We show that the path of a motor through a network of tracks containing four possible routes can be programmed using instructions that are added externally or carried by the motor itself. When external control is used we find that 87% of the motors follow the correct path, and when internal control is used 71% of the motors follow the correct path. Programmable motion will allow the development of computing networks, molecular systems that can sort and process cargoes according to instructions that they carry, and assembly lines that can be reconfigured dynamically in response to changing demands.</p>",可以通过DNA的水解或杂交来为合成分子马达提供燃料。 这样的电动机可以自主地和可编程地运动，并且在线性轨道上已经观察到远距离运输。 还显示出DNA系统可以计算。 在这里，我们报告了一个基于DNA的合成系统，该系统集成了远程运输和信息处理功能。 我们表明，可以使用外部添加的指令或由电动机本身携带的指令来编程通过包含四个可能路径的轨道网络的电动机路径。 当使用外部控制时，我们发现87％的电动机遵循正确的路径，而当使用内部控制时，71％的电动机遵循正确的路径。 可编程的运动将允许开发计算网络，可以根据所携带的指令对货物进行分类和处理的分子系统，以及可以根据不断变化的需求而动态重新配置的装配线。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.223,Intracellular recordings of action potentials by an extracellular nanoscale field-effect transistor,细胞外纳米级场效应晶体管的动作电位的细胞内记录 ,"<p>The ability to make electrical measurements inside cells has led to many important advances in electrophysiology. The patch clamp technique, in which a glass micropipette filled with electrolyte is inserted into a cell, offers both high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution. Ideally, the micropipette should be as small as possible to increase the spatial resolution and reduce the invasiveness of the measurement, but the overall performance of the technique depends on the impedance of the interface between the micropipette and the cell interior, which limits how small the micropipette can be. Techniques that involve inserting metal or carbon microelectrodes into cells are subject to similar constraints. Field-effect transistors (FETs) can also record electric potentials inside cells, and because their performance does not depend on impedance, they can be made much smaller than micropipettes and microelectrodes. Moreover, FET arrays are better suited for multiplexed measurements. Previously, we have demonstrated FET-based intracellular recording with kinked nanowire structures, but the kink configuration and device design places limits on the probe size and the potential for multiplexing. Here, we report a new approach in which a SiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube is synthetically integrated on top of a nanoscale FET. This nanotube penetrates the cell membrane, bringing the cell cytosol into contact with the FET, which is then able to record the intracellular transmembrane potential. Simulations show that the bandwidth of this branched intracellular nanotube FET (BIT-FET) is high enough for it to record fast action potentials even when the nanotube diameter is decreased to 3&#160;nm, a length scale well below that accessible with other methods. Studies of cardiomyocyte cells demonstrate that when phospholipid-modified BIT-FETs are brought close to cells, the nanotubes can spontaneously penetrate the cell membrane to allow the full-amplitude intracellular action potential to be recorded, thus showing that a stable and tight seal forms between the nanotube and cell membrane. We also show that multiple BIT-FETs can record multiplexed intracellular signals from both single cells and networks of cells.</p>",<p>在细胞内进行电测量的能力导致了电生理学的许多重要进步。膜片钳技术，其中将充满电解质的玻璃微量移液器插入电池中，既提供了高信噪比又具有时间分辨率。理想情况下，微量移液器应尽可能小，以提高空间分辨率并降低测量的侵入性，但该技术的整体性能取决于微量移液器与细胞内部之间的界面阻抗，从而限制了微量移液器的体积。微量移液器即可。涉及将金属或碳微电极插入电池的技术也受到类似的限制。场效应晶体管（FET）还可记录电池内部的电势，并且由于其性能不取决于阻抗，因此可以使其比微型移液器和微型电极小得多。此外，FET阵列更适合于多路复用测量。以前，我们已经证明了具有纠结的纳米线结构的基于FET的细胞内记录，但是扭结配置和设备设计对探针尺寸和多路复用潜力提出了限制。在这里，我们报告了一种新方法，其中将SiO <sub> 2 </ sub>纳米管合成集成在纳米级FET的顶部。该纳米管穿透细胞膜，使细胞溶质与FET接触，然后FET能够记录细胞内跨膜电位。仿真表明，即使当纳米管直径减小到3纳米时，这种支化细胞内纳米管FET（BIT-FET）的带宽也足以记录快速动作电位，其长度尺度远低于其他方法可达到的长度。心肌细胞的研究表明，当磷脂修饰的BIT-FETs靠近细胞时，纳米管可以自发穿透细胞膜，从而记录下全幅度的细胞内动作电位，从而表明在细胞之间形成稳定而紧密的密封纳米管和细胞膜。我们还表明，多个BIT-FET可以记录来自单个细胞和细胞网络的多重细胞内信号。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.249,Vertical nanowire electrode arrays as a scalable platform for intracellular interfacing to neuronal circuits,垂直纳米线电极阵列作为细胞内连接神经元回路的可扩展平台 ,"<p>Deciphering the neuronal code&#8212;the rules by which neuronal circuits store and process information&#8212;is a major scientific challenge. Currently, these efforts are impeded by a lack of experimental tools that are sensitive enough to quantify the strength of individual synaptic connections and also scalable enough to simultaneously measure and control a large number of mammalian neurons with single-cell resolution. Here, we report a scalable intracellular electrode platform based on vertical nanowires that allows parallel electrical interfacing to multiple mammalian neurons. Specifically, we show that our vertical nanowire electrode arrays can intracellularly record and stimulate neuronal activity in dissociated cultures of rat cortical neurons and can also be used to map multiple individual synaptic connections. The scalability of this platform, combined with its compatibility with silicon nanofabrication techniques, provides a clear path towards simultaneous, high-fidelity interfacing with hundreds of individual neurons.</p>",<p>破译神经元代码＆＃8212;神经元回路存储和处理信息的规则是一项重大的科学挑战。当前，这些努力受到缺乏足够灵敏地量化单个突触连接强度并且还具有足够的可伸缩性以同时以单细胞分辨率同时测量和控制大量哺乳动物神经元的实验工具的阻碍。在这里，我们报告基于垂直纳米线的可扩展的细胞内电极平台，该平台允许与多个哺乳动物神经元进行并行电连接。具体而言，我们表明，我们的垂直纳米线电极阵列可以在大鼠皮质神经元的分离培养物中胞内记录和刺激神经元活动，也可以用于映射多个单独的突触连接。该平台的可扩展性，以及与硅纳米制造技术的兼容性，为通向数百个单个神经元的同时，高保真接口提供了一条清晰的路径。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.8,Intracellular recording of action potentials by nanopillar electroporation,纳米柱电穿孔在细胞内记录动作电位 ,"<p>Action potentials have a central role in the nervous system and in many cellular processes, notably those involving ion channels. The accurate measurement of action potentials requires efficient coupling between the cell membrane and the measuring electrodes. Intracellular recording methods such as patch clamping involve measuring the voltage or current across the cell membrane by accessing the cell interior with an electrode, allowing both the amplitude and shape of the action potentials to be recorded faithfully with high signal-to-noise ratios. However, the invasive nature of intracellular methods usually limits the recording time to a few hours, and their complexity makes it difficult to simultaneously record more than a few cells. Extracellular recording methods, such as multielectrode arrays and multitransistor arrays, are non-invasive and allow long-term and multiplexed measurements. However, extracellular recording sacrifices the one-to-one correspondence between the cells and electrodes, and also suffers from significantly reduced signal strength and quality. Extracellular techniques are not, therefore, able to record action potentials with the accuracy needed to explore the properties of ion channels. As a result, the pharmacological screening of ion-channel drugs is usually performed by low-throughput intracellular recording methods. The use of nanowire transistors, nanotube-coupled transistors and micro gold-spine and related electrodes can significantly improve the signal strength of recorded action potentials. Here, we show that vertical nanopillar electrodes can record both the extracellular and intracellular action potentials of cultured cardiomyocytes over a long period of time with excellent signal strength and quality. Moreover, it is possible to repeatedly switch between extracellular and intracellular recording by nanoscale electroporation and resealing processes. Furthermore, vertical nanopillar electrodes can detect subtle changes in action potentials induced by drugs that target ion channels.</p>",<p>动作电位在神经系统和许多细胞过程中起着中心作用，特别是那些涉及离子通道的过程。动作电位的准确测量需要细胞膜和测量电极之间的有效耦合。诸如膜片钳之类的细胞内记录方法涉及通过用电极进入细胞内部来测量跨细胞膜的电压或电流，从而允许以高信噪比如实地记录动作电位的幅度和形状。然而，细胞内方法的侵入性通常将记录时间限制为几个小时，并且它们的复杂性使得难以同时记录多个细胞。细胞外记录方法，例如多电极阵列和多晶体管阵列，是非侵入性的，可以进行长期和多路复用的测量。然而，细胞外记录牺牲了细胞和电极之间的一对一对应，并且还遭受信号强度和质量显着降低的困扰。因此，细胞外技术无法以探索离子通道特性所需的精度记录动作电位。结果，离子通道药物的药理筛选通常通过低通量细胞内记录方法进行。纳米线晶体管，纳米管耦合晶体管以及微金脊柱和相关电极的使用可以显着提高记录的动作电位的信号强度。在这里，我们显示出垂直的纳米柱状电极可以长时间记录培养的心肌细胞的细胞外和细胞内动作电位，并具有出色的信号强度和质量。而且，可以通过纳米级电穿孔和重新密封过程在细胞外和细胞内记录之间反复切换。此外，垂直的纳米柱状电极可以检测靶向离子通道的药物引起的动作电位的细微变化。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2011.226,Nanowire-based single-cell endoscopy,基于纳米线的单细胞内窥镜检查 ,"<p>One-dimensional smart probes based on nanowires and nanotubes that can safely penetrate the plasma membrane and enter biological cells are potentially useful in high-resolution and high-throughput gene and drug delivery, biosensing and single-cell electrophysiology. However, using such probes for optical communication across the cellular membrane at the subwavelength level remains limited. Here, we show that a nanowire waveguide attached to the tapered tip of an optical fibre can guide visible light into intracellular compartments of a living mammalian cell, and can also detect optical signals from subcellular regions with high spatial resolution. Furthermore, we show that through light-activated mechanisms the endoscope can deliver payloads into cells with spatial and temporal specificity. Moreover, insertion of the endoscope into cells and illumination of the guided laser did not induce any significant toxicity in the cells.</p>",<p>基于纳米线和纳米管的一维智能探针可以安全地穿透质膜并进入生物细胞，在高分辨率和高通量基因和药物输送，生物传感和单细胞电生理学中很有用。 然而，使用这种探针在亚波长水平上跨细胞膜进行光通信仍然受到限制。 在这里，我们表明，附着在光纤锥形末端的纳米线波导可以将可见光引导到活的哺乳动物细胞的细胞内隔室内，并且还可以以高空间分辨率检测来自亚细胞区域的光信号。 此外，我们表明，通过光激活机制，内窥镜可以将有效载荷传递到具有时空特异性的细胞中。 而且，将内窥镜插入细胞内并在引导激光的照射下不会对细胞产生任何明显的毒性。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.7,A protein transistor made of an antibody molecule and two gold nanoparticles,由抗体分子和两个金纳米粒子组成的蛋白质晶体管 ,"<p>A major challenge in molecular electronics is to attach electrodes to single molecules in a reproducible manner to make molecular junctions that can be operated as transistors. Several attempts have been made to attach electrodes to proteins, but these devices have been unstable. Here, we show that self-assembly can be used to fabricate, in a highly reproducible manner, molecular junctions in which an antibody molecule (immunoglobulin G) binds to two gold nanoparticles, which in turn are connected to source and drain electrodes. We also demonstrate effective gating of the devices with an applied voltage, and show that the charge transport characteristics of these protein transistors are caused by conformational changes in the antibody. Moreover, by attaching CdSe quantum dots to the antibody, we show that the protein transistor can also be gated by an applied optical field. This approach offers a versatile platform for investigations of single-molecule-based biological functions and might also lead to the large-scale manufacture of integrated bioelectronic circuits.</p>",分子电子学中的主要挑战是将电极以可复制的方式连接到单个分子上，以形成可以用作晶体管的分子结。已经进行了几次尝试将电极连接到蛋白质上，但是这些设备一直不稳定。在这里，我们表明自组装可用于以高度可重复的方式制造分子结合，其中抗体分子（免疫球蛋白G）与两个金纳米粒子结合，而金纳米粒子又与源极和漏极连接。我们还展示了施加电压对设备的有效门控，并表明这些蛋白质晶体管的电荷传输特性是由抗体的构象变化引起的。此外，通过将CdSe量子点连接到抗体，我们表明蛋白质晶体管也可以通过施加的光场进行门控。这种方法为研究基于单分子的生物功能提供了一个通用的平台，也可能导致集成生物电子电路的大规模生产。</ p>
