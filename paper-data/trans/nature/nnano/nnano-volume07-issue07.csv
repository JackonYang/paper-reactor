Amyloid fibrils are naturally occurring protein aggregates that are stable in solution or under highly hydrated conditions, have well-organized supramolecular structures and outstanding strength. Here, we show that graphene and amyloid fibrils can be combined to create a new class of biodegradable composite materials with adaptable properties. This new composite material is inexpensive, highly conductive and can be degraded by enzymes. Furthermore, it can reversibly change shape in response to variations in humidity, and can be used in the design of biosensors for quantifying the activity of enzymes. The properties of the composite can be fine-tuned by changing the graphene-to-amyloid ratio.</p>",石墨烯具有出色的机械和电子性能，但其疏水性在生物学相关应用中是一个缺点。 淀粉样原纤维是天然存在的蛋白质聚集体，其在溶液中或在高度水合的条件下稳定，具有组织良好的超分子结构和出色的强度。 在这里，我们表明，石墨烯和淀粉样蛋白原纤维可以结合在一起，以创建具有适应性的新型生物可降解复合材料。 这种新的复合材料价格便宜，导电性强并且可以被酶降解。 此外，它可以响应湿度的变化而可逆地改变形状，并且可以用于设计用于定量酶活性的生物传感器。 可以通过改变石墨烯与淀粉状蛋白的比例来微调复合材料的性能。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.80,Protein–inorganic hybrid nanoflowers,蛋白质-无机杂种纳米花 ,"<p>Flower-shaped inorganic nanocrystals have been used for applications in catalysis and analytical science, but so far there have been no reports of &#8216;nanoflowers&#8217; made of organic components. Here, we report a method for creating hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic nanoflowers using copper (II) ions as the inorganic component and various proteins as the organic component. The protein molecules form complexes with the copper ions, and these complexes become nucleation sites for primary crystals of copper phosphate. Interaction between the protein and copper ions then leads to the growth of micrometre-sized particles that have nanoscale features and that are shaped like flower petals. When an enzyme is used as the protein component of the hybrid nanoflower, it exhibits enhanced enzymatic activity and stability compared with the free enzyme. This is attributed to the high surface area and confinement of the enzymes in the nanoflowers.</p>",花状的无机纳米晶体已经用于催化和分析科学中，但是到目前为止，还没有关于“纳米花”的报道。 由有机成分制成。 在这里，我们报告了一种使用铜（II）离子作为无机成分和各种蛋白质作为有机成分来创建杂化有机无机纳米花的方法。 蛋白质分子与铜离子形成复合物，这些复合物成为磷酸铜初级晶体的成核位点。 蛋白质和铜离子之间的相互作用随后导致具有纳米级特征且形状像花瓣的微米级颗粒的生长。 当将酶用作杂合纳米花的蛋白质组分时，与游离酶相比，它具有增强的酶活性和稳定性。 这归因于纳米花中的高表面积和酶的限制。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.83,Self-orienting nanocubes for the assembly of plasmonic nanojunctions,自定向纳米立方体，用于组装等离激元纳米结 ,"<p>Plasmonic hot spots are formed when metal surfaces with high curvature are separated by nanoscale gaps and an electromagnetic field is localized within the gaps. These hot spots are responsible for phenomena such as subwavelength focusing, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electromagnetic transparency, and depend on the geometry of the nanojunctions between the metal surfaces. Direct-write techniques such as electron-beam lithography can create complex nanostructures with impressive spatial control but struggle to fabricate gaps on the order of a few nanometres or manufacture arrays of nanojunctions in a scalable manner. Self-assembly methods, in contrast, can be carried out on a massively parallel scale using metal nanoparticle building blocks of specific shape. Here, we show that polymer-grafted metal nanocubes can be self-assembled into arrays of one-dimensional strings that have well-defined interparticle orientations and tunable electromagnetic properties. The nanocubes are assembled within a polymer thin film and we observe unique superstructures derived from edge&#8211;edge or face&#8211;face interactions between the nanocubes. The assembly process is strongly dependent on parameters such as polymer chain length, rigidity or grafting density, and can be predicted by free energy calculations.</p>",当具有高曲率的金属表面被纳米级间隙分开并且电磁场位于间隙内时，就会形成等离子体热点。这些热点负责诸如亚波长聚焦，表面增强拉曼光谱和电磁透明性等现象，并取决于金属表面之间纳米结的几何形状。诸如电子束光刻之类的直接写入技术可以创建具有令人印象深刻的空间控制的复杂纳米结构，但很难制造出几纳米量级的间隙或以可扩展的方式制造纳米结的阵列。相反，自组装方法可以使用特定形状的金属纳米粒子构建块以大规模平行的规模进行。在这里，我们表明，聚合物接枝的金属纳米立方体可以自组装成一维字符串的阵列，这些一维字符串具有明确定义的粒子间方向和可调的电磁特性。纳米立方体组装在聚合物薄膜中，我们观察到了独特的超结构，这些超结构是由纳米立方体之间的边或边或面相互作用产生的。组装过程很大程度上取决于聚合物链长，刚度或接枝密度等参数，并且可以通过自由能计算来预测。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.81,Flexible molecular-scale electronic devices,柔性分子规模电子设备 ,"<p>Flexible materials and devices could be exploited in light-emitting diodes, electronic circuits, memory devices, sensors, displays, solar cells and bioelectronic devices. Nanoscale elements such as thin films, nanowires, nanotubes and nanoparticles can also be incorporated into the active films of mechanically flexible devices. Large-area devices containing extremely thin films of molecular materials represent the ultimate scaling of flexible devices based on organic materials, but the influence of bending and twisting on the electrical and mechanical stability of such devices has never been examined. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of two-terminal electronic devices based on self-assembled monolayers of alkyl or aromatic thiol molecules on flexible substrates. We find that the charge transport characteristics of the devices remain stable under severe bending conditions (radius&#160;&#8804;&#160;1&#160;mm) and a large number of repetitive bending cycles (&#8805;1,000). The devices also remain reliable in various bending configurations, including twisted and helical structures.</p>","<p>柔性材料和设备可用于发光二极管，电子电路，存储设备，传感器，显示器，太阳能电池和生物电子设备。诸如薄膜，纳米线，纳米管和纳米颗粒之类的纳米级元素也可以结合到机械柔性装置的有源膜中。包含极薄分子材料薄膜的大面积器件代表了基于有机材料的柔性器件的最终定标，但是从未研究过弯曲和扭曲对此类器件的电气和机械稳定性的影响。在这里，我们报告了基于柔性基板上烷基或芳香硫醇分子自组装单分子膜的两端电子设备的制造和表征。我们发现，器件的电荷传输特性在严重的弯曲条件（半径1mm）和大量重复的弯曲循环（最大1,000次）下保持稳定。 。该设备还可以在各种弯曲配置（包括扭曲和螺旋结构）中保持可靠。</ p> "
10.1038/nnano.2012.94,Anderson–Mott transition in arrays of a few dopant atoms in a silicon transistor,硅晶体管中一些掺杂原子的阵列中的安德森-莫特跃迁 ,"<p>Dopant atoms are used to control the properties of semiconductors in most electronic devices. Recent advances such as single-ion implantation have allowed the precise positioning of single dopants in semiconductors as well as the fabrication of single-atom transistors, representing steps forward in the realization of quantum circuits. However, the interactions between dopant atoms have only been studied in systems containing large numbers of dopants, so it has not been possible to explore fundamental phenomena such as the Anderson&#8211;Mott transition between conduction by sequential tunnelling through isolated dopant atoms, and conduction through thermally activated impurity Hubbard bands. Here, we observe the Anderson&#8211;Mott transition at low temperatures in silicon transistors containing arrays of two, four or six arsenic dopant atoms that have been deterministically implanted along the channel of the device. The transition is induced by controlling the spacing between dopant atoms. Furthermore, at the critical density between tunnelling and band transport regimes, we are able to change the phase of the electron system from a frozen Wigner-like phase to a Fermi glass by increasing the temperature. Our results open up new approaches for the investigation of coherent transport, band engineering and strongly correlated systems in condensed-matter physics.</p>",<p>掺杂原子用于控制大多数电子设备中半导体的特性。单离子注入等最新进展已使半导体中单掺杂剂的精确定位以及单原子晶体管的制造成为现实，这代表着实现量子电路的进步。但是，仅在包含大量掺杂剂的系统中研究了掺杂剂原子之间的相互作用，因此不可能探索基本现象，例如通过隔离的掺杂剂原子的顺序隧穿与传导之间的安德森＆＃8211; Mott过渡通过热活化杂质哈伯带。在这里，我们观察到低温下在包含两个，四个或六个砷掺杂剂原子阵列的硅晶体管中的安德森·莫特跃迁，该阵列已确定地沿器件的沟道注入。通过控制掺杂剂原子之间的间隔来诱导转变。此外，在隧穿和能带传输制度之间的临界密度下，我们能够通过提高温度来将电子系统的相从冻结的维格纳相转变为费米玻璃。我们的研究结果为凝聚态物理中相干输运，能带工程和强相关系统的研究开辟了新途径。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.99,Measuring the size and charge of single nanoscale objects in solution using an electrostatic fluidic trap,使用静电流体阱测量溶液中单个纳米尺度物体的大小和电荷 ,"<p>Measuring the size and charge of objects suspended in solution, such as dispersions of colloids or macromolecules, is a significant challenge. Measurements based on light scattering are inherently biased to larger entities, such as aggregates in the sample, because the intensity of light scattered by a small object scales as the sixth power of its size. Techniques that rely on the collective migration of species in response to external fields (electric or hydrodynamic, for example) are beset with difficulties including low accuracy and dispersion-limited resolution. Here, we show that the size and charge of single nanoscale objects can be directly measured with high throughput by analysing their thermal motion in an array of electrostatic traps. The approach, which is analogous to Millikan's oil drop experiment, could in future be used to detect molecular binding events with high sensitivity or carry out dynamic single-charge resolved measurements at the solid/liquid interface.</p>",<p>测量悬浮在溶液中的物体（例如胶体或大分子的分散体）的大小和电荷是一项重大挑战。 基于光散射的测量固有地偏向于较大的实体，例如样品中的聚集体，因为被小物体散射的光的强度是其大小的六次方。 依赖于物种对外部电场（例如，电场或流体动力学）的集体迁移的技术面临困难，包括精度低和分散受限的分辨率。 在这里，我们表明可以通过分析静电陷阱阵列中的热运动直接以高通量测量单个纳米级物体的大小和电荷。 该方法类似于Millikan的油滴实验，将来可用于以高灵敏度检测分子结合事件，或在固/液界面进行动态单电荷分辨测量。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.74,A pilot study in non-human primates shows no adverse response to intravenous injection of quantum dots,在非人类灵长类动物中进行的一项初步研究表明，对静脉注射量子点无不良反应 ,"<p>Quantum dots have been used in biomedical research for imaging, diagnostics and sensing purposes. However, concerns over the cytotoxicity of their heavy metal constituents and conflicting results from in vitro and small animal toxicity studies have limited their translation towards clinical applications. Here, we show in a pilot study that rhesus macaques injected with phospholipid micelle-encapsulated CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots do not exhibit evidence of toxicity. Blood and biochemical markers remained within normal ranges following treatment, and histology of major organs after 90&#160;days showed no abnormalities. Our results show that acute toxicity of these quantum dots in vivo can be minimal. However, chemical analysis revealed that most of the initial dose of cadmium remained in the liver, spleen and kidneys after 90&#160;days. This means that the breakdown and clearance of quantum dots is quite slow, suggesting that longer-term studies will be required to determine the ultimate fate of these heavy metals and the impact of their persistence in primates.</p>",<p>量子点已在生物医学研究中用于成像，诊断和传感目的。然而，对重金属成分的细胞毒性的关注以及体外和小型动物毒性研究的相互矛盾的结果，将其转化为临床应用受到限制。在这里，我们在一项初步研究中表明，注射了磷脂胶束封装的CdSe / CdS / ZnS量子点的恒河猴并未显示出毒性证据。治疗后血液和生化指标保持在正常范围内，90天后主要器官的组织学未见异常。我们的结果表明，这些量子点在体内的急性毒性可以降至最低。然而，化学分析表明，90天后，大多数初始剂量的镉仍保留在肝脏，脾脏和肾脏中。这意味着量子点的分解和清除相当缓慢，这表明需要进行更长期的研究以确定这些重金属的最终命运以及它们在灵长类动物中的持久性的影响。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.90,Magnetoferritin nanoparticles for targeting and visualizing tumour tissues,磁铁蛋白纳米颗粒用于靶向和可视化肿瘤组织 ,"<p>Engineered nanoparticles have been used to provide diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic information about the status of disease. Nanoparticles developed for these purposes are typically modified with targeting ligands (such as antibodies, peptides or small molecules) or contrast agents using complicated processes and expensive reagents. Moreover, this approach can lead to an excess of ligands on the nanoparticle surface, and this causes non-specific binding and aggregation of nanoparticles, which decreases detection sensitivity. Here, we show that magnetoferritin nanoparticles (M-HFn) can be used to target and visualize tumour tissues without the use of any targeting ligands or contrast agents. Iron oxide nanoparticles are encapsulated inside a recombinant human heavy-chain ferritin (HFn) protein shell, which binds to tumour cells that overexpress transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). The iron oxide core catalyses the oxidation of peroxidase substrates in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to produce a colour reaction that is used to visualize tumour tissues. We examined 474 clinical specimens from patients with nine types of cancer and verified that these nanoparticles can distinguish cancerous cells from normal cells with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 95%.</p>",工程纳米颗粒已用于提供有关疾病状况的诊断，治疗和预后信息。通常使用复杂的过程和昂贵的试剂将靶向配体（例如抗体，肽或小分子）或造影剂修饰为此目的而开发的纳米颗粒。而且，这种方法会导致纳米颗粒表面上的配体过量，这会导致纳米颗粒的非特异性结合和聚集，从而降低检测灵敏度。在这里，我们表明，磁铁蛋白纳米颗粒（M-HFn）可用于靶向和可视化肿瘤组织，而无需使用任何靶向配体或造影剂。氧化铁纳米颗粒被封装在重组人重链铁蛋白（HFn）蛋白壳内部，该蛋白壳与过表达运铁蛋白受体1（TfR1）的肿瘤细胞结合。铁氧化物核在过氧化氢的存在下催化过氧化物酶底物的氧化，产生显色反应，用于可视化肿瘤组织。我们检查了来自9种癌症患者的474个临床标本，并验证了这些纳米粒子可以区分癌细胞与正常细胞，敏感性为98％，特异性为95％。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.71,Emissive ZnO–graphene quantum dots for white-light-emitting diodes,白色发光二极管的发光ZnO-石墨烯量子点 ,"<p>Hybrid nanostructures combining inorganic materials and graphene are being developed for applications such as fuel cells, batteries, photovoltaics and sensors. However, the absence of a bandgap in graphene has restricted the electrical and optical characteristics of these hybrids, particularly their emissive properties. Here, we use a simple solution method to prepare emissive hybrid quantum dots consisting of a ZnO core wrapped in a shell of single-layer graphene. We then use these quantum dots to make a white-light-emitting diode with a brightness of 798&#160;cd&#160;m<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. The strain introduced by curvature opens an electronic bandgap of 250&#160;meV in the graphene, and two additional blue emission peaks are observed in the luminescent spectrum of the quantum dot. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these additional peaks result from a splitting of the lowest unoccupied orbitals of the graphene into three orbitals with distinct energy levels. White emission is achieved by combining the quantum dots with other emissive materials in a multilayer light-emitting diode.</p>",<p>结合无机材料和石墨烯的混合纳米结构正在开发，用于燃料电池，电池，光伏和传感器等应用。然而，石墨烯中不存在带隙限制了这些杂化物的电学和光学特性，特别是它们的发射性质。在这里，我们使用一种简单的求解方法来制备由包裹在单层石墨烯壳中的ZnO核组成的发射混合量子点。然后，我们使用这些量子点制作亮度为798cd＃160m <sup>＆＃8722; 2 </ sup>的白色发光二极管。由曲率引入的应变在石墨烯中打开了250meV的电子带隙，并且在量子点的发光光谱中观察到两个其他的蓝色发射峰。密度泛函理论计算表明，这些额外的峰是由于将石墨烯的最低未占据轨道分成三个具有不同能级的轨道而产生的。通过将量子点与其他发光材料结合在多层发光二极管中来实现白色发射。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2012.88,Dual-gated bilayer graphene hot-electron bolometer,双层双层石墨烯热电子测辐射热仪 ,"<p>Graphene is an attractive material for use in optical detectors because it absorbs light from mid-infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths with nearly equal strength. Graphene is particularly well suited for bolometers&#8212;devices that detect temperature-induced changes in electrical conductivity caused by the absorption of light&#8212;because its small electron heat capacity and weak electron&#8211;phonon coupling lead to large light-induced changes in electron temperature. Here, we demonstrate a hot-electron bolometer made of bilayer graphene that is dual-gated to create a tunable bandgap and electron-temperature-dependent conductivity. The bolometer exhibits a noise-equivalent power (33&#160;fW&#160;Hz<sup>&#8211;1/2</sup> at 5&#160;K) that is several times lower, and intrinsic speed (&gt;1&#160;GHz at 10&#160;K) three to five orders of magnitude higher than commercial silicon bolometers and superconducting transition-edge sensors at similar temperatures.</p>",<p>石墨烯是用于光学探测器的一种有吸引力的材料，因为它以几乎相等的强度吸收从中红外到紫外波长的光。 石墨烯特别适合用于辐射热计的设备，该设备检测由光吸收引起的温度引起的电导率变化，因为它的电子热容量小且电子弱，声子耦合会导致大的光致变化 电子温度 在这里，我们演示了一种由双层石墨烯制成的热电子辐射热测量计，该热电测辐射热器经双重浇铸以创建可调节的带隙和电子温度相关的电导率。 该辐射热计的噪声等效功率（在5＆＃160; fW＆＃160; Hz <sup>＆＃8211; 1/2 </ sup>）低了几倍，并且固有速度（＆gt; ; 1＆＃160; GHz在10＆＃160; K）比类似温度下的商用硅辐射热计和超导过渡边缘传感器高出三到五个数量级。</ p>
