10.1038/nnano.2015.276,An ultrabright and monochromatic electron point source made of a LaB6 nanowire,由LaB6纳米线制成的超亮单色电子点源 ,"<p>Electron sources in the form of one-dimensional nanotubes and nanowires are an essential tool for investigations in a variety of fields, such as X-ray computed tomography, flexible displays, chemical sensors and electron optics applications. However, field emission instability and the need to work under high-vacuum or high-temperature conditions have imposed stringent requirements that are currently limiting the range of application of electron sources. Here we report the fabrication of a LaB<sub>6</sub> nanowire with only a few La atoms bonded on the tip that emits collimated electrons from a single point with high monochromaticity. The nanostructured tip has a low work function of 2.07&#8197;eV (lower than that of Cs) while remaining chemically inert, two properties usually regarded as mutually exclusive. Installed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) field emission gun, our tip shows a current density gain that is about 1,000 times greater than that achievable with W(310) tips, and no emission decay for tens of hours of operation. Using this new SEM, we acquired very low-noise, high-resolution images together with rapid chemical compositional mapping using a tip operated at room temperature and at 10-times higher residual gas pressure than that required for W tips.</p>","一维纳米管和纳米线形式的电子源是在许多领域进行研究的重要工具，例如X射线计算机断层扫描，柔性显示器，化学传感器和电子光学应用。但是，场发射的不稳定性以及在高真空或高温条件下工作的需要提出了严格的要求，这些要求目前限制了电子源的应用范围。在这里，我们报告了仅在尖端结合了几个La原子的LaB <sub> 6 </ sub>纳米线的制备过程，该原子从具有高单色性的单点发射准直电子。纳米结构的尖端在保持化学惰性的同时具有2.077eV的低功函（低于Cs的功函），这两个属性通常被认为是互斥的。我们的尖端安装在扫描电子显微镜（SEM）场发射枪中，显示出的电流密度增益是W（310）尖端可获得的电流密度增益的约1,000倍，并且在数十小时的运行中没有发射衰减。使用这种新的SEM，我们获得了非常低噪声的高分辨率图像，并使用了在室温下操作且比W尖端所需的残余气压高10倍的残余气压的快速化学成分图。</ p> "
10.1038/nnano.2015.280,Spin-wave-beam driven synchronization of nanocontact spin-torque oscillators,纳米接触自旋转矩振荡器的自旋光束驱动同步 ,"<p>The synchronization of multiple nanocontact spin-torque oscillators (NC-STOs) is mediated by propagating spin waves (SWs). Although it has been shown that the Oersted field generated in the vicinity of the NC can dramatically alter the emission pattern of SWs, its role in the synchronization behaviour of multiple NCs has not been considered so far. Here we investigate the synchronization behaviour in multiple NC-STOs oriented either vertically or horizontally, with respect to the in-plane component of the external field. Synchronization is promoted (impeded) by the Oersted field landscape when the NCs are oriented vertically (horizontally) due to the highly anisotropic SW propagation. Not only is robust synchronization between two oscillators observed for separations larger than 1,000&#8197;nm, but synchronization of up to five oscillators, a new record, has been observed in the vertical array geometry. Furthermore, the synchronization can no longer be considered mutual in nature.</p>","<p>多个纳米接触自旋转矩振荡器（NC-STO）的同步是通过传播自旋波（SW）来实现的。尽管已经表明在NC附近产生的Oersted场会极大地改变SW的发射模式，但到目前为止，尚未考虑其在多个NC的同步行为中的作用。在这里，我们研究相对于外部场的平面内分量在垂直或水平取向的多个NC-STO中的同步行为。当NC由于高度各向异性SW传播而垂直（水平）定向时，Oersted场景观将促进（阻碍）同步。不仅观察到间隔大于1,000纳米的两个振荡器之间的鲁棒同步，而且在垂直阵列几何结构中也观察到多达五个振荡器的同步，这是一个新记录。而且，同步本质上不再被认为是相互的。</ p> "
10.1038/nnano.2015.278,Computing in mammalian cells with nucleic acid strand exchange,通过核酸链交换在哺乳动物细胞中进行计算 ,"<p>DNA strand displacement has been widely used for the design of molecular circuits, motors, and sensors in cell-free settings. Recently, it has been shown that this technology can also operate in biological environments, but capabilities remain limited. Here, we look to adapt strand displacement and exchange reactions to mammalian cells and report DNA circuitry that can directly interact with a native mRNA. We began by optimizing the cellular performance of fluorescent reporters based on four-way strand exchange reactions and identified robust design principles by systematically varying the molecular structure, chemistry and delivery method. Next, we developed and tested AND and OR logic gates based on four-way strand exchange, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-input logic. Finally, we established that functional siRNA could be activated through strand exchange, and used native mRNA as programmable scaffolds for co-localizing gates and visualizing their operation with subcellular resolution.</p>",DNA链置换已被广泛用于无细胞环境中的分子电路，电动机和传感器的设计。最近，已经显示出该技术也可以在生物环境中运行，但是能力仍然有限。在这里，我们寻求使链置换和交换反应适应哺乳动物细胞，并报告可以直接与天然mRNA相互作用的DNA电路。我们首先基于四向链交换反应优化荧光报告基因的细胞性能，并通过系统地改变分子结构，化学和递送方法来确定可靠的设计原则。接下来，我们基于四路链交换开发并测试了AND和OR逻辑门，证明了多输入逻辑的可行性。最终，我们确定了功能性siRNA可以通过链交换来激活，并使用天然mRNA作为可编程支架来共定位门并以亚细胞分辨率可视化其操作。 
10.1038/nnano.2015.292,In situ vaccination with cowpea mosaic virus nanoparticles suppresses metastatic cancer,cow豆花叶病毒纳米颗粒的原位接种可抑制转移性癌症 ,"<p>Nanotechnology has tremendous potential to contribute to cancer immunotherapy. The &#8216;in situ vaccination&#8217; immunotherapy strategy directly manipulates identified tumours to overcome local tumour-mediated immunosuppression and subsequently stimulates systemic antitumour immunity to treat metastases. We show that inhalation of self-assembling virus-like nanoparticles from cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) reduces established B16F10 lung melanoma and simultaneously generates potent systemic antitumour immunity against poorly immunogenic B16F10 in the skin. Full efficacy required Il-12, Ifn-&#947;, adaptive immunity and neutrophils. Inhaled CPMV nanoparticles were rapidly taken up by and activated neutrophils in the tumour microenvironment as an important part of the antitumour immune response. CPMV also exhibited clear treatment efficacy and systemic antitumour immunity in ovarian, colon, and breast tumour models in multiple anatomic locations. CPMV nanoparticles are stable, nontoxic, modifiable with drugs and antigens, and their nanomanufacture is highly scalable. These properties, combined with their inherent immunogenicity and demonstrated efficacy against a poorly immunogenic tumour, make CPMV an attractive and novel immunotherapy against metastatic cancer.</p>",<p>纳米技术具有巨大的潜力来促进癌症免疫治疗。 ＆＃8216;原位疫苗接种＆＃8217;免疫疗法策略直接操纵已识别的肿瘤，以克服局部肿瘤介导的免疫抑制，随后刺激全身抗肿瘤免疫力以治疗转移灶。我们显示，从cow豆花叶病毒（CPMV）吸入自组装病毒样纳米颗粒可减少已建立的B16F10肺部黑色素瘤，并同时针对皮肤中免疫原性差的B16F10产生有效的全身抗肿瘤免疫力。充分的功效需要Il-12，Ifn-＆＃947 ;、适应性免疫和嗜中性粒细胞。吸入的CPMV纳米颗粒在肿瘤微环境中迅速被嗜中性粒细胞吸收并活化，这是抗肿瘤免疫反应的重要组成部分。 CPMV在多个解剖位置的卵巢，结肠和乳腺肿瘤模型中也显示出明确的治疗功效和全身抗肿瘤免疫力。 CPMV纳米颗粒稳定，无毒，可通过药物和抗原修饰，并且其纳米制造具有高度可扩展性。这些特性，再加上其固有的免疫原性，并显示出对免疫原性差的肿瘤的疗效，使CPMV成为对抗转移性癌症的有吸引力且新颖的免疫疗法。</ p>
