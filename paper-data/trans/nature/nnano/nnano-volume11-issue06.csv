10.1038/nnano.2015.343,Intraoperative diagnostics and elimination of residual microtumours with plasmonic nanobubbles,术中诊断和消除带有等离子纳米气泡的残留微瘤 ,"<p>Failure of cancer surgery to intraoperatively detect and eliminate microscopic residual disease (MRD) causes lethal recurrence and metastases, and the removal of important normal tissues causes excessive morbidity. Here, we show that a plasmonic nanobubble (PNB), a non-stationary laser pulse-activated nanoevent, intraoperatively detects and eliminates MRD in the surgical bed. PNBs were generated in vivo in head and neck cancer cells by systemically targeting tumours with gold colloids and locally applying near-infrared, low-energy short laser pulses, and were simultaneously detected with an acoustic probe. In mouse models, between 3 and 30 residual cancer cells and MRD (undetectable with current methods) were non-invasively detected up to 4&#8197;mm deep in the surgical bed within 1&#8197;ms. In resectable MRD, PNB-guided surgery prevented local recurrence and delivered 100% tumour-free survival. In unresectable MRD, PNB nanosurgery improved survival twofold compared with standard surgery. Our results show that PNB-guided surgery and nanosurgery can rapidly and precisely detect and remove MRD in simple intraoperative procedures.</p>",<p>癌症手术未能在手术中检测并消除微观残留病（MRD）导致致命的复发和转移，重要的正常组织的切除导致发病率过高。在这里，我们显示了等离激元纳米气泡（PNB），一种非平稳的激光脉冲激活纳米事件，在术中检测并消除了手术床中的MRD。通过用金胶体全身性靶向肿瘤并局部应用近红外，低能量短激光脉冲，可在头颈部癌细胞体内产生PNB，并同时通过声波探头进行检测。在小鼠模型中，在1毫秒内的手术床深达4毫米深处，无创地检测了3到30个残留癌细胞和MRD（当前方法无法检测到）。在可切除的MRD中，PNB引导的手术可防止局部复发，并实现100％无肿瘤生存。在不可切除的MRD中，PNB纳米手术的生存率是标准手术的两倍。我们的结果表明，PNB引导的外科手术和纳米外科手术可以在简单的术中过程中快速，准确地检测和清除MRD。</ p>

10.1038/nnano.2015.334,A quantum phase switch between a single solid-state spin and a photon,单固态自旋和光子之间的量子相位切换 ,"<p>Interactions between single spins and photons are essential for quantum networks and distributed quantum computation. Achieving spin&#8211;photon interactions in a solid-state device could enable compact chip-integrated quantum circuits operating at gigahertz bandwidths. Many theoretical works have suggested using spins embedded in nanophotonic structures to attain this high-speed interface. These proposals implement a quantum switch where the spin flips the state of the photon and a photon flips the spin state. However, such a switch has not yet been realized using a solid-state spin system. Here, we report an experimental realization of a spin&#8211;photon quantum switch using a single solid-state spin embedded in a nanophotonic cavity. We show that the spin state strongly modulates the polarization of a reflected photon, and a single reflected photon coherently rotates the spin state. These strong spin&#8211;photon interactions open up a promising direction for solid-state implementations of high-speed quantum networks and on-chip quantum information processors using nanophotonic devices.</p>",<p>单自旋和光子之间的相互作用对于量子网络和分布式量子计算至关重要。在固态设备中实现自旋光子相互作用可以使紧凑的芯片集成量子电路能够在千兆赫兹带宽下运行。许多理论工作建议使用嵌入纳米光子结构中的自旋来实现这种高速接口。这些提议实现了一种量子开关，其中自旋使光子的状态翻转，而光子使自旋的状态翻转。但是，尚未使用固态自旋系统实现这种开关。在这里，我们报告了使用嵌入纳米光子腔中的单个固态自旋的自旋光子量子开关的实验实现。我们表明，自旋状态强烈地调节了反射光子的偏振，而单个反射光子相干地旋转了自旋状态。这些强大的自旋光子相互作用为使用纳米光子器件的高速量子网络和芯片上量子信息处理器的固态实现提供了一个有希望的方向。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2016.25,Nanopatterning reconfigurable magnetic landscapes via thermally assisted scanning probe lithography,通过热辅助扫描探针光刻对可重构磁态进行纳米图案化 ,"<p>The search for novel tools to control magnetism at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of new paradigms in optics, electronics and spintronics. So far, the fabrication of magnetic nanostructures has been achieved mainly through irreversible structural or chemical modifications. Here, we propose a new concept for creating reconfigurable magnetic nanopatterns by crafting, at the nanoscale, the magnetic anisotropy landscape of a ferromagnetic layer exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnetic layer. By performing localized field cooling with the hot tip of a scanning probe microscope, magnetic structures, with arbitrarily oriented magnetization and tunable unidirectional anisotropy, are reversibly patterned without modifying the film chemistry and topography. This opens unforeseen possibilities for the development of novel metamaterials with finely tuned magnetic properties, such as reconfigurable magneto-plasmonic and magnonic crystals. In this context, we experimentally demonstrate spatially controlled spin wave excitation and propagation in magnetic structures patterned with the proposed method.</p>",<p>寻找新颖的工具来控制纳米级的磁性对于开发光学，电子和自旋电子学的新范例至关重要。迄今为止，磁性纳米结构的制造主要是通过不可逆的结构或化学修饰实现的。在这里，我们提出了一个新概念，通过在纳米尺度上制作交换耦合到反铁磁层的铁磁层的磁各向异性态势来创建可重构的磁性纳米图案。通过使用扫描探针显微镜的热尖端进行局部场冷却，可逆地构图具有任意取向的磁化和可调节的单向各向异性的磁性结构，而不会改变膜的化学性质和形貌。这为开发具有可微调的磁性的新型超材料（如可重构的磁等离子体晶体和镁磁晶体）开辟了无法预料的可能性。在这种情况下，我们通过实验证明了空间旋转自旋波在磁结构中的激发和传播。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2016.19,Frequency fluctuations in silicon nanoresonators,硅纳米谐振器的频率波动 ,"<p>Frequency stability is key to the performance of nanoresonators. This stability is thought to reach a limit with the resonator's ability to resolve thermally induced vibrations. Although measurements and predictions of resonator stability usually disregard fluctuations in the mechanical frequency response, these fluctuations have recently attracted considerable theoretical interest. However, their existence is very difficult to demonstrate experimentally. Here, through a literature review, we show that all studies of frequency stability report values several orders of magnitude larger than the limit imposed by thermomechanical noise. We studied a monocrystalline silicon nanoresonator at room temperature and found a similar discrepancy. We propose a new method to show that this was due to the presence of frequency fluctuations, of unexpected level. The fluctuations were not due to the instrumentation system, or to any other of the known sources investigated. These results challenge our current understanding of frequency fluctuations and call for a change in practices.</p>",<p>频率稳定性是纳米谐振器性能的关键。人们认为这种稳定性已达到谐振器解决热感应振动能力的极限。尽管谐振器稳定性的测量和预测通常忽略了机械频率响应的波动，但是这些波动最近引起了相当大的理论兴趣。但是，它们的存在很难通过实验证明。在这里，通过文献综述，我们表明所有对频率稳定性的研究报告的值都比热机械噪声所施加的极限大几个数量级。我们在室温下研究了单晶硅纳米谐振器，发现了相似的差异。我们提出了一种新的方法来表明这是由于频率波动的存在所致。波动不是由于仪器系统或调查的任何其他已知来源引起的。这些结果挑战了我们目前对频率波动的理解，并要求改变惯例。</ p> 
10.1038/nnano.2016.1,Physically unclonable cryptographic primitives using self-assembled carbon nanotubes,使用自组装碳纳米管的物理不可克隆的密码基元 ,"<p>Information security underpins many aspects of modern society. However, silicon chips are vulnerable to hazards such as counterfeiting, tampering and information leakage through side-channel attacks (for example, by measuring power consumption, timing or electromagnetic radiation). Single-walled carbon nanotubes are a potential replacement for silicon as the channel material of transistors due to their superb electrical properties and intrinsic ultrathin body, but problems such as limited semiconducting purity and non-ideal assembly still need to be addressed before they can deliver high-performance electronics. Here, we show that by using these inherent imperfections, an unclonable electronic random structure can be constructed at low cost from carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes are self-assembled into patterned HfO<sub>2</sub> trenches using ion-exchange chemistry, and the width of the trench is optimized to maximize the randomness of the nanotube placement. With this approach, two-dimensional (2D) random bit arrays are created that can offer ternary-bit architecture by determining the connection yield and switching type of the nanotube devices. As a result, our cryptographic keys provide a significantly higher level of security than conventional binary-bit architecture with the same key size.</p>",<p>信息安全是现代社会许多方面的基础。但是，硅芯片很容易受到伪造，篡改和通过边信道攻击（例如，通过测量功耗，定时或电磁辐射）造成的信息泄漏等危害。单壁碳纳米管由于其出色的电性能和固有的超薄体，可作为硅作为晶体管的沟道材料的潜在替代品，但是在半导体纯度高和组装不理想之前，仍需要解决诸如此类的问题高性能电子产品。在这里，我们表明，通过使用这些固有的缺陷，可以低成本从碳纳米管构建不可克隆的电子无规结构。使用离子交换化学方法将纳米管自组装成图案化的HfO <sub> 2 </ sub>沟槽，并优化沟槽的宽度以最大化纳米管放置的随机性。通过这种方法，可以创建二维（2D）随机位阵列，该阵列可以通过确定纳米管器件的连接良率和开关类型来提供三元位架构。结果，我们的加密密钥比具有相同密钥大小的传统二进制位体系结构提供了更高的安全级别。</ p>

However, the low density of electrochemically active defects in graphene synthesized by chemical vapour deposition limits its application in biosensing. Here, we show that graphene doped with gold and combined with a gold mesh has improved electrochemical activity over bare graphene, sufficient to form a wearable patch for sweat-based diabetes monitoring and feedback therapy. The stretchable device features a serpentine bilayer of gold mesh and gold-doped graphene that forms an efficient electrochemical interface for the stable transfer of electrical signals. The patch consists of a heater, temperature, humidity, glucose and pH sensors and polymeric microneedles that can be thermally activated to deliver drugs transcutaneously. We show that the patch can be thermally actuated to deliver Metformin and reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic mice.</p>",<p>由于其高的载流子迁移率，导电性，柔韧性和光学透明性，石墨烯是微电子和宏观电子中的通用材料。然而，通过化学气相沉积法合成的石墨烯中电化学活性缺陷的低密度限制了其在生物传感中的应用。在这里，我们表明掺杂金并与金网结合的石墨烯比裸石墨烯具有更高的电化学活性，足以形成基于汗液的糖尿病监测和反馈疗法的可穿戴贴剂。可拉伸装置具有金网和金掺杂石墨烯的蛇形双层，可形成有效的电化学界面，以稳定地传输电信号。贴片由加热器，温度，湿度，葡萄糖和pH传感器以及聚合的微针组成，这些针可以热激活以经皮输送药物。结果表明，该贴剂可被热激活以传递二甲双胍并降低糖尿病小鼠的血糖水平。</ p>
