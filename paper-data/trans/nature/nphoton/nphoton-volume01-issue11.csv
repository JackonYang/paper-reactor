10.1038/nphoton.2007.201,Subpicotesla atomic magnetometry with a microfabricated vapour cell,具有微型蒸汽电池的Subpicotesla原子磁力计 ,"<p>Highly sensitive magnetometers capable of measuring magnetic fields below 1&#160;pT have an impact on areas as diverse as geophysical surveying, the detection of unexploded ordinance, space science, nuclear magnetic resonance, health care and perimeter and remote monitoring. Recently, it has been shown that laboratory optical magnetometers, based on the precession of the spins of alkali atoms in the vapour phase, could achieve sensitivities in the femtotesla range, comparable to, or even exceeding, those of superconducting quantum interference devices. We demonstrate here an atomic magnetometer based on a millimetre-scale microfabricated alkali vapour cell with sensitivity below 70&#160;fT&#160;Hz<sup>&#8722;1/2</sup>. Additionally, we use a simplified optical configuration that requires only a single low-power laser. This result suggests that millimetre-scale, low-power femtotesla magnetometers are feasible, and we support this proposition with a simple sensitivity scaling analysis. Such an instrument would greatly expand the range of applications in which atomic magnetometers could be used.</p>",<p>能够测量1 p＃以下磁场的高灵敏磁力计对诸如地球物理勘测，未爆炸物检测，空间科学，核磁共振，医疗保健和周边以及远程监测等领域产生影响。近来，已经显示出基于在气相中碱原子自旋的进动的实验室光学磁力计可以在毫微微特斯拉范围内获得灵敏度，该灵敏度与超导量子干涉装置的灵敏度相当甚至更高。我们在此演示了一种基于原子级微细加工碱式蒸汽电池的原子磁力计，其灵敏度低于70＆＃160; fT＆＃160; Hz <sup>＆＃8722; 1/2 </ sup>。此外，我们使用简化的光学配置，仅需要一个低功率激光器。该结果表明，毫米级，低功率飞秒磁力计是可行的，并且我们通过简单的灵敏度缩放分析来支持这一主张。这种仪器将极大地扩展原子磁强计的应用范围。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2007.202,Light trapping in gravity-like potentials and expansion of supercontinuum spectra in photonic-crystal fibres,重力势能中的光捕获和光子晶体光纤中超连续谱的扩展 ,"<p>Femtosecond pulses of light propagating along photonic-crystal fibres can generate a broad optical supercontinuum. This striking discovery has applications ranging from spectroscopy and metrology to telecommunication and medicine. Among the physical principles underlying supercontinuum generation are soliton emission, a variety of four-wave mixing processes, Raman-induced soliton self-frequency shift, and dispersive wave generation mediated by solitons. Although all of the above effects contribute to supercontinuum generation, none of them can explain the generation of blue and violet light from infrared femtosecond pump pulses. In this work we argue that the most profound role in the shaping of the short-wavelength edge of the continuum is played by the effect of radiation trapping in a gravity-like potential created by accelerating solitons. The underlying physics of this effect has a straightforward analogy with the inertial forces acting on an observer moving with a constant acceleration.</p>",飞秒沿光子晶体光纤传播的光可以产生宽的光学超连续谱。这一惊人发现的应用范围从光谱学和计量学到电信和医学。超连续谱产生的物理原理包括孤子发射，各种四波混合过程，拉曼引起的孤子自频移以及孤子介导的色散波产生。尽管上述所有影响都有助于产生超连续谱，但它们都不能解释红外飞秒泵浦脉冲产生的蓝光和紫光。在这项工作中，我们认为，在连续体短波长边缘的成形中，最深远的作用是由加速孤子所产生的引力状势中的俘获辐射所起的作用。这种效应的基本物理原理与惯性力直接作用于观察者并以恒定加速度运动类似。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2007.203,"Trapping, corralling and spectral bonding of optical resonances through optically induced potentials",通过光感应电势对光共振的陷波，结合和光谱键合 ,"<p>Optical forces resulting from interacting modes and cavities can scale to remarkably large values as the optical modes shrink to nanometre dimensions. Such forces can be harnessed in fundamentally new ways when optical elements can freely adapt to them. Here, we propose the use of optomechanically coupled resonators as a general means of tailoring optomechanical potentials through the action of optical forces. We show that significant attractive and repulsive forces arising from optomechanically coupled cavity resonances can give rise to strong and highly localized optomechanical potential wells whose widths can approach picometre scales. These potentials enable unique all-optical self-adaptive behaviours, such as the trapping and corralling (or dynamic capture) of microcavity resonances with light. It is shown, for example, that a resonator can be designed to dynamically self-align (or spectrally bond) its resonance to an incident laser line. Although these concepts are illustrated through dual-microring cavity designs, broad extension to other photonic topologies can be made.</p>",随着光学模式缩小到纳米尺寸，由相互作用的模式和腔产生的光学力可以缩放到非常大的值。当光学元件可以自由地适应它们时，可以以根本上新的方式利用这种力。在这里，我们建议使用光机耦合谐振器作为通过光力的作用来调整光机势的一般手段。我们表明，由光机耦合腔共振产生的巨大吸引力和排斥力会引起宽度高度可以达到皮米级的强而高度局部化的光机势阱。这些潜力使独特的全光学自适应行为成为可能，例如微腔共振与光的捕获和协同作用（或动态捕获）。例如，示出了可以将谐振器设计为将其谐振动态地自动对准（或频谱结合）到入射激光线。尽管通过双微环腔设计可以说明这些概念，但可以将其扩展到其他光子拓扑。</ p>
