10.1038/nphoton.2008.227,Fast physical random bit generation with chaotic semiconductor lasers,利用混沌半导体激光器快速生成物理随机位 ,"<p>Random number generators in digital information systems make use of physical entropy sources such as electronic and photonic noise to add unpredictability to deterministically generated pseudo-random sequences. However, there is a large gap between the generation rates achieved with existing physical sources and the high data rates of many computation and communication systems; this is a fundamental weakness of these systems. Here we show that good quality random bit sequences can be generated at very fast bit rates using physical chaos in semiconductor lasers. Streams of bits that pass standard statistical tests for randomness have been generated at rates of up to 1.7&#160;Gbps by sampling the fluctuating optical output of two chaotic lasers. This rate is an order of magnitude faster than that of previously reported devices for physical random bit generators with verified randomness. This means that the performance of random number generators can be greatly improved by using chaotic laser devices as physical entropy sources.</p>",<p>数字信息系统中的随机数生成器利用诸如电子和光子噪声之类的物理熵源，为确定性生成的伪随机序列增加了不可预测性。但是，现有物理源的发电率与许多计算和通信系统的高数据率之间存在很大差距。这是这些系统的根本弱点。在这里，我们证明了使用半导体激光器中的物理混乱可以以非常快的比特率生成高质量的随机比特序列。通过对两个混沌激光器的波动光学输出进行采样，可以通过标准的统计测试以进行随机性测试，生成的比特流的速率高达1.7＆＃160; Gbps。该速率比先前报道的具有经验证的随机性的物理随机位发生器的设备快一个数量级。这意味着通过将混沌激光设备用作物理熵源，可以大大提高随机数发生器的性能。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2008.225,Drift-free femtosecond timing synchronization of remote optical and microwave sources,远程光学和微波源的无漂移飞秒定时同步 ,"<p>Femtosecond mode-locked lasers have revolutionized many fields of science and engineering. Because of their ultralow noise, it has been anticipated that mode-locked lasers would synchronize large-scale scientific facilities requiring extremely high timing accuracy. However, the lack of long-term stable synchronization techniques has hindered the realization of pervasive synchronization with such lasers. Here we present a comprehensive set of new techniques for long-term stable synchronization of optical and microwave sources over long distances. We use ultralow-noise optical pulse trains generated from mode-locked lasers as the timing signals, then distribute them by means of timing-stabilized fibre links and, finally, synchronize the delivered timing signals with the optical and microwave sources being targeted. Using these techniques, we demonstrate, for the first time, that remotely located lasers and microwave sources can be synchronized with less than 10-fs precision over more than 10&#160;h. This drift-free operation is an important milestone in transitioning mode-locked laser-based synchronization from the laboratory into real-world facilities.</p>",飞秒锁模激光器彻底改变了科学和工程学的许多领域。由于它们的超低噪声，已经预料到，锁模激光器将使需要极高定时精度的大规模科学设备同步。然而，缺乏长期稳定的同步技术已经阻碍了用这种激光器实现普遍同步。在这里，我们提出了一套全面的新技术，可以使长距离的光和微波源长期稳定同步。我们使用锁模激光器产生的超低噪声光脉冲序列作为定时信号，然后通过定时稳定的光纤链路分配它们，最后，将所传递的定时信号与目标光和微波源进行同步。使用这些技术，我们首次证明了位于远处的激光和微波源在超过10h的时间内可以以不到10fs的精度进行同步。这种无漂移的操作是将锁模激光同步从实验室转变为现实设备的重要里程碑。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2008.228,Low-power continuous-wave nonlinear optics in doped silica glass integrated waveguide structures,掺杂石英玻璃集成波导结构中的低功率连续波非线性光学 ,"<p>Photonic integrated circuits are a key component of future telecommunication networks, where demands for greater bandwidth, network flexibility, and low energy consumption and cost must all be met. The quest for all-optical components has naturally targeted materials with extremely large nonlinearity, including chalcogenide glasses and semiconductors, such as silicon and AlGaAs (ref.&#160;). However, issues such as immature fabrication technology for chalcogenide glass and high linear and nonlinear losses for semiconductors motivate the search for other materials. Here we present the first demonstration of nonlinear optics in integrated silica-based glass waveguides using continuous-wave light. We demonstrate four-wave mixing, with low (5&#160;mW) continuous-wave pump power at &#955;&#160;=&#160;1,550&#160;nm, in high-index, doped silica glass ring resonators. The low loss, design flexibility and manufacturability of our device are important attributes for low-cost, high-performance, nonlinear all-optical photonic integrated circuits.</p>",<p>光子集成电路是未来电信网络的关键组成部分，在该网络中，必须同时满足对更大带宽，网络灵活性以及低能耗和低成本的需求。对全光学组件的追求具有天然目标的材料，这些材料具有非常大的非线性，包括硫族化物玻璃和半导体，例如硅和AlGaAs（参考＆＃160;）。但是，诸如硫族化物玻璃的不成熟制造技术以及半导体的高线性和非线性损耗等问题促使人们寻求其他材料。在这里，我们展示了使用连续波光在集成石英玻璃波导中非线性光学的首次演示。我们演示了在高折射率掺杂石英玻璃中以低波长（5＆＃160; mW）连续波泵浦功率为＆＃955; == 16050 nm的四波混合环形谐振器。我们器件的低损耗，设计灵活性和可制造性是低成本，高性能，非线性全光子光子集成电路的重要属性。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2008.226,Large-scale arrays of ultrahigh-Q coupled nanocavities,超高Q耦合纳米腔的大规模阵列 ,"<p>Coupled microresonators are expected to play a key role in slow-light engineering and various types of light-matter interaction enhancement, especially if they are based on small and high-Q cavities. Although rapid progress has been made on microresonator performance, large-scale arrays of coupled resonators based on high-Q wavelength-sized cavities have not yet been realized. Here, we show large-scale (N&#160;&gt;&#160;100) ultrahigh-Q coupled nanocavity arrays based on photonic crystals. This is the first demonstration of large-scale coupled resonator arrays based on wavelength-sized cavities, in which tight-binding sinusoidal dispersion is seen. We confirm that an ultrahigh value of Q (&#8764;1 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup>) is maintained, even when N is large, and the resonators exhibit very low loss characteristics with regard to light propagation. The ultrahigh value of Q and small size has enabled us to achieve ultraslow light pulse propagation with a group velocity well below 0.01c and a long group delay.</p>",<p>耦合微谐振器有望在慢光工程和各种类型的光-物质相互作用增强中发挥关键作用，特别是如果它们基于小型和高Q腔。尽管在微谐振器性能方面已经取得了迅速的进步，但尚未实现基于高Q波长尺寸腔的耦合谐振器的大规模阵列。在这里，我们展示了基于光子晶体的大规模（N＆＃160;＆＃160; 100）超高Q耦合纳米腔阵列。这是基于波长大小的腔的大规模耦合谐振器阵列的首次演示，其中可以看到紧密结合的正弦波色散。我们确认，即使N很大，也可以保持Q（＆＃8764; 1＆＃215; 10 <sup> 6 </ sup>）的超高值，并且谐振器在光传播方面表现出非常低的损耗特性。 Q的超高值和小尺寸使我们能够以低于0.01c的群速度和长的群延迟实现超慢的光脉冲传播。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2008.229,Geometrodynamics of spinning light,旋转光的地球动力学 ,"<p>The semiclassical evolution of spinning particles has recently been re-examined in condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and optics, resulting in the prediction of the intrinsic spin Hall effect associated with the Berry phase. A fundamental origin of this effect is related to the spin&#8211;orbit interaction and topological monopoles. Here, we report a unified theory and a direct observation of two mutual phenomena: a spin-dependent deflection (the spin Hall effect) of photons and the precession of the Stokes vector along the coiled ray trajectory of classical geometrical optics. Our measurements are in perfect agreement with theoretical predictions, thereby verifying the dynamical action of the topological Berry-phase monopole in the evolution of light. These results may have promising applications in nano-optics and can be immediately extrapolated to the evolution of massless particles in a variety of physical systems.</p>",<p>最近，在凝聚态物理，高能物理和光学领域对纺丝粒子的半经典演化进行了重新检验，从而预测了与贝里相有关的固有自旋霍尔效应。 这种影响的根本原因与自旋轨道相互作用和拓扑单极子有关。 在这里，我们报告一个统一的理论，并直接观察到两个共同的现象：光子的自旋相关偏转（自旋霍尔效应）和斯托克斯矢量沿着经典几何光学的盘旋轨迹的进动。 我们的测量与理论预测完全吻合，从而验证了拓扑Berry相单极子在光演化中的动力学作用。 这些结果可能在纳米光学中具有广阔的应用前景，并且可以立即推断出各种物理系统中无质量粒子的演化。</ p>
