10.1038/nphoton.2009.269,Laser cooling of solids to cryogenic temperatures,激光冷却固体至低温 ,"<p>Laser radiation has been used to cool matter ranging from dilute gases to micromechanical oscillators. In Doppler cooling of gases, the translational energy of atoms is lowered through interaction with a laser field. Recently, cooling of a high-density gas through collisional redistribution of radiation has been demonstrated. In laser cooling of solids, heat is removed through the annihilation of lattice vibrations in the process of anti-Stokes fluorescence. Since its initial observation in 1995, research has led to achieving a temperature of 208&#160;K in ytterbium-doped glass. In this Letter, we report laser cooling of ytterbium-doped LiYF<sub>4</sub> crystal to a temperature of &#8764;155 K starting from ambient, with a cooling power of 90 mW. This is achieved by making use of the Stark manifold resonance in a crystalline host, and demonstrates the lowest temperature achieved to date without the use of cryogens or mechanical refrigeration. Optical refrigeration has entered the cryogenic regime, surpassing the performance of multi-stage Peltier coolers.</p>",激光辐射已被用于冷却从稀薄气体到微机械振荡器的物质。在气体的多普勒冷却中，原子的平移能通过与激光场的相互作用而降低。最近，已经证明了通过辐射的碰撞重新分布来冷却高密度气体。在固体的激光冷却中，在反斯托克斯荧光的过程中，通过消除晶格振动来消除热量。自1995年进行初步观察以来，研究已使掺tter玻璃的温度达到208 K＃。在这封信中，我们报告了从环境温度开始，将掺ped的LiYF <sub> 4 </ sub>晶体从环境温度开始激光冷却至＆＃8764; 155 K的温度，冷却功率为90 mW。这是通过在晶体主体中利用Stark流形共振实现的，并且证明了迄今为止所达到的最低温度，而没有使用冷冻剂或机械制冷。光学制冷已进入低温状态，超越了多级珀耳帖制冷机的性能。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2009.285,Quasi-periodic distributed feedback laser,准周期分布反馈激光器 ,"<p>Although lasers have found numerous applications, their design is often still based on the concept of a gain medium within a mirror cavity. Exceptions to this are distributed feedback lasers, in which feedback develops along a periodic structure, or random lasers, which do not require any form of cavity. Random lasers have very rich emission spectra, but are difficult to control. Distributed feedback devices, conversely, have the same limited design possibilities of regular lasers. We show, by making use of a quasi-crystalline structure in an electrically pumped device, that several advantages of a random laser can be combined with the predictability of a distributed feedback resonator. We have constructed a terahertz quantum cascade laser based on a Fibonacci distributed feedback sequence, and show that engineering of the self-similar spectrum of the grating allows features beyond those possible with traditional periodic resonators, such as directional output independent of the emission frequency and multicolour operation.</p>",<p>尽管激光器已经得到了广泛的应用，但是它们的设计通常仍然基于镜腔内增益介质的概念。分布式反馈激光器（其中的反馈沿周期性结构发展）或随机激光器（不需要任何形式的腔）是一个例外。随机激光器具有非常丰富的发射光谱，但是很难控制。相反，分布式反馈设备具有与普通激光器相同的有限设计可能性。我们表明，通过在电泵设备中使用准晶体结构，可以将随机激光器的几个优点与分布式反馈谐振器的可预测性相结合。我们基于斐波纳契分布反馈序列构造了太赫兹量子级联激光器，并表明，光栅自相似光谱的工程设计允许具有超越传统周期谐振器可能的特征，例如与发射频率和多色无关的定向输出操作。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2009.286,Ultraviolet enhancement cavity for ultrafast nonlinear optics and high-rate multiphoton entanglement experiments,紫外增强腔，用于超快非线性光学和高速率多光子纠缠实验 ,"<p>Ultrafast, ultraviolet light pulses are a key tool for spectroscopic studies (for example, molecular formation and carrier dynamics in semiconductors) as well as a source for non-classical states of light. The power required for many nonlinear processes makes amplifier systems mandatory, which significantly reduces the available repetition rate and thus often lengthens the experimental acquisition time. Here we adopt techniques recently developed for the infrared regime to design the first enhancement cavity for femtosecond ultraviolet pulses. An average ultraviolet power of more than 7&#160;W at a repetition rate of 81&#160;MHz is now available to pump a nonlinear crystal inside the cavity, applied here to implement a powerful source for high-rate experiments with entangled multiphoton states. The field enhancement enables a new scale of experiments in photonic quantum logic and in nonlinear optics research, for example, to operate optical parametric amplifiers at high repetition rates or to create high-harmonic-frequency combs.</p>",<p>超快的紫外光脉冲是光谱研究（例如，半导体中的分子形成和载流子动力学）的关键工具，也是非经典光态的来源。许多非线性过程所需的功率使放大器系统成为必需，这大大降低了可用的重复率，因此通常会延长实验采集时间。在这里，我们采用最近针对红外技术开发的技术，为飞秒紫外线脉冲设计第一个增强腔。现在可以以高于81W的重复频率获得超过7W的平均紫外线功率，以将非线性晶体泵浦到腔体内，在此处用于为纠缠多光子态的高速率实验提供强大的光源。场增强技术使光子量子逻辑和非线性光学研究领域的实验达到了新的规模，例如，可以以高重复率操作光学参量放大器或创建高谐波频率梳。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2009.287x,A highly efficient single-photon source based on a quantum dot in a photonic nanowire,基于光子纳米线中量子点的高效单光子源 ,"<p>The development of efficient solid-state sources of single photons is a major challenge in the context of quantum communication, optical quantum information processing and metrology. Such a source must enable the implementation of a stable, single-photon emitter, like a colour centre in diamond or a semiconductor quantum dot. Achieving a high extraction efficiency has long been recognized as a major issue, and both classical solutions and cavity quantum electrodynamics effects have been applied. We adopt a different approach, based on an InAs quantum dot embedded in a GaAs photonic nanowire with carefully tailored ends. Under optical pumping, we demonstrate a record source efficiency of 0.72, combined with pure single-photon emission. This non-resonant approach also provides broadband spontaneous emission control, thus offering appealing novel opportunities for the development of single-photon sources based on spectrally broad emitters, wavelength-tunable sources or efficient sources of entangled photon pairs.</p>",<p>在量子通信，光学量子信息处理和计量学的背景下，开发有效的单光子固态源是一项重大挑战。这样的光源必须能够实现稳定的单光子发射器，例如钻石或半导体量子点中的色心。长期以来，实现高提取效率一直是一个主要问题，并且经典解决方案和腔体量子电动力学效应都已得到应用。我们采用另一种方法，基于嵌入GaAs光子纳米线中的InAs量子点，并精心定制末端。在光泵浦下，我们证明了创纪录的0.72的源效率，并结合了纯单光子发射。这种非谐振方法还提供宽带自发发射控制，从而为开发基于光谱宽的发射器，波长可调源或纠缠光子对的有效源的单光子源提供了诱人的新机会。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2010.1,Entanglement distillation from Gaussian input states,高斯输入态的纠缠蒸馏 ,"<p>Entanglement distillation is an essential protocol for long-distance quantum communications, typically for extending the range of quantum key distribution. In the field of continuous variable quantum information processing, quantum as well as classical information is encoded in the light field quadratures, often in the form of Gaussian states. However, distillation from Gaussian input states has not yet been accomplished. It is made difficult by a prominent no-go theorem stating that no Gaussian operation can distill Gaussian states. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, such distillation from Gaussian input states, realized by the implementation of non-Gaussian operations. By subtracting one or two photons, a large gain of entanglement was observed. For two photons, Gaussian-like entanglement was also improved. Other than quantum key distribution, this distilled entanglement can also be used for downstream applications such as high-fidelity quantum teleportation and a loophole-free Bell test.</p>",<p>纠缠蒸馏是用于长距离量子通信的基本协议，通常用于扩展量子密钥分发的范围。在连续可变量子信息处理领域，量子信息和经典信息通常以高斯态的形式编码在光场正交图中。但是，尚未完成从高斯输入状态的蒸馏。一个突出的不行定理很难说明高斯运算不能提取高斯状态，这使它变得困难。在这里，我们首次展示了通过非高斯运算的实现而实现的从高斯输入状态的蒸馏。通过减去一两个光子，可以观察到很大的纠缠增益。对于两个光子，类似高斯的纠缠也得到了改善。除了量子密钥分配之外，这种蒸馏纠缠还可以用于下游应用，例如高保真量子隐形传态和无漏洞的贝尔测试。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2009.268,"An ultra-small, low-power, all-optical flip-flop memory on a silicon chip",硅芯片上的超小型，低功耗，全光触发器存储器 ,"<p>Ultra-small, low-power, all-optical switching and memory elements, such as all-optical flip-flops, as well as photonic integrated circuits of many such elements, are in great demand for all-optical signal buffering, switching and processing. Silicon-on-insulator is considered to be a promising platform to accommodate such photonic circuits in large-scale configurations. Through heterogeneous integration of InP membranes onto silicon-on-insulator, a single microdisk laser with a diameter of 7.5&#160;&#181;m, coupled to a silicon-on-insulator wire waveguide, is demonstrated here as an all-optical flip-flop working in a continuous-wave regime with an electrical power consumption of a few milliwatts, allowing switching in 60&#160;ps with 1.8&#160;fJ optical energy. The total power consumption and the device size are, to the best of our knowledge, the smallest reported to date at telecom wavelengths. This is also the only electrically pumped, all-optical flip-flop on silicon built upon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology.</p>",<p>超小型，低功耗，全光开关和存储元件（例如全光触发器）以及许多此类元件的光子集成电路对全光信号缓冲有很大的需求，切换和处理。绝缘体上硅被认为是在大规模配置中容纳此类光子电路的有前途的平台。通过将InP膜异质集成到绝缘体上硅，在此展示了一个直径为7.5μm的微型磁盘激光器，它耦合到绝缘体上硅导线上，是一种全光学触发器在连续波状态下工作，功耗为几毫瓦，允许以1.8 fJ的光能以60ps的速度切换。就我们所知，总功耗和设备尺寸是迄今为止在电信波长下报告的最小功耗。这也是唯一基于互补金属氧化物半导体技术的硅上电泵浦全光触发器。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2009.290,Aperiodic volume optics,非周期性体积光学 ,"<p>Volumetric integrated optical micro- and nanosystems are becoming the new frontier in photonics. Fine control over the material structure within a volume enables novel physical phenomena and previously unthinkable design freedom for spatial, spectral and temporal functions. For instance, materials have been tailored to control light through the use of metamaterials, disordered media and photonic crystals. Although periodic structures have been thoroughly investigated, volumetric aperiodic structures remain largely unexplored. The design of higher dimensional structures is of interest for controlling the multidimensional coherence function (which describes light fields) through diffraction, refraction, radiation and scattering. This report presents a three-dimensional scattering approach to the design of aperiodic volume optical elements and explores new functionalities making use of the now available three-dimensional degrees of freedom. Aperiodic volume elements that multiplex spatial and spectral information are numerically designed and experimentally demonstrated for the first time, hence expanding the traditional capabilities of volume holography, photonic crystals and diffractive optics.</p>",<p>体积集成光学微米和纳米系统正在成为光子学的新前沿。对体积内材料结构的精细控制可实现新颖的物理现象，并实现空间，光谱和时间功能以前无法想象的设计自由。例如，已经通过使用超材料，无序介质和光子晶体来定制材料以控制光。尽管已经对周期性结构进行了深入研究，但体积非周期性结构仍未得到充分探索。对于通过衍射，折射，辐射和散射控制多维相干函数（描述光场），高维结构的设计非常重要。该报告提出了一种用于非周期性体光学元件设计的三维散射方法，并探索了利用现在可用的三维自由度的新功能。首次通过数值设计和实验证明了将空间和光谱信息多路复用的非周期性体积元，从而扩展了体积全息，光子晶体和衍射光学的传统功能。</ p>
