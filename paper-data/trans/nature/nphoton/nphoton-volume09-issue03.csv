10.1038/nphoton.2015.9,High-performance multiple-donor bulk heterojunction solar cells,高性能多施主体异质结太阳能电池 ,"<p>Broadening the absorption bandwidth of polymer solar cells by incorporating multiple absorber donors into the bulk-heterojunction active layer is an attractive means of resolving the narrow absorption of organic semiconductors. However, this leads to a much more complicated system, and previous efforts have met with only limited success. Here, several dual-donor and multi-donor bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells based on a pool of materials with different absorption ranges and preferred molecular structures were studied. The study shows clearly that compatible polymer donors can coexist harmoniously, but the mixing of incompatible polymers can lead to severe molecular disorder and limit device performance. These results provide guidance for the general use of multiple-donor bulk heterojunctions to overcome the absorption limitation and achieve both high performance and fabrication simplicity for organic solar cells.</p>",通过将多个吸收体供体掺入到体-异质结有源层中来提高聚合物太阳能电池的吸收带宽是解决有机半导体窄吸收的有吸引力的手段。 然而，这导致系统更加复杂，并且先前的努力仅取得了有限的成功。 在这里，研究了几种基于不同吸收范围和优选分子结构的材料池的双供体和多供体体异质结聚合物太阳能电池。 该研究清楚地表明，相容的聚合物供体可以和谐共存，但是不相容的聚合物混合会导致严重的分子紊乱并限制器件性能。 这些结果为多施主体异质结的普遍使用提供了指导，以克服吸收限制并实现有机太阳能电池的高性能和简单制造。</ p> 
10.1038/nphoton.2015.11,Interaction between light and highly confined hypersound in a silicon photonic nanowire,硅光子纳米线中光与高约束超声之间的相互作用 ,"<p>In the past decade there has been a surge in research at the boundary between photonics and phononics. Most efforts have centred on coupling light to motion in a high-quality optical cavity, typically geared towards manipulating the quantum state of a mechanical oscillator. It was recently predicted that the strength of the light&#8211;sound interaction would increase drastically in nanoscale silicon photonic wires. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, such a giant overlap between near-infrared light and gigahertz sound co-localized in a small-core silicon wire. The wire is supported by a tiny pillar to block the path for external phonon leakage, trapping 10&#8197;GHz phonons in an area of less than 0.1&#8197;&#956;m<sup>2</sup>. Because our geometry can also be studied in microcavities, it paves the way for complete fusion between the fields of cavity optomechanics and Brillouin scattering. The results bode well for the realization of optically driven lasers/sasers, isolators and comb generators on a densely integrated silicon chip.</p>",<p>在过去的十年中，光子学和声子学之间的边界研究激增。大多数努力都集中在将光耦合到高质量光学腔中的运动上，该光学腔通常用于操纵机械振荡器的量子态。最近预测，在纳米级硅光子线中，光声相互作用的强度将急剧增加。在这里，我们首次展示了在小芯硅线中共定位的近红外光和千兆赫兹声音之间的巨大重叠。导线由一个微小的支柱支撑，以阻止外部声子泄漏的路径，在小于0.1＆＃8197;＆＃956; m <sup> 2 </ sup>的区域中捕获10＆＃8197; GHz声子。因为我们的几何形状也可以在微腔中研究，所以它为腔光学力学领域和布里渊散射领域之间的完全融合铺平了道路。这一结果对于在密集集成的硅芯片上实现光驱激光器/激光，隔离器和梳状发生器是一个好兆头。</ p>
