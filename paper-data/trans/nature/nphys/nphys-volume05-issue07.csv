10.1038/nphys1276,Individual topological tunnelling events of a quantum field probed through their macroscopic consequences,量子场的单个拓扑隧道事件通过其宏观结果进行探测 ,"<p>Phase slips are topological fluctuations that carry the superconducting order-parameter field between distinct current-carrying states. Owing to these phase slips, superconducting nanowires acquire electrical resistance. In such wires, it is well known that at higher temperatures phase slips occur through the process of thermal barrier-crossing by the order-parameter field. At low temperatures, the general expectation is that phase slips should proceed through quantum tunnelling events, which are known as quantum phase slips. However, resistive measurements have produced evidence both for and against the occurrence of quantum phase slips. Here, we report evidence for the observation of individual quantum phase-slip events in homogeneous ultranarrow wires at high bias currents. We accomplish this through measurements of the distribution of switching currents for which the width exhibits a rather counter-intuitive, monotonic increase with decreasing temperature. Importantly, measurements show that in nanowires with larger critical currents, quantum fluctuations dominate thermal fluctuations up to higher temperatures.</p>",<p>相移是拓扑波动，在不同的载流状态之间携带超导阶数参数场。由于这些相移，超导纳米线获得了电阻。在这样的导线中，众所周知的是，在较高温度下，通过有序参数场的热障穿越过程会发生相移。在低温下，人们普遍期望相移应通过量子隧穿事件进行，这被称为量子相移。然而，电阻测量已经为支持和反对了量子相滑的出现提供了证据。在这里，我们报告了在高偏置电流下均质超细导线中单个量子相位滑移事件的观察证据。我们通过测量开关电流的分布来实现这一点，该开关电流的宽度随着温度的降低而呈现出相当违反直觉的单调增加。重要的是，测量结果表明，在具有更大临界电流的纳米线中，直到更高的温度，量子涨落仍占热涨落。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys1304,Resolved-sideband cooling and position measurement of a micromechanical oscillator close to the Heisenberg uncertainty limit,接近海森堡不确定性极限的微机械振荡器的分辨边带冷却和位置测量 ,"<p>The theory of quantum measurement of mechanical motion, describing the mutual coupling of a meter and a measured object, predicts a variety of phenomena such as quantum backaction, quantum correlations and non-classical states of motion. In spite of great experimental efforts, mostly based on nano-electromechanical systems, probing these in a laboratory setting has as yet eluded researchers. Cavity optomechanical systems, in which a high-quality optical resonator is parametrically coupled to a mechanical oscillator, hold great promise as a route towards the observation of such effects with macroscopic oscillators. Here, we present measurements on optomechanical systems exhibiting radiofrequency (62&#8211;122&#8201;MHz) mechanical modes, cooled to very low occupancy using a combination of cryogenic precooling and resolved-sideband laser cooling. The lowest achieved occupancy is n&#8764;63. Optical measurements of these ultracold oscillators&#8217; motion are shown to perform in a near-ideal manner, exhibiting an imprecision&#8211;backaction product about one order of magnitude lower than the results obtained with nano-electromechanical transducers.</p>",<p>机械运动的量子测量理论描述了仪表和被测物体的相互耦合，预测了多种现象，例如量子反作用，量子相关性和非经典运动状态。尽管进行了大量的实验工作（主要基于纳米机电系统），但在实验室环境下进行探测仍未引起研究人员的注意。腔光学机械系统（其中高质量的光学谐振器参数耦合到机械振荡器）具有广阔的前景，有望成为用宏观振荡器观察这种影响的途径。在这里，我们介绍了对光机械系统的测量结果，这些光机械系统显示出射频（62＆＃8211; 122＆＃8201; MHz）机械模式，并结合了低温预冷和分辨边带激光冷却将其冷却至非常低的占用率。达到的最低占用率是n＆＃8764; 63。这些超冷振荡器的光学测量＆＃8217;所示的运动以近乎理想的方式执行，表现出不精确的反作用积，比使用纳米机电换能器获得的结果低约一个数量级。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys1285,Coherent ultrafast magnetism induced by femtosecond laser pulses,飞秒激光脉冲引起的相干超快磁性 ,"<p>The quest for ultrafast magnetic processes has triggered a new field of research&#8212;femtomagnetism: using femtosecond laser pulses to demagnetize ferromagnetic metallic thin films. Despite being the subject of intense research for over a decade, the underlying mechanisms that govern the demagnetization remain unclear. Here, we investigate how an ultrashort laser pulse couples to the spin of electrons in ferromagnetic metals. It is shown that a single 50-fs laser pulse couples efficiently to a ferromagnetic film during its own propagation. This result indicates that the material polarization induced by the photon field interacts coherently with the spins. The corresponding mechanism has its origin in relativistic quantum electrodynamics, beyond the spin&#8211;orbit interaction involving the ionic potential. In addition, this coherent interaction is clearly distinguished from the incoherent ultrafast demagnetization associated with the thermalization of the spins. We forecast that the corresponding coherent self-induced processes are the dawn of a new era for future research in magnetism.</p>",<p>对超快磁过程的追求引发了飞磁的新研究领域：使用飞秒激光脉冲使铁磁金属薄膜消磁。尽管已经进行了十多年的深入研究，但控制消磁的基本机制仍不清楚。在这里，我们研究了超短激光脉冲如何耦合到铁磁金属中的电子自旋。结果表明，单个50 fs的激光脉冲在其自身传播过程中有效耦合到铁磁膜。该结果表明，由光子场引起的材料极化与自旋相干地相互作用。相应的机制起源于相对论量子电动力学，超越了涉及离子势的自旋轨道相互作用。另外，这种相干相互作用明显不同于与自旋热化相关的非相干超快退磁。我们预测相应的相干自感应过程是磁性研究的新时代的曙光。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys1300,Experimental onset threshold and magnetic pressure pile-up for 3D reconnection,用于3D重新连接的实验起始阈值和电磁压力堆积 ,"<p>Magnetic reconnection changes the topology of magnetic field lines to a lower-energy state. This process can liberate stored magnetic field energy and accelerate particles during unsteady, explosive events. This is one of the most important processes in astrophysical, space and laboratory plasmas. The abrupt onset and cessation has been a long-standing puzzle. We show the first three-dimensional (3D) laboratory example of the onset and stagnation of magnetic reconnection between magnetized and parallel current channels (flux ropes) driven by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) attraction and a 3D plasma-current-driven instability. Antiparallel magnetic field lines carried by these colliding flux ropes annihilate and drive an electric field. The inflow soon exceeds a threshold for the formation of a reconnection current layer. Magnetic flux and pressure pile up just outside this layer, and eventually become large enough to support MHD back-reaction forces that stall the inflow and stagnate the reconnection process.</p>",<p>磁性重新连接将磁场线的拓扑更改为较低能量的状态。在不稳定的爆炸事件中，此过程可以释放存储的磁场能量并加速粒子运动。这是天体，空间和实验室等离子体中最重要的过程之一。突然发作和停止是一个长期的难题。我们展示了第一个三维（3D）实验室示例，该示例由磁流体动力学（MHD）吸引和3D等离子体电流驱动的不稳定性驱动的磁化电流通道和并联电流通道（磁通绳）之间的磁重新连接起止。这些相互碰撞的磁通绳所承载的反平行磁场线会消灭并驱动电场。流入的流量很快超过了重新连接电流层形成的阈值。磁通量和压力堆积在该层的外部，最终变得足够大以支撑MHD的反作用力，从而使流入停滞并阻碍重新连接过程。</ p>
