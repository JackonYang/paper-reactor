In a hydrodynamic picture, quantum systems exhibit analogues of these dynamical features. Here we uncover novel quantum dynamics induced by fast particles by considering impurities injected supersonically into a one-dimensional quantum liquid. We find that the injected particle never comes to a full stop, at odds with conventional expectations of relaxation. Furthermore the system excites a new type of collective mode, manifesting itself in several observable quantities, such as long-lived oscillations in the velocity of the injected particle and simultaneous oscillations of the correlation hole formed around the impurity. These features are inherently quantum-mechanical and provide an example of a dynamically formed quantum coherent state propagating through a many-body environment while maintaining its coherence. The signatures of these effects can be probed directly with existing experimental tools.</p>",<p>介质中的快速障碍物是造成撞击的物理现象的原因，例如空气动力颤动，埃伦科夫辐射和声波。在流体动力学图中，量子系统表现出这些动力学特征的类似物。在这里，我们通过考虑以超声波方式将杂质注入一维量子液体中，揭示了由快速粒子引起的新型量子动力学。我们发现，所注入的粒子永远不会完全停止，这与常规的松弛期望相悖。此外，该系统还激发了一种新型的集体模式，以几种可观察到的量表现出来，例如注入粒子速度的长期振荡以及杂质周围形成的相关孔的同时振荡。这些特征本质上是量子力学的，并提供了在保持其相干性的同时通过多体环境传播的动态形成的量子相干态的示例。这些效应的特征可以使用现有的实验工具直接探测。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys2479,Zero-bias peaks and splitting in an Al–InAs nanowire topological superconductor as a signature of Majorana fermions,Al-InAs纳米线拓扑超导体中的零偏峰和分裂，是马里亚纳费米子的特征 ,"<p>Majorana fermions are the only fermionic particles that are expected to be their own antiparticles. Although elementary particles of the Majorana type have not been identified yet, quasi-particles with Majorana-like properties, born from interacting electrons in the solid, have been predicted to exist. Here, we present thorough experimental studies, backed by numerical simulations, of a system composed of an aluminium superconductor in proximity to an indium arsenide nanowire, with the latter possessing strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting. An induced one-dimensional topological superconductor, supporting Majorana fermions at both ends, is expected to form. We concentrate on the characteristics of a distinct zero-bias conductance peak and its splitting in energy&#8212;both appearing only with a small magnetic field applied along the wire. The zero-bias conductance peak was found to be robustly tied to the Fermi energy over a wide range of system parameters. Although not providing definite proof of a Majorana state, the presented data and the simulations support its existence.</p>",<p>马约拉纳费米子是唯一有望成为其自身反粒子的费米离子粒子。尽管还没有鉴定出马约拉那类型的基本粒子，但是已经预测到存在具有类似马约拉那性质的准粒子，它们是由固体中的相互作用电子所产生的。在这里，我们以数字模拟为基础，对由铝超导体组成的系统进行了全面的实验研究，该系统靠近砷化铟纳米线，后者具有强的自旋-轨道耦合和塞曼分裂。预计会形成感应的一维拓扑超导体，在两端均支撑着马里亚纳费米子。我们专注于一个明显的零偏电导峰的特性及其在能量中的分裂，这两个现象仅在沿着导线施加的小磁场时才出现。发现零偏置电导峰在很宽的系统参数范围内与费米能量牢固相关。尽管没有提供马约拉纳状态的确切证据，但所提供的数据和模拟结果都支持该状态的存在。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys2441,Strong Coulomb drag and broken symmetry in double-layer graphene,双层石墨烯中的强库仑阻力和对称断裂 ,"<p>Coulomb drag is a frictional coupling between electric currents flowing in spatially separated conducting layers. It is caused by interlayer electron&#8211;electron interactions. Previously, only the regime of weak (d&#8811;l) to intermediate (d&#8764;l) coupling could be studied experimentally, where dis the interlayer separation and l is the characteristic distance between charge carriers. Here we use graphene&#8211;boron-nitride heterostructures with d down to 1&#8201;nm to probe Coulomb drag in the limit d&#8810;l such that the two Dirac liquids effectively nest within the same plane, but can still be tuned and measured independently. The strongly interacting regime reveals many unexpected features. In particular, although drag vanishes because of electron&#8211;hole symmetry when either layer is neutral, we often find drag strongest when both layers are neutral. Under this circumstance, drag is positive in zero magnetic field but changes its sign and rapidly grows in strength with field. The drag remains strong at room temperature. The broken electron&#8211;hole symmetry is attributed to mutual polarization of closely spaced interacting layers.</p>",库仑阻力是在空间上分离的导电层中流动的电流之间的摩擦耦合。这是由层间电子相互作用引起的。以前，只能通过实验研究弱耦合（d＆＃8811; l）到中间耦合（d＆＃8764; l）的情况，其中层间间隔为dis，l为载流子之间的特征距离。在这里，我们使用d小于1的石墨烯-氮化硼异质结构探测极限d内的库仑阻力，以使两种狄拉克液体有效地嵌套在同一平面内，但仍可进行调整并独立测量。相互作用强烈的体制揭示了许多意想不到的特征。特别地，尽管当任一层为中性时阻力由于电子空穴对称性而消失，但是当两层均为中性时我们经常发现阻力最强。在这种情况下，阻力在零磁场中为正，但其符号会发生变化，并且强度会随着磁场而快速增长。在室温下，阻力仍然很强。破裂的电子空穴对称性归因于紧密间隔的相互作用层的相互极化。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys2465,Identifying topological order by entanglement entropy,通过纠缠熵识别拓扑顺序 ,"<p>Topological phases are unique states of matter that incorporate long-range quantum entanglement and host exotic excitations with fractional quantum statistics. Here we report a practical method to identify topological phases in arbitrary realistic models by accurately calculating the topological entanglement entropy using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We argue that the DMRG algorithm systematically selects a minimally entangled state from the quasi-degenerate ground states in a topological phase. This tendency explains both the success of our method and the absence of ground-state degeneracy in previous DMRG studies of topological phases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure by obtaining the topological entanglement entropy for several microscopic models, with an accuracy of the order of 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>, when the circumference of the cylinder is around ten times the correlation length. As an example, we definitively show that the ground state of the quantum S = 1/2 antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice is a topological spin liquid, and strongly constrain the conditions for identification of this phase of matter.</p>",<p>拓扑阶段是物质的独特状态，结合了长距离量子纠缠和具有分数量子统计的宿主奇异激发。在这里，我们报告了一种实用的方法，可通过使用密度矩阵重归一化组（DMRG）精确计算拓扑纠缠熵来确定任意现实模型中的拓扑相。我们认为，DMRG算法在拓扑阶段从拟简并基态中系统地选择了最小纠缠态。这种趋势既说明了我们方法的成功，也说明了先前的DMRG拓扑阶段研究中没有基态简并性。我们通过获取几个微观模型的拓扑纠缠熵来证明我们程序的有效性，当圆柱体的周长大约是圆柱体周长的十倍时，精度为10 <sup>＆＃8722; 3 </ sup>。相关长度。作为一个例子，我们确定地证明，在Kagome晶格上的量子S = 1/2反铁磁体的基态是一种拓扑自旋液体，并强烈地限制了识别该相的条件。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys2431,Spin dynamics of molecular nanomagnets unravelled at atomic scale by four-dimensional inelastic neutron scattering,二维非弹性中子散射以原子尺度解开分子纳米磁铁的自旋动力学 ,"<p>Molecular nanomagnets are among the first examples of finite-size spin systems and have been test beds for addressing several phenomena in quantum dynamics. In fact, for short-enough timescales the spin wavefunctions evolve coherently according to an appropriate spin Hamiltonian, which can be engineered to meet specific requirements. Unfortunately, so far it has been impossible to determine these spin dynamics directly. Here we show that recently developed instrumentation yields the four-dimensional inelastic-neutron scattering function in vast portions of reciprocal space and enables the spin dynamics to be determined directly. We use the Cr<sub>8</sub> antiferromagnetic ring as a benchmark to demonstrate the potential of this approach which allows us, for example, to examine how quantum fluctuations propagate along the ring or to test the degree of validity of the N&#233;el-vector-tunnelling framework.</p>",分子纳米磁铁是有限尺寸自旋系统的首批实例之一，并且已经成为解决量子动力学中若干现象的试验台。 实际上，对于足够短的时间尺度，自旋波函数会根据适当的自旋哈密顿量而相干地发展，可以将其设计为满足特定要求。 不幸的是，到目前为止，不可能直接确定这些自旋动力学。 在这里，我们表明，最近开发的仪器可在倒数空间的大部分中产生四维非弹性中子散射函数，并能够直接确定自旋动力学。 我们以Cr <sub> 8 </ sub>反铁磁环为基准来证明这种方法的潜力，例如，它使我们能够检查量子涨落如何沿着环传播或测试N＆的有效性。 ＃233; el-vector-tunnelling框架。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys2463,Hyper-transport of light and stochastic acceleration by evolving disorder,进化障碍导致光的超传输和随机加速 ,"<p>In 1958, Philip Anderson argued that disorder can transform a conductor into an insulator, as multiple scattering from disorder brings transport to a complete halt. This concept, known as Anderson localization, has been tested in electronic, optical, acoustic and matter wave systems, which have all shown that disorder generally works to arrest transport. One major condition is common to all work on Anderson localization: for localization to take place, the underlying potential must be constant in time (frozen). Otherwise, if the disorder is dynamically evolving, localization breaks down and diffusive transport is expected to prevail. However, it seems natural to ask: can disorder increase the transport rate beyond diffusion, possibly even beyond ballistic transport? Here, we use a paraxial optical setting as a model system, and demonstrate experimentally and numerically that an evolving random potential gives rise to stochastic acceleration, which causes an initial wave packet to expand at a rate faster than ballistic, while its transverse momentum spectrum continuously expands. We discuss the universal aspects of the phenomenon relevant for all wave systems containing disorder.</p>",<p> 1958年，菲利普·安德森（Philip Anderson）辩称，无序可以将导体转变为绝缘体，因为无序的多次散射使传输完全停止。这个被称为安德森定位的概念已经在电子，光学，声波和物质波系统中进行了测试，所有这些都表明，无序通常可以阻止运输。所有有关Anderson本地化的工作都有一个主要条件：要进行本地化，潜在的潜力必须在时间上保持恒定（冻结）。否则，如果疾病正在动态发展，则定位会崩溃，并且扩散性运输有望占上风。但是，似乎很自然地会问：无序状态能否增加运输速度而不是扩散，甚至可能超出弹道运输？在这里，我们使用近轴光学设置作为模型系统，并通过实验和数值证明，不断发展的随机势会引起随机加速度，这会导致初始波包以比弹道快的速度扩展，而其横向动量谱则不断扩展。我们讨论了与所有包含无序波系统有关的现象的普遍性。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys2457,Production of spin-controlled rare isotope beams,自旋控制稀有同位素束的产生 ,"<p>The degree of freedom of spin in quantum systems serves as an unparalleled laboratory where intriguing quantum physical properties can be observed, and the ability to control spin is a powerful tool in physics research. We propose a method for controlling spin in a system of rare isotopes which takes advantage of the mechanism of the projectile fragmentation reaction combined with the momentum-dispersion matching technique. The present method was verified in an experiment at the RIKEN RI Beam Factory, in which a degree of alignment of 8% was achieved for the spin of a rare isotope <sup>32</sup>Al. The figure of merit for the present method was found to be greater than that of the conventional method by a factor of more than 50.</p>",<p>量子系统中的自旋自由度是无与伦比的实验室，可以观察到有趣的量子物理特性，并且控制自旋的能力是物理学研究中的强大工具。 我们提出了一种在稀有同位素系统中控制自旋的方法，该方法利用了弹丸碎裂反应的机理并结合了动量-分散匹配技术。 该方法在RIKEN RI Beam Factory的实验中得到验证，其中稀有同位素<sup> 32 </ sup> Al的自旋达到8％的对准度。 发现该方法的品质因数比常规方法的品质因数大50倍以上。</ p> 
10.1038/nphys2440,Super-elastic collision of large-scale magnetized plasmoids in the heliosphere,大范围磁化等离子体的超弹性碰撞 ,"<p>A super-elastic collision is an unusual process in which some mechanism causes the kinetic energy of the system to increase. Most studies have focused on solid-like objects, and have rarely considered gases or liquids, as the collision of these is primarily a mixing process. However, magnetized plasmoids are different from ordinary gases&#8212;as cross-field diffusion is effectively prohibited&#8212;but it remains unclear how they behave during a collision. Here we present a comprehensive picture of a unique collision between two coronal mass ejections in the heliosphere, which are the largest magnetized plasmoids erupting from the Sun. Our analysis reveals that these two magnetized plasmoids collided as if they were solid-like objects, with a likelihood of 73% that the collision was super-elastic. The total kinetic energy of the plasmoid system increased by about 6.6% through the collision, significantly influencing its dynamics.</p>",<p>超弹性碰撞是一个不寻常的过程，其中某些机制导致系统的动能增加。 大多数研究都集中在固体物体上，很少考虑气体或液体，因为它们的碰撞主要是混合过程。 但是，磁化的等离子体与普通气体不同，因为有效地禁止了跨场扩散，但仍不清楚它们在碰撞过程中的行为。 在这里，我们展示了太阳系中两次日冕质量抛射之间唯一碰撞的综合情况，这是从太阳喷出的最大磁化等离子体。 我们的分析表明，这两个磁化的等离子体在碰撞时好像它们是固体一样，有73％的碰撞是超弹性的。 通过碰撞，等离子体系统的总动能增加了约6.6％，大大影响了其动力学。</ p>
