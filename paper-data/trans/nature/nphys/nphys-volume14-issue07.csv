10.1038/s41567-018-0105-0,Amplification of intense light fields by nearly free electrons,几乎自由的电子放大强光场 ,"<p>Light can be used to modify and control properties of media, as in the case of electromagnetically induced transparency or, more recently, for the generation of slow light or bright coherent extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. Particularly unusual states of matter can be created by light fields with strengths comparable to the Coulomb field that binds valence electrons in atoms, leading to nearly free electrons oscillating in the laser field and yet still loosely bound to the core. These are known as Kramers&#8211;Henneberger states, a specific example of laser-dressed states. Here, we demonstrate that these states arise not only in isolated atoms, but also in rare gases, at and above atmospheric pressure, where they can act as a gain medium during laser filamentation. Using shaped laser pulses, gain in these states is achieved within just a few cycles of the guided field. The corresponding lasing emission is a signature of population inversion in these states and of their stability against ionization. Our work demonstrates that these unusual states of neutral atoms can be exploited to create a general ultrafast gain mechanism during laser filamentation.</p>",<p>光可以用于修改和控制介质的属性，例如在电磁感应的透明性的情况下，或者最近可以用于生成慢光或明亮的相干极端紫外线和X射线辐射。具有与库仑场相当的强度的光场可以产生特别不寻常的物质状态，该光场将原子中的价电子束缚在一起，导致几乎自由的电子在激光场中振荡，但仍然松散地束缚在核上。这些被称为Kramers＆＃8211; Henneberger状态，是激光修正状态的特定示例。在这里，我们证明了这些状态不仅出现在大气压及以上的孤立原子中，而且还出现在稀有气体中，它们在激光灯丝化过程中可以作为增益介质。使用整形的激光脉冲，仅在引导场的几个周期内即可获得这些状态下的增益。相应的激光发射是这些状态下种群反转及其抗电离稳定性的标志。我们的工作表明，可以利用这些异常状态的中性原子在激光灯丝化过程中建立通用的超快增益机制。</ p> 
10.1038/s41567-018-0080-5,Ultrafast preparation and detection of ring currents in single atoms,超快速制备和检测单个原子中的环电流 ,"<p>Quantum particles can penetrate potential barriers by tunnelling. If that barrier is rotating, the tunnelling process is modified. This is typical for electrons in atoms, molecules or solids exposed to strong circularly polarized laser pulses. Here we measure how the transmission probability through a rotating tunnel depends on the sign of the magnetic quantum number m of the electron and thus on the initial direction of rotation of its quantum phase. We further show that our findings agree with a semiclassical picture, in which the electron keeps part of that rotary motion on its way through the tunnel by measuring m-dependent modification of the electron emission pattern. These findings are relevant for attosecond metrology as well as for interpretation of strong-field electron emission from atoms and molecules and directly demonstrate the creation of ring currents in bound states of ions with attosecond precision. In solids, this could open a way to inducing and controlling ring-current-related topological phenomena.</p>",<p>量子粒子可以通过隧穿穿透潜在的屏障。如果该障碍物正在旋转，则将修改隧道过程。这对于暴露于强圆偏振激光脉冲的原子，分子或固体中的电子来说是典型的。在这里，我们测量通过旋转隧道的传输概率如何取决于电子的磁性量子数m的符号，从而取决于其量子相旋转的初始方向。我们进一步表明，我们的发现与半经典图像相符，在该图像中，电子通过测量电子发射模式的m依赖修饰来保持部分旋转运动通过隧道。这些发现与阿秒计量学以及从原子和分子的强场电子发射的解释有关，并且直接证明了在原子的束缚态下以阿秒精度产生环电流。在固体中，这可能为诱导和控制环电流相关的拓扑现象开辟一条途径。</ p> 
10.1038/s41567-018-0115-y,On-demand quantum state transfer and entanglement between remote microwave cavity memories,远程微波腔存储器之间的按需量子状态转移和纠缠 ,"<p>Coupling isolated quantum systems through propagating photons is a central theme in quantum science, with the potential for groundbreaking applications such as distributed, fault-tolerant quantum computing. To date, photons have been used widely to realize high-fidelity remote entanglement and state transfer by compensating for inefficiency with conditioning, a fundamentally probabilistic strategy that places limits on the rate of communication. In contrast, here we experimentally realize a long-standing proposal for deterministic, direct quantum state transfer. Using efficient, parametrically controlled emission and absorption of microwave photons, we show on-demand, high-fidelity state transfer and entanglement between two isolated superconducting cavity quantum memories. The transfer rate is faster than the rate of photon loss in either memory, an essential requirement for complex networks. By transferring states in a multiphoton encoding, we further show that the use of cavity memories and state-independent transfer creates the striking opportunity to deterministically mitigate transmission loss with quantum error correction. Our results establish a compelling approach for deterministic quantum communication across networks, and will enable modular scaling of superconducting quantum circuits.</p>",<p>通过传播光子耦合孤立的量子系统是量子科学的中心主题，具有开创性的应用潜力，例如分布式，容错量子计算。迄今为止，光子已通过补偿条件调节的无效性而被广泛用于实现高保真度的远程纠缠和状态转移，调节是一种从根本上限制通信速率的概率策略。相反，这里我们通过实验实现了确定性直接量子状态转移的长期建议。使用有效的，受参数控制的微波光子的发射和吸收，我们显示了两个隔离的超导腔量子存储器之间的按需高保真状态转移和纠缠。传输速率快于任一存储器中的光子丢失速率，这是复杂网络的基本要求。通过在多光子编码中传输状态，我们进一步表明，使用腔存储器和独立于状态的传输为利用量子误差校正确定性地减轻传输损耗创造了惊人的机会。我们的结果为跨网络确定性量子通信建立了一种令人信服的方法，并将能够实现超导量子电路的模块化缩放。</ p> 
10.1038/s41567-018-0116-x,Experimental signatures of emergent quantum electrodynamics in Pr2Hf2O7,Pr2Hf2O7中涌现的量子电动力学的实验特征 ,"<p>In a quantum spin liquid, the magnetic moments of the constituent electron spins evade classical long-range order to form an exotic state that is quantum entangled and coherent over macroscopic length scales. Such phases offer promising perspectives for device applications in quantum information technologies, and their study can reveal new physics in quantum matter. Quantum spin ice is an appealing proposal of one such state, in which the fundamental ground state properties and excitations are described by an emergent U(1) lattice gauge theory. This quantum-coherent regime has quasiparticles that are predicted to behave like magnetic and electric monopoles, along with a gauge boson playing the role of an artificial photon. However, this emergent lattice quantum electrodynamics has proved elusive in experiments. Here we report neutron scattering measurements of the rare-earth pyrochlore magnet Pr<sub>2</sub>Hf<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> that provide evidence for a quantum spin ice ground state. We find a quasi-elastic structure factor with pinch points&#8212;a signature of a classical spin ice&#8212;that are partially suppressed, as expected in the quantum-coherent regime of the lattice field theory at finite temperature. Our result allows an estimate for the speed of light associated with magnetic photon excitations. We also reveal a continuum of inelastic spin excitations, which resemble predictions for the fractionalized, topological excitations of a quantum spin ice. Taken together, these two signatures suggest that the low-energy physics of Pr<sub>2</sub>Hf<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> can be described by emergent quantum electrodynamics. If confirmed, the observation of a quantum spin ice ground state would constitute a concrete example of a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid&#8212;a topical state of matter that has so far mostly been explored in lower dimensionalities.</p>",<p>在量子自旋液体中，组成电子自旋的磁矩规避了经典的远距离顺序，从而形成了一个奇特的状态，该状态在宏观的长度尺度上是量子纠缠和相干的。这些阶段为量子信息技术中的设备应用提供了广阔的前景，它们的研究可以揭示量子物质中的新物理学。量子自旋冰是一种这样的状态的吸引人的提议，其中基本的基态属性和激发由新兴的U（1）晶格规理论描述。这种量子相干态具有准粒子，它们的行为像磁单极子和电单极子一样，并且具有起人造光子作用的标准玻色子。但是，这种新兴的晶格量子电动力学已在实验中被证明是难以捉摸的。在这里，我们报告稀土烧绿石磁体Pr <sub> 2 </ sub> Hf <sub> 2 </ sub> O <sub> 7 </ sub>的中子散射测量，这为量子自旋冰的基态提供了证据。我们发现了具有夹点的准弹性结构因子，这是经典自旋冰的特征，在有限温度下，其被部分抑制，这是晶格场理论的量子相干方案所期望的。我们的结果可以估算与磁光子激发相关的光速。我们还揭示了一个连续的非弹性自旋激发，类似于对量子自旋冰的分数化拓扑激发的预测。综上所述，这两个特征提示Pr <sub> 2 </ sub> Hf <sub> 2 </ sub> O <sub> 7 </ sub>的低能物理性质可以用新兴的量子电动力学来描述。如果得到证实，对量子自旋冰基态的观察将构成三维量子自旋液体的具体示例，这是迄今为止主要在低维中探索的物质局部状态。</ p>

In most cases, those transitions are controlled by a single type of topological objects. There are, however, some situations, still poorly understood, where two dual topological excitations fight to control the phase diagram and the transition. Finding experimental realizations of such cases is thus of considerable interest. We show here that this situation occurs in BaCo<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, a spin-1/2 Ising-like quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet, when subjected to a uniform magnetic field transverse to the Ising axis. Using neutron scattering experiments, we measure a drastic modification of the quantum excitations beyond a critical value of the magnetic field. This quantum phase transition is identified, through a comparison with theoretical calculations, to be a transition between two different types of solitonic topological object, which are captured by different components of the dynamical structure factor.</p>",<p>自从Berezinskii，Kosterlitz和Thouless的开创性思想以来，拓扑激发一直是我们对整个新型相变理解的核心。在大多数情况下，这些过渡由单一类型的拓扑对象控制。但是，在某些情况下，人们仍然不太了解，其中两个双重拓扑激发会争夺控制相图和跃迁的能力。因此，找到这种情况的实验性实现引起了极大的兴趣。我们在这里显示这种情况发生在BaCo <sub> 2 </ sub> V <sub> 2 </ sub> O <sub> 8 </ sub>中，这是自旋1/2的类似于伊辛的一维反铁磁体，当受到横向于Ising轴的均匀磁场时。使用中子散射实验，我们测量了超出磁场临界值的量子激发的急剧变化。通过与理论计算的比较，该量子相变被确定为两种不同类型的孤子拓扑对象之间的过渡，这些瞬变被动态结构因子的不同组成部分捕获。</ p> 
10.1038/s41567-018-0077-0,Classical topological order in the kinetics of artificial spin ice,人造自旋冰动力学的经典拓扑顺序 ,"<p>Systems of interacting nanomagnets known as artificial spin ice have allowed the design, realization and study of geometrically frustrated exotic collective states that are absent in natural magnets. We have experimentally measured the thermally induced moment fluctuations in the Shakti geometry of artificial spin ice. We show that its disordered moment configuration is a topological phase described by an emergent dimer-cover model with excitations that can be characterized as topologically charged defects. Examination of the low-energy dynamics of the system confirms that these effective topological charges have long lifetimes associated with their topological protection, that is, they can be created and annihilated only as charge pairs with opposite sign and are kinetically constrained. This manifestation of classical topological order demonstrates that geometrical design in nanomagnetic systems can lead to emergent, topologically protected kinetics that can limit pathways to equilibration and ergodicity.</p>",<p>被称为人工自旋冰的相互作用的纳米磁铁系统允许设计，实现和研究天然磁铁中不存在的几何受挫的奇异集体状态。我们已经通过实验测量了人工旋转冰的Shakti几何形状中的热诱发矩波动。我们表明，它的无序矩构型是由具有可表征为拓扑带电缺陷的激发的二聚体覆盖模型描述的拓扑阶段。对系统的低能量动态进行检查，可以确认这些有效的拓扑电荷具有与拓扑保护相关的长寿命，也就是说，它们只能作为具有相反符号且受动力学约束的电荷对生成和消除。经典拓扑顺序的这种表现表明，纳米磁性系统中的几何设计可以导致出现受拓扑保护的紧急动力学，从而限制了平衡和遍历的路径。</ p> 
10.1038/s41567-018-0099-7,Spontaneous shear flow in confined cellular nematics,有限元向列中的自发剪切流 ,"<p>In embryonic development or tumour evolution, cells often migrate collectively within confining tracks defined by their microenvironment. In some of these situations, the displacements within a cell strand are antiparallel, giving rise to shear flows. However, the mechanisms underlying these spontaneous flows remain poorly understood. Here, we show that an ensemble of spindle-shaped cells plated in a well-defined stripe spontaneously develops a shear flow whose characteristics depend on the width of the stripe. On wide stripes, the cells self-organize in a nematic phase with a director at a well-defined angle with the stripe&#8217;s direction, and develop a shear flow close to the stripe&#8217;s edges. However, on stripes narrower than a critical width, the cells perfectly align with the stripe&#8217;s direction and the net flow vanishes. A hydrodynamic active gel theory provides an understanding of these observations and identifies the transition between the non-flowing phase oriented along the stripe and the tilted phase exhibiting shear flow as a Fr&#233;edericksz transition driven by the activity of the cells. This physical theory is grounded in the active nature of the cells and based on symmetries and conservation laws, providing a generic mechanism to interpret in vivo antiparallel cell displacements.</p>",<p>在胚胎发育或肿瘤进化中，细胞通常在其微环境所定义的封闭轨迹内共同迁移。在某些情况下，细胞链内的位移是反平行的，从而产生剪切流动。但是，对这些自发流动的机理仍知之甚少。在这里，我们显示了镀在明确定义的条带中的纺锤形细胞的整体自发地产生了剪切流，其特性取决于条带的宽度。在宽条带上，细胞在一个向列相中以指向子的方式自组织，该指向矢与条带的方向具有明确的角度，并在条带的边缘附近产生剪切流。但是，在比临界宽度窄的条带上，单元格与条带的方向完美对齐，并且净流量消失了。流体动力学活性凝胶理论提供了对这些观察结果的理解，并确定了沿条带取向的非流动相与表现出剪切流的倾斜相之间的过渡，这是由细胞活性驱动的Fr edericksz过渡。这种物理理论基于细胞的活跃特性，并基于对称性和守恒定律，提供了一种解释体内反平行细胞位移的通用机制。</ p> 
10.1038/s41567-018-0103-2,Attosecond coupled electron and nuclear dynamics in dissociative ionization of H2,H2的解离电离中的阿秒耦合电子和核动力学 ,"<p>The interaction of an extreme-ultraviolet attosecond pulse with a molecular system suddenly removes electrons, which can lead to significant changes in the chemical bonding and hence to rearrangements of the residual molecular cation. The timescales of the electronic and nuclear dynamics are usually very different, thus supporting separate treatment. However, when light nuclei are involved, as in most organic and biological molecules containing atomic hydrogen, the correlation between electronic and nuclear motion cannot be ignored. Using an advanced attosecond pump&#8211;probe spectroscopic method, we show that the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion in H<sub>2</sub> leaves a clear trace in the phase of the entangled electron&#8211;nuclear wave packet. This requires us to re-evaluate the physical meaning of the measured phase, which depends on the energy distribution between electrons and nuclei. The conclusions are supported by ab initio calculations that explicitly account for the coupling between electronic and nuclear dynamics.</p>",<p>极紫外阿秒脉冲与分子系统的相互作用会突然除去电子，这可能导致化学键发生重大变化，从而导致残留分子阳离子发生重排。电子动力学和核动力学的时间尺度通常非常不同，因此支持单独的处理。但是，当涉及轻核时，就像在大多数包含原子氢的有机分子和生物分子中一样，电子运动与核运动之间的相关性也不容忽视。使用先进的阿秒泵光谱法，我们发现H <sub> 2 </ sub>中电子运动与核运动之间的耦合在纠缠的电子核波包的相位中留下了清晰的痕迹。这就要求我们重新评估被测相的物理意义，这取决于电子与原子核之间的能量分布。这些结论得到了从头算的支持，该算子明确地说明了电子动力学与核动力学之间的耦合。</ p>

Superconductivity and superfluidity have their origin in Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation. Ultracold quantum gases have provided condensates close to the original ideas of Bose and Einstein, while condensation of polaritons and magnons has introduced novel concepts of non-equilibrium condensation. Here, we demonstrate a Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate of surface plasmon polaritons in lattice modes of a metal nanoparticle array. Interaction of the nanoscale-confined surface plasmons with a room-temperature bath of dye molecules enables thermalization and condensation in picoseconds. The ultrafast thermalization and condensation dynamics are revealed by an experiment that exploits thermalization under propagation and the open-cavity character of the system. A crossover from a Bose&#8211;Einstein condensate to usual lasing is realized by tailoring the band structure. This new condensate of surface plasmon lattice excitations has promise for future technologies due to its ultrafast, room-temperature and on-chip nature.</p>",<p>玻色＆＃8211;爱因斯坦凝聚是量子统计和宏观量子相干性的显着表现。超导性和超流动性起源于Bose爱因斯坦凝聚。超冷量子气体提供的冷凝物接近Bose和Einstein的最初想法，而极化子和磁振子的冷凝则引入了新的非平衡冷凝概念。在这里，我们证明了在金属纳米粒子阵列的晶格模式下表面等离振子极化子的玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体。纳米级受限表面等离子体激元与染料分子室温浴的相互作用，使热化和凝聚能达到皮秒级。超快的热化和冷凝动力学是通过一个实验来揭示的，该实验利用了系统传播和开放腔特性下的热化。通过调整能带结构，可以实现从Bose爱因斯坦冷凝物到常规激光的转换。表面等离子体激元晶格激发的这种新冷凝物因其超快，室温和片上性质而有望用于未来技术。</ p> 
10.1038/s41567-018-0137-5,Weak ergodicity breaking from quantum many-body scars,弱的遍历性突破了量子多体疤痕 ,"<p>The thermodynamic description of many-particle systems rests on the assumption of ergodicity, the ability of a system to explore all allowed configurations in the phase space. Recent studies on many-body localization have revealed the existence of systems that strongly violate ergodicity in the presence of quenched disorder. Here, we demonstrate that ergodicity can be weakly broken by a different mechanism, arising from the presence of special eigenstates in the many-body spectrum that are reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic non-interacting systems. In the single-particle case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum but lead to direct experimental signatures, as we show for periodic recurrences that reproduce those observed in the experiment. Our results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, opening up opportunities for the creation of novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now experimentally realizable.</p>",<p>多粒子系统的热力学描述基于遍历性的假设，即系统探索相空间中所有允许构型的能力。最近有关多体定位的研究表明，存在淬灭性疾病时强烈违反遍历性的系统存在。在这里，我们证明，由于多体光谱中特殊本征态的存在而引起的遍历性可以通过不同的机制弱化，这使人联想到混沌非相互作用系统中的量子疤痕。在单粒子情况下，量子疤痕对应于集中在不稳定的周期性经典轨迹附近的波函数。我们表明，斐波纳契链中出现了多体疤痕，该模型具有受约束的局部希尔伯特空间，最近已在里德堡原子量子模拟器中通过实验实现。量子疤痕本征态嵌入否则会变热的多体光谱中，但会导致直接的实验特征，如我们所显示的周期性重复可再现实验中观察到的。我们的结果表明，伤痕累累的多体带产生了一种新的量子动力学通用性类别，这为创建具有长相干性的新型状态创造了机会，这些状态现在可以通过实验实现。</ p>

Polarization of actin and the molecular motor non-muscle myosin II in the cells adjacent to the wound results in the formation of a supracellular cable around the wound that drives repair. In Drosophila embryos, the distribution of actin around wounds is heterogeneous, with regions of high and low actin density, and actin heterogeneity is necessary for rapid repair. Here, we demonstrate that actin and myosin display stochastic patterns around embryonic wounds, and that contractile forces around wounds are heterogeneous. Mathematical modelling suggests that actomyosin heterogeneity favours wound closure if myosin is regulated by tension and strain, a hypothesis that we validate experimentally. We show that inhibition of stretch-activated ion channels disrupts myosin dynamics and tissue repair. Together, our results indicate that staggered contractile events, mechanical signals and force-regulated myosin dynamics coordinate cell behaviours to drive efficient wound closure.</p>",<p>在细胞协调运动的推动下，胚胎伤口迅速愈合。肌动蛋白和伤口附近细胞中肌动蛋白和分子运动非肌肉肌球蛋白II的极化导致伤口周围形成超细胞电缆，从而驱动修复。在果蝇胚胎中，肌动蛋白在伤口周围的分布是不均匀的，具有高和低的肌动蛋白密度区域，而肌动蛋白的异质性对于快速修复是必需的。在这里，我们证明肌动蛋白和肌球蛋白在胚胎伤口周围显示随机模式，并且伤口周围的收缩力是异质的。数学模型表明，如果肌球蛋白受到张力和应变的调节，则肌动球蛋白的异质性有利于伤口闭合，我们通过实验验证了这一假设。我们表明抑制拉伸激活离子通道破坏肌球蛋白动力学和组织修复。在一起，我们的结果表明交错的收缩事件，机械信号和力调节肌球蛋白动力学协调细胞行为以驱动有效的伤口闭合。</ p>

This seemingly chaotic process creates two dominant bedforms: decametre-scale dunes and centimetre-scale ripples, but hardly anything in between. By the very same process, grains are constantly sorted. Smaller grains advance faster, while heavier grains trail behind. Here, we argue that, under erosive conditions, sand sorting and structure formation can conspire to create distinct bedforms in the &#8216;forbidden wavelength gap&#8217; between aeolian ripples and dunes. These so-called megaripples are shown to co-evolve with an unusual, predominantly bimodal grain-size distribution. Combining theory and field measurements, we develop a mechanistic understanding of their formation, shape and migration, as well as their cyclic ageing, renewal and sedimentary memory, in terms of the intermittent wind statistics. Our results demonstrate that megaripples exhibit close similarities to dunes and can indeed be mechanistically characterized as a special type of (&#8216;reptation&#8217;) dune.</p>",<p>湍急的风将沙子吹过海滩和沙漠。这个看似混乱的过程产生了两种主要的床形：十米尺度的沙丘和厘米尺度的涟漪，但两者之间几乎没有任何关系。通过相同的过程，谷物不断地被分类。较小的谷物前进得更快，而较重的谷物则落后。在这里，我们认为，在侵蚀条件下，沙子的分选和结构的形成可以共同在“禁止的波长间隙”中创建明显的床形。在风沙和沙丘之间。这些所谓的巨型波纹显示出与不寻常的，主要是双峰的粒度分布共同演化。结合理论和现场测量，我们从间歇风统计的角度对它们的形成，形状和迁移以及它们的周期性老化，更新和沉积记忆有了机械的理解。我们的研究结果表明，巨波纹与沙丘具有相似性，并且可以机械地表征为特殊类型的沙丘（＆p8216; reptation＆＃8217;）沙丘。</ p>
